Theme ***Interrelationships*** "@OMD". TOPIC 12.3 ***ASSOCIATIONS IN BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES*** "18 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates that organisms naturally interact in different ways with one another in a given habitat. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know what competition is and describe how organisms compete in nature (k, u); b) differentiate prey from predators and describe a predator-prey relationship (u, s); c) understand symbiosis, mutualism, commensalism and parasitism and appreciate their roles in an ecosystem (k, u); d) recognise the role of parasites and vectors in the transmission of common diseases (malaria, bilharzia, nagana, and sleeping sickness) (k, u, v); e) know the adaptations of parasites to their mode of life (u). • Observe areas with dense natural populations of animals such as a farm or garbage pit, or observe video clips, noting which organisms seem to be competing for the same type of food and/or the same space, and report how the organisms behaved and which seemed to dominate. • In pairs, brainstorm examples of predator-prey relationships and present your conclusions in a chart showing what eats what (regular relationships only, not including, for example, man eating lions). (Encourage thinking about smaller organisms, invertebrates). • In pairs, examine collected numerical data relating to a prey-predator relationship and plot a prey-predator curve (MS Excel, if applicable). Describe and explain the curve orally and in writing. • In groups, research the meanings of the terms symbiosis, mutualism, commensalism and parasitism, and produce a poster/graphic image explaining each term and giving natural examples. • Visit a nearby health/agricultural facility, or listen to a visiting health/ agricultural officer, and/or carry out research, to find out about and then report on common parasitic diseases, how they are transmitted and how they can be prevented. • Develop and present a role play to show how different parasites are adapted to their mode of life and how humans try to prevent their transmission.
