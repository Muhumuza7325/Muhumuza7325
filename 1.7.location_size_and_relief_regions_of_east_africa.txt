Theme ***Introduction to East Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 7 ***LOCATION, SIZE, AND RELIEF REGIONS OF EAST AFRICA*** "4 PERIODS". Competency; The learner knows the countries that make up East Africa; their comparative sizes in area and population; and the main relief regions they are divided into. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) use maps, statistics, graphs and diagrams to analyse population (s); b) appreciate that East African countries vary greatly in area and population (a, v, gs); c) know the East African countries, their approximate population and area (k); d) use contours to show physical features on maps and draw cross-sections from simple contour maps (s). The countries • answer questions about the countries making up East Africa to determine what you know about their comparative size and population. Then work in groups to research and create your own table of information regarding this, comparing results and explaining your use of sources. • Answers may differ as there are two definitions; countries linked into a geographical region and countries which have joined the political Community of East Africa. This expands as more countries join. Ask which countries are in each. • Explain that in this syllabus we are using the traditional idea of East Africa as Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Physical or relief regions • Use wall map, sketch map on BB or atlas relief map of East Africa to ask questions e.g., position and names of highland areas, plateaus, coastal plains etc. • Name main relief regions on sketch map • study one or more local features through fieldwork, collecting samples, taking photographs and creating a labelled map display to show the physical environment and the influence of relief on weather and climate. Add the location of some past and present physical hazards and link to a short piece of text explaining what happened/might happen and how severe the threat is. • work in groups to draw a map showing relief regions and collaborate to identify and explain regions where there is or has been a high hazard risk.
