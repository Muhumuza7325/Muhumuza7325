Atomic mass is the average mass of one mole of atoms of an element. Relative atomic mass is the mass of an atom of an element compared to 1/12ᵗʰ of the mass of the carbon-12 atom. Relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity because it's a ratio. Is there a false statement?;
The relative atomic mass is not always a whole number due to the presence of isotopes. In such a case, the value is obtained by taking the average of the relative masses of isotopes of an element based on their natural abundance. Is this true?;

Relative Molecular Mass is a dimensionless quantity that represents the mass of one molecule of a substance relative to the mass of 1/12ᵗʰ of a carbon-12 atom.

Avogadro's law states that at constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas. Could this be false?;
80cm³ of oxygen are exploded with 80cm³ of hydrogen, Is the volume of the unused gas at room temperature, 40cm³?;
