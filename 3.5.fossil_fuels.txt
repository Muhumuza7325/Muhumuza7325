[Assignment 1] {What are the types and origins of fossil fuels and why are they useful materials that can be even used as sources of energy}. Fossil fuels are energy resources formed from the preserved remains of ancient photosynthetic organisms (plants, algae, phytoplankton, and certain photosynthetic bacteria) that lived millions of years ago. These organisms absorbed carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere or that which was dissolved in water) and converted it, along with water, into organic compounds through photosynthesis, utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Over time, the organic matter from these ancient organisms became buried under sediment layers, where it underwent decomposition and transformation under heat and pressure. This process led to the formation of coal, petroleum (crude oil), and natural gas, the 3 main fossil fuels, which are extracted and used as energy sources today. Coal usually forms from terrestrial plant matter through compression and transformation in swampy environments; petroleum usually forms from aquatic organisms through chemical changes in sedimentary basins; and natural gas forms from thermal decomposition of organic matter in deeper, hotter underground formations. Please note that the details of petroleum and natural gas were covered in Topic 9, Carbon in life. In this very chapter, we shall exclusively focus on coal. **Coal**. Coal is a hard, black coloured substance formed primarily from compressed and decomposed plant matter. Its main components are carbon, hydrogen, and sulphur, with some oxygen and nitrogen present in smaller amounts. There are three major types of coal, each with distinct characteristics: Anthracite: The highest rank coal, meaning it has the highest concentration of carbon (86%-97%) and the least moisture. Anthracite is hard, brittle, and burns very hot and clean. It is the hardest type of coal. Bituminous: The most common type of coal, containing a moderate amount of carbon (45%–86%). Bituminous coal is black and softer than anthracite. It's a versatile fuel used for electricity generation and steel production. Lignite: The lowest rank coal, with the lowest amount of carbon (25%–35%) and the highest moisture content. Lignite is a soft, brown coal that burns less efficiently than other types. Coal isn't just a source of raw energy; it can be processed industrially to obtain valuable derivatives. Heating coal in the absence of air/coking yields coke, a hard, high-carbon fuel essential for steel production. This process also produces coal tar, a complex mixture of organic compounds used as a starting material for chemicals like creosote and benzene. In addition, heating coal with limited oxygen creates coal gas, a combustible mixture once widely used for lighting, heating, and cooking. While coal is not a major fuel source in Uganda, it can be used in some industrial processes elsewhere. Coal can be used to generate electricity through steam turbines, but this is not common in Uganda. Coke, derived from coal, is a crucial ingredient for steel production, but Uganda likely imports coke due to its minimal coal industry. Syngas, produced from coal gasification, can be converted into chemicals like methanol and ammonia. However, large-scale coal gasification is unlikely in Uganda due to low coal usage. Advantages of using fossil fuels. Fossil fuels have powered our civilization for centuries due to several advantages. They are champions of high energy density, packing a lot of power into a small space, ideal for large-scale electricity generation. Fossil fuels are also readily available, with ongoing exploration and extraction efforts keeping reserves accessible in many regions. Their established infrastructure makes them cost-effective, though this advantage is facing pressure from developing renewable energy sources. Transporting oil and gas is a breeze, thanks to the convenient pipeline networks. Safety improvements in extraction, transportation, and use have also significantly reduced risks. Despite being a finite resource, fossil fuels are available in plenty. Disadvantages of using fossil fuels. Fossil fuels pose a significant challenge to our environment and health. Burning them releases harmful greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, a major contributor to climate change and acid rain. Fossil fuels are also a finite resource, meaning they will eventually deplete. Extracting these fuels can be hazardous, leading to health problems like black lung disease in coal miners and respiratory issues in natural gas drillers. Furthermore, spills and leaks during extraction, transportation, and storage can pollute air, water, and soil, harming ecosystems and wildlife. Fossil fuel dependence can also lead to geopolitical issues as countries vie for access to these resources. These drawbacks are driving the urgent need to shift towards cleaner, renewable energy sources.
