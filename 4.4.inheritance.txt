Theme ***Genetics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 11.1 ***INHERITANCE*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates that transmission of characteristics is from parents to offspring through a process known as heredity. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the process of cell division and significance of meiosis (k, u); b) understand the concept of inheritance using genetic diagrams (u, s); c) understand and explain sex determination in humans (u, s); d) understand and explain sex linkage in humans (u, s). • In groups or pairs, view an animation on meiotic cell division. Research using other sources, and then: identify the stages and describe what occurs at each phase using annotated diagrams and notes • explain (verbally and in notes) the significance of meiotic cell division in maintaining the chromosome number • In groups, research on inheritance, and develop an activity using coloured beads to explain the concept to the rest of the class. Ensure that individuals explain using annotated diagrams. • In groups, research the meanings of the following terms: chromosome, gene, dominant and recessive, heterozygous and homozygous, phenotype and genotype. Share your understanding with the whole class using visual aids you create. Ensure that individuals explain using annotated diagrams. • In groups, research on, discuss and explain sex determination and sex linkage using relevant examples. Ensure that individuals explain using annotated diagrams.
