Theme ***Further use of maps; introduction to the rest of Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 21 ***THE RELIEF REGIONS AND DRAINAGE OF AFRICA*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner knows the relief regions of Africa, the major landforms and drainage and understands how they were formed and the effects of the relief and drainage on development. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the names and positions of the major relief regions of Africa (k); b) recognise physical features from photographs (s); c) draw diagrams to show the formation of important physical features (s); d) understand the characteristics of important physical features in Africa and East Africa, including mountain ranges, plateaus, basins and rift valleys (u); e) understand the main concept of plate tectonics and how it has led to the formation of the main physical features of Africa and East Africa (u); f) use a sketch map to show the major relief regions, rivers and lakes in Africa(s); g) understand how different landforms affect the lives of people (u); h) appreciate that many areas contain very old rocks that are not very good for soil formation but rich in minerals (v, a, gs); i) understand the effects of the landforms on development, including agriculture and mining (u); j) understand the importance of rivers and lakes to development (u); k) appreciate that rivers and lakes can be useful but can as also be spoilt by pollution (v, a, gs); l) understand how their own lives and the lives of their communities are affected by physical features, including natural hazards (u); m) understand through case studies how the physical features affect the lives of people in selected areas of East Africa (u); n) use field work to study any of the above physical features in the local area (s); o) understand how water resources are used and controlled (u). Relief regions • work in groups to research and create your own 2D or 3D maps, adding features as you learn about them. • Using a wall map and atlas map or Internet map showing the relief of Africa and images, including aerial images, locate and describe the position of the main mountain areas of Africa. • Which kind of relief occupies the largest area in other parts of Africa: plateaus or coastal plains. • Explain that, apart from high mountains, most of Africa contains plateaus with small areas of coastal plains. Formation of landforms • Through questioning, revise the formation of volcanoes and block mountains. • Explain that the mountains of Africa are either old or new volcanic mountains (Ethiopian highlands, Cameroon, Drakensburg and the volcanoes of East Africa), block mountains (Rwenzoris) or folded mountains (Atlas). • Look up Drakensburg and Atlas Mountains on Internet or in textbooks and make notes about their origins and age. • Explain the difference between the origin of the Drakensburg and Mountain Elgon or Mountain Kilimanjaro. • Use modeling techniques and diagrams to assist to understand folded mountains: Atlas Mountains. • Explain that much of Africa consists of very ancient rocks forming plateaus. Are rocks on such plateaus likely to form good soils? (old hard rocks not easily broken down or weathered). • Explain that old rocks do contain many minerals e.g., copper, gold, uranium so there are many mining areas in Africa • Explore that on some coastal plains and in river valleys, sedimentary rocks have been deposited e.g., Niger delta. These form fertile soils and also in some areas contain oil deposits. • Develop your maps, devising your own key to show regions and features you have investigated and learnt about. Drainage • Use an atlas, wall map or Internet map to identify main rivers and lakes of Africa. Add these features to your own maps. • Suggest the ways in which these rivers and lakes benefit the people of Africa. • suggest the problems the people of Africa face in using the rivers and lakes. • create a case study of an area where agriculture or mining has thrived and explain how landforms have influenced people’s way of life there. • Investigate the local area through fieldwork and map the key landforms and development in the area, explaining connections between the two.
