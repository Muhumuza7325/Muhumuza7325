Theme ***Electricity*** "@OMD". TOPIC 7 ***ELECTROSTATICS*** "8 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should understand electrostatics and use electrostatics to explain lightning and other phenomena. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand everyday effects of static electricity and explain them in terms of the build-up and transfer of electrical charge (u, s); b) apply knowledge of electrostatic charge to explain the operation of devices like lightening conductors (u, s, v/a). • In pairs, research on and discuss everyday examples of the effects of static electricity, such as charging of a balloon (to pick up bits of paper), a comb or some clothing, and explain on a poster: • how friction generates electric charge that builds up on an insulator • how charging by induction occurs • how charge can be transferred • the particles responsible for the charge • In groups, use a gold leaf electroscope and explain on a poster or presentation how: • it is charged • a buildup of charge is transferred • how opposite charges attract and like charges repel • In pairs, research and report on: • occurrences of lightning in Uganda • the causes of lightening (a static discharge that builds up due to friction when bodies of air pass over each other) and how lightening conductors work • how to stay safe in a thunderstorm. Note: The Faraday ice pail experiment and van der Graaf generator should be left out;
