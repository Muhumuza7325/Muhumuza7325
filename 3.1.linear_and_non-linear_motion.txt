Theme ***Mechanics and Properties of Matter*** "@OMD". Topic 1 ***Linear and non-linear motion*** "30 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to devise activities to measure distance and short time intervals, and he/she should be able to use the data to calculate the speed and acceleration of a moving object and explain their implications. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand and apply the relationship between speed, distance, and time (u, s); b) understand the terms; linear motion, speed, average speed, acceleration, and be able to investigate resistance to motion (u, s); c) know and use the equations of motion (u, s); d) understand the acceleration of bodies moving in a circle and the effect of gravity and air resistance on moving bodies (u, s); e) understand linear momentum and that it is conserved during collisions (u, s); f) understand that momentum is conserved during a collision and the implication of this (u, s, v/a); g) understand and apply Newton's laws of motion (u, s, v/a); h) understand the differences between vector and scalar quantities, and give examples of each (u); i) understand that a number of forces acting on a body can be represented by a single resultant force (u, s). • In groups, plan and carry out an investigation to find the speed of someone walking, running, riding a bicycle, and travelling in a car between two points, using speed = distance/time. • In pairs: • interpret and construct distance/time graphs and velocity-time graphs • calculate the average speed of objects moving between two points, and explain, on a poster, linear motion and the difference between speed and average speed. • In groups, measure acceleration using a ticker timer and explain in a report, the graph for uniform acceleration and linear motion. • In groups, use data to solve problems, using the formula v=u+at and other equations. • In groups, plan and report on an investigation into the motion of a body falling in a viscous fluid, and the effects of shape/streamlining on the motion. Explain distance/time graphs for this motion, and the implications of shape in birds, fish and planes. • In pairs, research and explain on a poster, the speed and acceleration of bodies moving in a circle and describe the effect of gravity and air resistance on the motion. • In groups, research what momentum is, and report on your findings and use the relation p=mv in various ways. • In groups, use an air track to investigate and explain to the class the conservation of linear momentum and how it is affected by changes to mass and velocity. • In groups, draw on prior learning to explain with a presentation or a poster: - the Newton as a unit of force - the effect on velocity of applying forces of different size to objects of different mass - the use of the formula F=ma. • In pairs, research on Newton’s laws and their implications and explain the following in a report, with examples: • how action and reaction are equal and opposite • the difference between vector and scalar quantities. • In groups, use pulleys to investigate and report on the direction and size of the result force when two forces act at right angles on the same object. Note: a) The derivation of the equations of motion is not required; b) Numerical problems on motion in a circle are not required; c) Problems related to objects projected at an angle to the horizontal are beyond the scope of this syllabus.
