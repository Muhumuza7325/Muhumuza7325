into terminating, non-terminating
and recurring decimals. (u)
g) converts recurring decimals into
fractions. (u, s)
h) converts fractions and decimals into
percentages and vice versa. (u s)
i) calculates a percentage of a given
quantity. (s)

• Fold paper strips to model fractions and use
to determine equivalent fractions including
decimals
• Order and locate fractions on a number line
• Understand decimals as fractions with
powers of ten as a denominator
(tenths, hundredths etc.)
• Understand percentages as fractions with
100 as the denominator
• Play games matching fractions,
percentage and decimals
• Identify percentages in every day contexts
• Use a calculator to investigate fraction-
decimal equivalence – which fractions
produce terminating decimals and which
fractions produce recurring decimals?
• Developing strategies for converting
decimals to fractions
• Solve problems that involve
fractions, percentages and decimals
