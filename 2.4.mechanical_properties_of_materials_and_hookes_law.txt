Theme ***Mechanics and properties of matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 4 ***MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS; HOOKE’S LAW*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should investigate and understand how the mechanical properties of different materials are related to their applications. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand how the mechanical properties of common materials can be utilised in physical structures (u, s, v/a); b) understand that the tensile strength of materials is determined by the properties of the substances they are composed of (u); c) understand that heating changes the structure and properties of some materials (u). • In groups, use prior learning and research to explain in a report the meaning of the following characteristics, and name common materials that exhibit these properties: • brittle • ductile • strong • hard • malleable • flexible • elastic. • In pairs, construct and test to destruction model bridges made out of different materials (wooden sticks, straws, spaghetti) and produce a report in which you: • relate physical properties to their characteristics • identify material used in everyday life and research and relate their use to their properties • explain, in terms of particle theory, why heating materials changes their structure and properties. • In pairs, research on the stress lines of beams under tension and compressive stress, and then explain how reinforcing concrete changes its properties. • In groups, investigate, research and report on the relationship between the load and the stretching effect on springs or rubber bands of different dimensions and make a presentation to explain: • the impact of variation of load on extension of elastic materials in a graph • the concepts of stress and strain • Hooke’s law and its relevance to the findings • In groups, investigate the relationship between the diameter of a tube and its tensile strength. On a poster, report the results and relate the findings to the structure of the bone and to the use of materials in construction. • In groups, investigate and report on the strength of concrete strips made with different proportions of sand and cement, comparing their properties and relating them to the balance of sand/cement. • In groups, compare the different constructional materials such as glass, wood, ceramics, and steel and make a report;
