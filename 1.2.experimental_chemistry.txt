[Group Work 1] {Find out the laboratory rules and regulations and understand the importance of risk assessment in order to work safely with in the laboratory and know action required in the event of an accident}. Experimental chemistry is the science of observation. One makes an observation, asks a question to nature, carries out corresponding experiments, and observes the outcome. Chemistry is studied in a special place called a laboratory. A laboratory is place of adventure and discovery. A laboratory is a special place with special equipment where scientific investigations or experiments are carried out. An investigation is a set of instructions or procedures that must be followed in order to come up with a conclusion. The laboratories are home for some of the most exciting events in the history of science e.g., the discovery of oxygen. The chemistry laboratory is stocked with different types of chemicals and apparatus. Chemicals are substances usually in solid or liquid form that are consumed during reactions. They get used up in reactions during the course of an experiment. Most of these chemicals in the chemistry laboratory are harmful to the human body and the apparatus are breakable if not handled carefully. Apparatus are scientific tools that are used in carrying out scientific experiments. They are not used up or consumed and can be used repeatedly. It is important for beginners in form one to be acquainted with laboratory rules and safety measures before they can confidently use the chemistry laboratory. Laboratory rules and safety measures are to safeguard users and others while in the laboratory. When a student is in the laboratory, there are simple rules to be followed. Below are some of the laboratory rules and regulations. a) Do not enter the laboratory without permission. b) Ensure that any loose clothing is carefully tucked in to avoid accidents. c) Learn at once the location and operation of fire extinguishers and other first aid materials. d) Avoid unnecessary movements in the laboratory to avoid accidents. e) Put all bags, jackets and stools out of your way before you do any experiment. f) Perform only the experiments assigned by the teacher. g) Do not stand on a stool while carrying out an experiment. h) Always make sure that you carefully follow instructions that are given before and during an experiment and read labels on bottles making sure that you use correct reagents. i) No equipment should be used until proper instructions are received from the teacher and you have proven proficiency. j) Do not play about with electrical or gas devices. k) Handle apparatus with great care. l) Whenever in the laboratory, use clean and dry apparatus. m) Never use faulty equipment. n) Check and make sure that the devices you are given are not damaged. o) To avoid generating a lot of heat, never add water to an acid, instead, add an acid to water. p) Never clean or wash glass apparatus with water when they are still hot to avoid cracking. q) Do not keep your work space too congested. r) In case of accidents such as burns, cuts or splash of chemicals, wash with plenty of water and report immediately to the teacher or laboratory technician. s) Do not taste or smell gases continuously. t) Do not eat or drink anything in the laboratory. u) When heating using boiling tubes or test tubes, do not turn the open end towards yourself or anyone. v) Never dispose off solid material into sinks, instead throw them in solid waste containers or pits. w) Do not leave reagent bottles open. x) As soon as you finish using a bottle, put its stopper and return it to its right position. y) Clean and clear up all apparatus before leaving the laboratory. Other safety measures/precautions include: Gloves to protect hands from chemicals, Gas masks to prevent the user from dangerous gases, Googles to protect the eyes and a Laboratory coat to prevent contact with corrosive chemicals. Please note that some of the reagents used in the laboratory are hazardous. Hazardous reagents could be a risk to health, property and the environment. International rules require that hazardous chemicals are labelled and classified as per set standards. Hazard Warning Labels. To help make the use and handling of chemicals safe, chemicals usually have warning signs on their labels. One should familiar themselves with some of the common warning signs. Figure150.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_011.jpg. Figure150.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_021.jpg.

[Group Work 2] {Know and use laboratory equipment (such as burettes, pipettes, measuring cylinders, thermometers, the Bunsen burner, and balance) appropriately for measuring time, temperature, mass, and volume}. Laboratory apparatus. These are pieces of equipment used in the laboratory for experiments. Glass ware. These are pieces of equipment made of glass. Most of the apparatus in the chemistry laboratory are made of glassware for two major reasons; 1) Glass is transparent and enables the experimenter to observe easily the reactions occurring. 2) Glass does not react with most common laboratory chemicals.

To accurately measure volumes of gases produced in experiments according to the graduated marks on the apparatus. Exercise [Individually research about other laboratory apparatus and their uses]. The heating apparatus used in chemistry laboratory. Some experiments carried out in the laboratory require heating for reactions to occur. Some of the heat sources that can be used in the laboratory include an electric heater, a paraffin stove and commonly a bunsen burner. The Bunsen burner. This is a simple piece of apparatus used in the laboratory for heating substances and it uses gas as a source of fuel. It was designed by a German chemist called Robert Wilhelm in 1811. Figure174.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_025.jpg. The Bunsen burner mixes the gas with air in the correct proportions to give a very hot flame. The gas enters the burner through the jet at the bottom and burns at the top of the chimney. The collar has a hole on each side of it and air can pass through the hole and mix with the gas as it goes up the tube. The amount of air entering can be adjusted by turning the collar. The flames of a candle and burning oil are smoky and luminous (yellow). They are not used for heating in the laboratory for the following reasons: (i) They are not hot enough. (ii) They cover apparatus with black soot (carbon). Functions of parts of a Bunsen burner. 1) Barrel (Chimney). It is a long cylindrical metallic pipe that allows gas to pass through to be used to create a flame. It transmits a mixture of gas and air up to the top of the chimney where it is lit. 2) Collar (Metal ring). It is a movable metal ring used to regulate the amount of air entering through the air holes. When adjusted, it increases or decreases the size of the air hole by making it smaller or bigger. This, as we shall see, determines the type of flame produced. 3) Air hole. It’s an opening that allows air to enter the Bunsen burner so that when it mixes with the gas from the jet, it burns when lit. 4) Jet. This is a tiny hole where the gas enters the burner. It is narrow to provide the necessary pressure to push the gas through the Chimney. The higher the gas pressure, the higher the rate of combustion. 5) Rubber tubing or Gas inlet. It joins the Bunsen burner to the gas cylinder and transmits the gas from the gas cylinder to the jet of the Bunsen burner. The gas inlet could be made of plastic too. 6) Base. This is a heavy metal that ensures the Bunsen burner is stable. It is where the burner sits and gets its support in an upright position. How to light a Bunsen burner. (i) Connect the Bunsen burner to the gas cylinder. (ii) Turn the collar until the air holes are closed. (iii) Turn on the gas fully. (iv) Light the gas immediately at the chimney to produce a flame. (v) Adjust the size of the hole until the flame is about 7cm high. (vi) Open the air holes slowly until the flame is non luminous but not noisy. Safety precaution: Make sure that the gas is turned off when not in use. To extinguish a Bunsen burner flame, close the air holes and turn off the tap. Video5.How_to_use_a_Bunsen_burner_safely.mp4. Bunsen burner flames. A flame are burning gases that give out heat and light. There are two types of flames formed by a Bunsen burner, depending on whether the air holes are opened or closed. 1) Luminous flame (Air holes are closed). This is the flame produced when the air holes are closed such that no air enters the tube. The flame is large, bright, yellow and not very hot. It’s luminous because it gives out light. Examples of luminous flames include: Candle flame, Bush fire flames and Lantern flame. Figure175.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_026.jpg. A luminous flame has four parts or zones with different colours. (a) A dark inner zone of cool, unburnt gas. (b) A luminous yellow zone. The gas burns in this zone but not completely as there is not enough air. It forms about 70% of the flame. Tiny particles glow in this region to give out light. (c) A thin outer zone in which the gas burns completely as there is plenty of air. This zone does not give out light; it’s so difficult to see this zone (It’s a colorless zone). (d) A blue zone at the bottom of the flame. This part receives plenty of air because of rising convection currents. Burning is more complete than in the yellow zone making it very hot. 2) Non luminous flame (Air holes are open). This is a flame produced when the air holes of the Bunsen burner are open. Air enters the tube and mixes with the gas which burns quickly and completely, producing a lot of heat. The flame becomes smaller and hotter. It gives out only a little light because it contains no carbon. Examples of non luminous flames include; Gas cooker flame and Stove flame. The non luminous flame has three zones. Figure176.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_027.jpg. (a) An inner zone of cool unburnt gas. (b) A green or blue middle zone. Some gas burns in this zone, but not all because there is not enough air. (c) A pale blue or purple zone. In this zone, the burning of the gas is more complete and a lot of heat is produced. Burning Back or Strike Back. This is a phenomenon where the flame moves down the chimney and is seen to burn at the jet. It occurs when the air holes of the Bunsen burner are left open and the gas is turned down so that the rate at which the gas is burnt exceeds the rate at which it is supplied from the jet. Burning Back or Strike Back can cause explosion, leading to destruction of property and lives. When burning back occurs, turn off the gas, close the air holes and light the burner again, using the normal procedure. Experiment to find out the hottest part of the Bunsen flame. Get a piece of paper and hold it horizontally. Pass the paper quickly through a non luminous flame around two places. Brown patches form on the paper. The brown patch is formed at the hottest part of the Bunsen burner, located just above the blue or green zone. Differences between luminous and non luminous flame. Figure177.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_028.jpg. Similarities between luminous and non luminous flames. Both flames have the dark zone (zone of unburnt gas). Both flames have a luminous zone where the gas do not burn completely. In this zone, the carbon particles glow to give out light. Both flames have the non luminous zone where gas burns completely. Measurements: Mass, Volume, Time and Temperature. Mass. Mass of a substance is the amount of matter it contains. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and grams (g). Conversion of Mass. 1000mg = 1g. 1000g = 1kg. 1000kg = 1 tonne. There are two main devices to measure mass of a substance: Beam balance and electronic balance. In a beam balance, a weight is moved along a horizontal scale until it balances the mass of object on the scale pan. Figure179.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_001.jpg. An electronic balance is easy to use and can measure to accuracy of 0.001g very quickly. Figure180.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_002.jpg. Volume. Volume of a substance is the amount of space it occupies. Unit for measuring volume is cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic decimeters (dm³), cubic meters (m³) and litres. Conversion of volumes. 1000cm³ = 1dm³. 1dm³ = 1litre. 1000dm³ = 1m³. Time. Time is the interval between two occurrences. Time is measured using a stopwatch or stop clock. Measuring unit for time is a second (s). Most stopwatches measure to accuracy of 0.01s. Conversion of Time. 60s = 1min. 60min = 1h. 24h = 1day. Temperature. The degree of hotness and coldness is called temperature. The temperature of a liquid or gas can be measured using a thermometer. Measuring unit for temperature is ⁰C. The temperatures on the absolute temperature scale/Kelvin scale are measured in kelvins and are obtained by adding 273.15 to the temperature on the Celsius scale. i.e., 273.15K = 0˚C. Laboratory methods of preparing gases. The following steps are involved when preparing a gas: 1) Production. Reagents are mixed in a reaction vessel and the gas is produced. Gases are produced by a number of chemical reactions e.g., action of heat on solids and reaction of acids with solids. Different set-ups for gas preparation are made, depending on the conditions for the reactions and the nature of the substances being used to prepare the gas. a) If heat is to be applied to the reactants, a round bottomed flask or a boiling tube is used. If water is one of the products produced by heating solids, the flask or boiling tube has to be placed in a slanting position (Why)?. Figure181.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_003.jpg. b) If there is no heating involved, a conical flask with a side arm or a flat-bottomed flask is used. The flask is placed on a flat surface. c) If one of the reactants is a solid, and the other is an aqueous solution, the aqueous solution is added through a funnel (thistle or dropping) into the solids placed in the flask. d) For a continuous supply of a gas, when solids react with aqueous solutions, Kipps apparatus is used. e) Gases that are poisonous and/or with an unpleasant smell, are prepared in the fume cupboard. E.g., carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide. 2) Purification. The gas is passed through another reagent normally in a wash bottle to remove the impurities. 3) Drying. Substances that contain water can be dried by drying agents or desiccants. When gases are required dry, as in most cases, they are passed through liquid and solid desiccants. Desiccants are substances that have a very high affinity for water (water loving compounds) and therefore remove water from other substances. Desiccants are usually hygroscopic substances. Examples of desiccants for gases include: concentrated sulphuric acid, anhydrous calcium chloride, calcium oxide and silica gel. a) Concentrated sulphuric acid - the gas is passed through concentrated sulphuric acid in a wash bottle. The inlet delivery tube must be below the acid and the outlet delivery tube above the acid. Figure182.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_004.jpg. This is a common drying agent but it cannot be used to dry gases which are basic. Gases like ammonia and hydrogen sulphide do react with concentrated sulphuric acid and are not dried by it. Concentrated sulphuric acid is not used to dry ammonia gas because it reacts with ammonia to form ammonium sulphate. Instead, solid desiccants like fused calcium chloride and calcium oxide/quick lime placed in a U-tube or quick lime tower respectively are used. b) Anhydrous calcium chloride/fused calcium chloride - this is calcium chloride that has been heated - The gas is passed through anhydrous calcium chloride in a U-tube. Figure183.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_005.jpg. Anhydrous calcium chloride is not used to dry ammonia gas because it reacts with the gas to form a solid complex. Gases dried through the U-tube include oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide. c) Calcium oxide/quick lime. This is a drying agent used to dry basic gases such as ammonia. Ammonia is dried in a quick lime tower as shown below. Figure184.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_006.jpg. d) Silicon (IV) oxide/silica gel. During the large-scale manufacture of oxygen, air free from Carbon dioxide is usually passed through silica gel to absorb water vapour. Like carbondioxide, water vapour solidifies on cooling, blocking the apparatus, if not removed from the air to be liquified. Silica gel is also commonly put in pampers and napkins, as a drying agent for the liquid part of human waste. Note: Dried gases must not be collected over water. Other drying agents include anhydrous magnesium sulphate, anhydrous sodium sulphate, and anhydrous calcium sulphate. Phosphorus pentaoxide is another drying agent used to dry ether. Drying liquids. Organic liquids are the only liquids that can be dried as some contain a little amount of water. The liquid can be dried by the process of fractional distillation or by use of desiccants such as fused calcium chloride, calcium oxide, magnesium sulphate etc., placed in a desiccator as shown below. Figure185.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_007.jpg. A desiccator consists of a lid, an upper chamber and a lower chamber. The substance to be dried is placed in the upper chamber and the drying agent is placed in the lower chamber. The circumference of the lid is smeared with oil or grease to make it air proof and the substance remains dry as long as it is in the desiccators. Drying solids. Solids with moisture can be dried by slight warming or by evaporating water from the solid at a temperature slightly below the melting point of the solids. Solids can also be dried by placing them in special drying apparatus (desiccators), as for liquids. Collection of gases. The following apparatus are among those used to collect gases; A gas jar, a bee-hive stand and a water trough. In the gas jar, there is air that is displaced by the gas to be collected. For this reason, the collection of a gas depends on whether the gas is heavier or lighter than air, and also if the gas is soluble or insoluble in water. a) A heavy gas can be collected by downward delivery. The gas displaces the air in the gas jar upwardly and the method is also referred to as upward displacement of air. This method is used to collect gases which are denser than air, because they would displace air from the gas jar. The gas collected is passed through a delivery tube connected to a gas jar in an upright position. This method is used to collect gases that are denser than air, required dry and soluble in water. Examples of gases collected by downward delivery (upward displacement of air) include: Carbon dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, Chlorine, Hydrogen chloride, Nitrogen dioxide and Sulphur trioxide. Figure186.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_008.jpg. b) A light gas can be collected by upward delivery. The gas collected displaces air downwardly and the method is also called downward displacement of air. This method is used to collect gases which are less dense than air, required dry and soluble in water. Examples of gases collected by upward delivery (Downward displacement of air) include; Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Carbon monoxide and Ammonia. The gas is passed through a delivery tube connected to an inverted gas jar as shown below. Figure187.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_009.jpg. c) An insoluble gas can be collected by simply trapping it over water. The gas jar is filled with water in the trough, inverted and the mouth of the jar placed over the beehive shelf. The gas displaces water downwardly from the gas jar when it is full. The method is sometimes referred to as downward displacement of water. Figure188.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_010.jpg. This method is suitable for gases that are not required dry and that are insoluble or slightly (sparingly) soluble in water e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Sulphur dioxide and chlorine are not collected over water because they react with it. Ammonia and hydrogen chloride are very soluble in water, and therefore not collected over it. d) Freezing method. The gas is liquefied by cooling it in an ice-cold freezing mixture in a U-tube e.g., nitrogen dioxide. e) Use of a gas syringe. This method collects any gas irrespective of its density or solubility (i.e., whether the gas is soluble in water or not, and whether the gas is denser than air or not). However, the method is only suitable for collecting gases produced in small quantities. Figure189.1.2.experimental_chemistry_image_011.jpg. Advantages of using syringe method: a) It is easy to know if the syringe is full of the gas or not; b) It is easy to transport the gas; c) Air does not easily mix with the gas collected, and therefore, the collected gas is almost pure; d) Collects any gas irrespective of its properties like solubility and density; e) The volume of gas collected is known, and correct volumes of gases are used. Tests for Common Gases. Oxygen: Place a glowing splint into the test-tube: The glowing splint relights. Hydrogen: Place a lighted splint at the mouth of the test-tube: The lighted splint extinguishes with a ‘pop’ sound. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively in excess oxygen to make a loud pop sound. Carbon dioxide: Bubble the gas into lime water: A white precipitate of calcium carbonate forms. Sulphur dioxide: Place a paper soaked with acidified potassium manganate (VII) at the mouth of the test-tube: The purple solution turn colourless. Chlorine: Place a damp blue litmus paper at the mouth of the test-tube: The blue litmus turns red and is then bleached white. Ammonia: Place a damp red litmus paper at the mouth of the test-tube: The red litmus turns blue. Table3.Summary_of_ gases.odt. Note: In the laboratory, the presence of water can be confirmed using either; a) Anhydrous Cobalt (II) chloride paper. Water turns the paper from blue to pink. or; b) Anhydrous copper (II) sulphate. Water turns the powder from white to blue. Relevant Equations. 1) [Why concentrated sulphuric acid and fused calcium chloride can’t be used to dry ammonia gas]. 2NH₃(g) + H₂SO₄(l) → (NH₄)₂SO₄(s).CaCl₂(s) + 4NH₃(g) → CaCl₂.4NH₃(s). 2) Acidified KMnO₄: Purple (Mn⁷⁺) to colourless (Mn²⁺). 3) Acidified K₂Cr₂O₇: Orange (Cr⁶⁺) to green (Cr³⁺). 4) Ca(OH)₂(aq) + CO₂(g) → CaCO₃(s) (White ppt) + H₂O(l). However, when excess carbon dioxide is bubbled through the solution (lime water), the white precipitates dissolve making the solution to appear clear. This is due to the formation of calcium hydrogen carbonate which is a soluble compound. CaCO₃(s) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g) → Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq). 5) CuSO₄(s) (white powder) + 5H₂O(l/g) → CuSO₄.5H₂O(s) (blue crystals). 6) CoCl₂(s) (blue solid) + 6H₂O(l/g) → CoCl₂.6H₂O(s) (pink solid). [Group Work 3] {In detail, research about the scientific method to carry out investigations}. The scientific method of carrying out Investigations and its Importance. As scientists, conducting investigations using the scientific method is crucial for addressing various challenges in our environment. This approach enables us to develop improved products and processes that minimize harm to the environment. Ensuring sustainable use of our environment is essential, as the environment provides vital resources such as food, energy, and materials. Chemists are like detectives; They thoroughly gather evidence, often driven by data, and piece together the obtained evidence to formulate theories that explain observable properties and even scientific laws. When carrying out a scientific investigation, the following steps are typically followed: Observation: The investigation begins with careful observation of a phenomenon or problem in the natural world. These observations serve as the starting point for formulating questions and hypotheses. Hypothesis Formulation: Based on the observations, a hypothesis is formulated. A hypothesis is a testable explanation or prediction that attempts to answer the question raised by the observations. For example, in an investigation to find out whether Heating Sugar Makes It Dissolve Faster in Water, The Null Hypothesis (H₀) would be: Heating sugar won't change how fast it dissolves in water; The Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) would be: Heating sugar will make it dissolve faster in water. Methodology: A methodology is developed to test the hypothesis. This includes planning and designing experiments, selecting appropriate materials and equipment, and defining procedures and protocols. Data Collection: The experiment or investigation is carried out according to the defined methodology. Data is collected through systematic observations, measurements, and recordings. Data Analysis: Once the data is collected, it is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, or relationships. Statistical analysis and other analytical techniques may be employed to interpret the data and draw meaningful conclusions. Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing involves using the results from data analysis to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or if there is not enough evidence to do so. In the example above, if the results from data analysis clearly showed that heating sugar made it dissolve faster in water, then the null hypothesis, which stated that heating sugar would not affect its rate of dissolution, would be rejected. This would support the alternative hypothesis, which proposed that heating sugar would indeed increase its rate of dissolution. Please note that you can't accept the null hypothesis, in such a case, you instead, fail to reject the null hypothesis. Theory and/or Law Development: If the hypothesis is supported by the data, it may be further developed into a theory or a law. A scientific theory in chemistry is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is based on a body of evidence and has withstood repeated testing and scrutiny. Theories provide comprehensive explanations for observed phenomena, incorporating laws, principles, and empirical data. For example, the theory of chemical bonding explains how atoms interact to form molecules and compounds, while the kinetic molecular theory describes the behavior of gases based on the motion of individual particles. A scientific law in chemistry is a concise statement or mathematical equation that describes a fundamental relationship or regularity observed in nature. Laws describe what happens under certain conditions, but they do not explain why or how it happens. For example, the law of conservation of mass states that, in a chemical reaction, mass is neither created nor destroyed. Another law, the ideal gas law, describes the behavior of ideal gases under specific conditions. In summary, theories offer comprehensive explanations based on evidence and testing, while laws describe empirical observations or relationships. Conclusion: Finally, conclusions are drawn based on the results of the investigation. These conclusions may include implications, recommendations, or areas for further research. By following these steps, scientists are able to systematically investigate phenomena, test hypotheses, and advance our understanding of the natural world. This second chapter is done. We will expand on all that we have learnt in this chapter as we progress. The scientific method of carrying out investigations will be covered in detail at university. Darling, you are welcome to the modern scientific world.
