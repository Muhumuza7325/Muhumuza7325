All matter possess energy in one form or another. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be transformed from one form to another. Some substances have energy due to movement of the particles and this is referred to as potential energy. The energy that a substance possesses due to its position or due to the arrangement of its component parts is referred to as kinetic energy. Is this all true?;
Energy is the capacity of overcoming resistance or doing work. It is a property of matter. It can do work and can be obtained from work. Chemical changes are normally accompanied by energy changes that can be recognised in many different forms such as: Light e.g., when magnesium burns in air, sound e.g., explosion of hydrogen and oxygen, electricity e.g., in a cell reaction and heat e.g., burning of fuel like charcoal and wood. Is this all true?;
During metabolism, the chemical energy of food such as carbohydrates is converted to heat energy to keep the body warm, to mechanical energy in muscles and to electrical energy in the impulses within our nerve fibres. And in some cases, a reaction may involve a mixture of several energy forms, for example, the reactions of potassium with water. Could there be a false statement?;
Due to the fact that energy can be present in many forms, it is difficult to determine the magnitude of the total energy possessed by a substance, it is easier to determine the energy changes which take place when the substance interacts with other substances. The most common form of energy change in chemical reactions is the heat/enthalpy change. Enthalpy is the amount of energy or heat content of a system. It is denoted by the symbol H. Since it is not easy to precisely determine H, we normally consider the enthalpy change of the system, indicated as ∆H. Is this all true?;
Thermochemistry is the study of heat changes that take place during a chemical reaction. There are basically two types of heat or enthalpy changes. The source of heat change in a chemical reaction is the potential energy which substances possess. Energy is released when bonds are made and energy is absorbed when bonds are broken, i.e., bond making is an endothermic process while bond breaking is an exothermic process. Is this all true?;
Energy is taken in to break bonds and energy is given out for bond forming. ∆H = Total energy absorbed for bond breaking – Total energy released for bond making. Since ∆H < 0 for an exothermic reaction, the energy released for bond making is greater than the energy absorbed for bond breaking. For an endothermic reaction where ∆H > 0, the energy absorbed for bond breaking is greater than the energy released for bond making. Is this all true?;
Reactant particles must overcome an energy barrier before they can form products. They must possess a minimum amount of energy for this to occur. The minimum energy required for reactants to form products is called the activation energy. Particles that have energy that is equal to or lesser than the activation energy will be able to react. Is this all true?;
For an exothermic reaction, the total energy of the reactants is greater than the total energy of the products. For an endothermic reaction, the total energy of the products is greater than the total energy of the reactants. The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction can be calculated as follows: ∆H = Total energy of products - Total energy of reactants. Is this all true?;
Heat energy is measured in kilojoules, KJ. The heat change in a chemical reaction, ∆H, is expressed as a negative value if heat is evolved. The SI unit for heat changes is KJmol⁻¹. C + O₂ → CO₂ ΔH = -394KJ/mol. This means that when 1 mole of carbon in a solid state is completely burnt in gaseous oxygen, it forms 1 mole of gaseous carbon dioxide with evolution of 394KJ of energy / 394KJ are evolved when 12g of carbon combines with 32g of oxygen. Could there be a false statement?;
C + 2S → CS₂ ΔH = +106KJ/mol. This means that when 1 mole of carbon reacts with 2 moles of sulphur, it forms 1 mole of carbon disulphide with absorption of 106KJ of energy / 106KJ are absorbed when 12g of carbon combines with 64g of sulphur. Is this all true?;
When a solid is heated, its particles absorb energy, leading to an increase in their kinetic energy. Melting represents an endothermic process as it necessitates the absorption of heat energy. The enthalpy of melting, or fusion, signifies the energy absorbed per mole, when a substance transitions from a solid to a liquid state. Could there be a false statement?;
Freezing corresponds to an exothermic process, releasing heat energy as the substance shifts from a liquid to a solid state. The enthalpy of freezing denotes the energy liberated per mole during this transition. A crucial relationship exists between the enthalpies of melting and freezing: ΔH freezing = -ΔH melting. This relationship underscores that the energy absorbed during melting precisely balances the energy released during freezing, assuming the transitions occur at identical temperatures and pressures. Is this all true?;
Vaporisation, is classified as an endothermic process. The enthalpy of Vaporisation represents the energy change occurring when one mole of a substance undergoes a state change from liquid to vapour. ΔH Vaporisation = Enthalpy of vapour - Enthalpy of liquid. Condensation is the reverse of Vaporisation and it is exothermic. ΔH condensation = +ΔH vaporisation. Is this all true?;
Endothermic reactions are those reactions during which heat is absorbed from the surroundings. This is detected as a drop in temperature / the temperature of the surroundings decreases. For example, if you are holding a test tube where an endothermic reaction is occurring, it will feel cold because the reaction is absorbing heat from your hand. At the end of the reaction, the heat content / enthalpy of the products is greater than that of the reactants. Thus, in such reactions, the products are at a higher energy level than the reactants and the enthalpy change/ΔH is positive. Is this all true?;
Endothermic reactions are essential for many everyday processes. Our bodies rely on them for temperature regulation. When we sweat, the evaporation absorbs heat from our skin, keeping us cool. Instant cold packs and ice packs use a similar idea. When activated, a substance inside them, like ammonium nitrate in cold packs, dissolves in water. This dissolving process absorbs heat from the surrounding area, causing a cooling effect. Could this be false?;
Dissolving certain salts in water, like sodium thiosulphate, used in photography, falls under endothermic reactions. In nature, photosynthesis, where plants capture sunlight energy, is another key example. Melting, the process of changing ice to water, and most thermal decomposition reactions (where heat triggers a breakdown of a compound) are endothermic as well. Is this all true?;
Exothermic reactions are those during which heat is liberated to the surroundings and this is detected as a rise in temperature / the temperature of the surroundings increases. For example, if you are holding a test tube where an exothermic reaction is occurring, it will feel hot because the reaction is releasing heat to your hand. At the end of the reaction, the heat content of the products is less than that of the reactants. Thus, in such reactions, the products are at a lower energy level than the reactants and the enthalpy change is negative. Could this be false?;
In the kitchen, breaking down complex molecules during cooking releases heat that cooks our meals. Similarly, burning fuels like gasoline for heating or transportation utilises exothermic combustion reactions, where the breakdown of fuel molecules releases heat to warm homes or power engines. The process of respiration involves a series of exothermic reactions that break down food molecules, releasing energy to fuel our body's functions. Is this all true?;
Fermentation, the process used to make yoghurt, cheese, and alcoholic beverages, is an exothermic reaction. As sugars are broken down by microorganisms, heat is released. Other common examples of exothermic reactions include adding concentrated sulphuric acid to little water, with caution!, reacting dilute sulphuric acid with magnesium ribbon, reacting sodium hydroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid, and burning magnesium in air. Alkaline earth metals, like lithium, sodium, and potassium, also undergo spectacular exothermic reactions. Is this all true?;
An ecosystem is a community of living organisms, along with their physical environment, interacting as a system. The flow of energy is unidirectional in nature, propelling life forward in a continuous cycle of growth, consumption, and renewal. At the heart of this intricate web lies the sun, radiating energy that kickstarts the entire system. Is this all true?;
Through the magic of photosynthesis — an endothermic reaction — plants and algae harness solar power, converting it into the life-sustaining fuel of carbohydrates. From there, the energy journey begins. Herbivores munch on these green wonders, passing on the energy as they become prey to carnivores. Omnivores, which consume both plants and animals, also play a crucial role in this energy transfer, acting as both primary and secondary consumers. Could this be false?;
Each step up the food chain, energy is transferred, sustaining the diverse array of creatures populating the ecosystem. At every transfer, a bit of energy dissipates as heat, nature's tax on efficiency, a consequence of the exothermic reactions that fuel life's processes such as respiration. Decomposers break down the remains of the fallen into simpler forms, releasing trapped energy and essential nutrients back into the environment. These nutrients then fuel the growth of new life, closing the loop of the energy cycle. Is this all true?;






23[Assignment 2] {Explain in detail the heat of reaction and interpret energy profiles of chemical reactions}. Heat of reaction. The heat of reaction for a chemical reaction is the amount of heat evolved or absorbed when molar quantities of substances react together completely. Types of heats of reactions. Heat of combustion. Fuels are substances that are burnt to release usable energy, typically in the form of heat and/or light. Fuels of organic origin are commonly used and in these combustion reactions, the chemical energy stored in the bonds of the fuel is transformed into heat and/or light energy. Fossil fuels, in particular, undergo complete combustion when there is sufficient oxygen. During complete combustion, these fuels react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, along with the release of heat and/or light, and sometimes even electricity. However, incomplete combustion can occur with insufficient oxygen, leading to the formation of undesirable products like carbon monoxide and soot. Apart from combustion of fuels of organic origin, fuel cells can also be used to release energy. One such fuel cell is a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. Unlike combustion engines reliant on heat, hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells provide a clean alternative by directly converting chemical energy to electricity through electrochemistry. Hydrogen fuel (H₂) is oxidised at the anode (2H₂(g) → 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻), releasing electrons that flow through an external circuit to generate electricity. Simultaneously, oxygen gas (O₂) from the air undergoes reduction at the cathode (O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)). Protons (H⁺) travel through a membrane to the cathode, where they combine with the electrons and oxygen to form water (H₂O). The overall reaction (2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)) is clean and efficient, but challenges like hydrogen production and infrastructure development remain for widespread adoption of this technology. Heat of combustion is the amount of heat liberated when one mole of a substance is completely burnt in oxygen. Most combustion reactions are exothermic. Some substances, however, especially those containing nitrogen or sulphur, can undergo endothermic combustion. Examples: 1) Carbon undergoes complete combustion according to the equation. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) ∆H = -393KJmol⁻¹. Calculate the amount of heat evolved when 20g of carbon is completely burnt. 12g of carbon liberate 393KJ. 20g of carbon liberate ((393x20)/12) = 655KJ. 2) Glucose burns in air according to the equation. C₆H₁₂O₆(s) + 6O₂(g) → 6CO₂(g) + 6H₂O(g) ∆H = -2802KJmol⁻¹. Calculate the amount of heat produced when 45g of glucose is completely burnt in air. Molar mass of C₆H₁₂O₆ = 12x6+1x12+16x6 = 180g. 180g of C₆H₁₂O₆ liberate 2802KJ. 45g of C₆H₁₂O₆ liberate ((2802*45)/180)KJ. = 700.5KJ. Determination of heat of combustion of ethanol. Figure325.4.4.energy_changes_during_chemical_reactions_image_003.jpg. A known mass of water (150cm³) is put in a thin metal can. Initial temperature of water is noted, t₁⁰C. The spirit lamp with a wick inserted in it is filled with some ethanol and weighed. The mass of the lamp and ethanol before burning is noted, m₁g. The lamp is lit and placed under the metal can to shield it from draughts (air currents); The whole apparatus is placed in a large tin to prevent heat loss. A wire gauge is not used as it would absorb some of the heat. Using the flame from the burning ethanol, heat the water in the can while stirring gently with the thermometer. The metal tin is heated until the highest temperature of the water is reached. This highest temperature of the water is noted, t₂⁰C. The lamp is put out immediately and reweighed with its contents to find the new mass of lamp and ethanol after burning, m₂g. Note that a tin can is often preferred because tin is a good conductor of heat and transmits most of the heat directly to the water. Treatment of results: Mass of ethanol = (m₁-m₂)g, Mass of water = 150g, Temperature rise = (t₂-t₁). Specific heat capacity of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹. Heat gained by water = mass x specific heat capacity x temperature rise = mc∆T = 150 x 4.2 x (t₂-t₁)J. Molar mass of ethanol, C₂H₅OH = 12x2+1x5+16+1 = 46g. (m₁-m₂)g of C₂H₅OH liberate 630(t₂-t₁)J. 46g of C₂H₅OH liberates (630(t₂-t₁) * 46)/(m₁-m₂)J. Note: The heat of combustion in this experiment would be lower than the theoretical value because; Heat is lost to the environment during the experiment. Some heat produced warms the metal can and air but does not pass into the water. Examples: 1) When 0.382g of ethanol was burnt, the heat liberated raised the temperature of 100g of water from 16.5⁰C to 43.5⁰C. Calculate the heat of combustion of ethanol (SHC of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, C = 12, H = 1, O = 16). Heat gained by water = mc∆T = 100x4.2x(43.5-16.5)J = 11340J = 11340/1000J = 11.34KJ. Molar mass of C₂H₅OH = 12x2+1x5+16+1 = 46g. 0.382g of C₂H₅OH liberate 11.34KJ. 46g of C₂H₅OH liberate ((11.34*46)/0.382)KJ = 1365.5KJmol⁻¹. 2) When 0.16g of methanol was burnt, the heat generated raised the temperature of 200g of water from 21⁰C to 25⁰C. Calculate the heat of combustion of methanol (SHC of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, C = 12, O = 16, H = 1). Heat gained by water = mc∆T = 200x4.2x(25-21)J = 3360J = 3.36KJmol⁻¹. Molar mass of methanol, CH₃OH = 12+1x3+16+1 = 32g. 0.16g of CH₃OH liberate 3.36KJ. 32g of CH₃OH liberate (3.3*32)/0.16 = 672KJmol⁻¹. Exercise. 1) In an experiment to determine the enthalpy of combustion of propan-1-ol (C₃H₇OH), 0.54g of propan-1-ol was burnt and the heat evolved caused the temperature of 150cm³ of water to rise by 21.5⁰C. Calculate the value of enthalpy of combustion (Ans = 1505KJmol⁻¹). 2) When 0.4g of ethanol was burnt, it raised the temperature of 0.1g of water by 20⁰C. Calculate the enthalpy of combustion by taking into consideration that the specific heat capacity of water is 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹ (Ans = 976.7KJmol⁻¹). 3) The enthalpy for the complete combustion of carbon is -393KJmol⁻¹. a) Write an equation for the complete combustion of carbon. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) ΔH = -393KJ/mol. b) 80kg of charcoal costs shs.4000. Calculate the cost of charcoal required to produce 16375KJ. From the equation; 393KJ of heat is liberated by 12g of Carbon. 16375KJ of heat is liberated by ((16375*12) ⁄ 393)g of Carbon = 500g or 0.5Kg of Carbon. 80kg of charcoal (carbon) costs shs.4000. 0.5kg of charcoal (carbon) costs ((4000*0.5)/80) = shs.25. 4) Use the following specimen results to calculate the heat of combustion of ethanol. Initial mass of ethanol lamp and ethanol before burning = 29.974g. Mass of ethanol lamp and ethanol after burning = 29.592g. Initial temperature of water = 17.7⁰C. Final temperature of water = 41.2⁰C. Volume of water in can = 100cm³. (Given, density of water = 1g/cm³, specific heat capacity of water = 4.2J/g/K, C = 12, H = 1, O = 16) [Ans = -1189KJmol⁻¹]. 5) Ethanol burns in excess air according to the equation. 2CH₃OH(l) + 3O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) ΔH = -730KJ/mol. Given that 3.2g of methanol were burnt, determine: i) The amount of heat liberated (32.5KJ). ii) The mass of carbon dioxide produced (4.4g). 6) Methane burns according to the equation below. CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). A litre of methane costs shs.600. Calculate the cost of methane required to produce 1.746 × 103KJ of heat. (1 mole of gas occupies 24 litres at RTP, heat of combustion of methane is -882KJmol⁻¹). Importance of enthalpy of combustion. The enthalpy of combustion, crucial for measuring heat released during burning, has extensive applications across various fields. In nutrition, it relates to a food's energy density, guiding dietary recommendations based on calorie needs. For fuel selection, it determines the energy content of fuels, promoting efficient energy sources like natural gas over coal. In designing explosives, it identifies materials with high positive enthalpy changes for powerful detonations. Chemical engineers use this data to optimise combustion processes and predict reaction efficiencies, enhancing industrial operations. Ecologists leverage it to study energy flow in ecosystems, understanding energy transfers between organisms and their environment. Thus, the enthalpy of combustion is vital for improving efficiency, safety, and sustainability in science and daily life. • In groups, design and carry out an investigation to compare the heat given out when different fuels burn (e.g., peanuts, oils, paper, and wood). Heat of solution. Enthalpy of solution is the amount of heat evolved or absorbed when one mole of a substance is completely dissolved in water so that further dissolution causes no further temperature changes. Enthalpy of solution can also be defined as the heat change which occurs when one mole of a solute is dissolved in a specified amount of solvent to form an infinitely dilute solution. An infinitely dilute solution is one in which further dilution does not show any heat change. Note: Enthalpy of solution can be either endothermic or exothermic. If it is exothermic, it means that the solute is not very soluble in water and would easily dissolve on heating. If it is endothermic, the solute is said to be very soluble in water e.g., sodium hydroxide, gases such as sulphur dioxide, and anhydrous copper (II) sulphate. Determination of heat of solution of Ammonium nitrate. A known volume of water (100cm³) is placed in a calorimeter/beaker and its initial temperature noted. A known mass of ammonium nitrate (4.0g) is carefully added to the water in the calorimeter/beaker with constant stirring. Stir the mixture well with a stirrer until there is no change in temperature and record the highest or lowest temperature of the solution reached. Typical results. Initial temperature of water = 18.5⁰C, Final temperature of water = 16.0⁰C, Temperature fall = 2.5⁰C, Mass of ammonium nitrate = 4.0g, Mass of water = 100g, Specific capacity of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹. Heat absorbed = mc∆T = 1050J = 1.05KJ. Molar mass of ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ = 14+1x4+14+16x3 = 80g. 4.0g of NH₄NO₃ liberate 1.05KJ. 80g of NH₄NO₃ liberate (1.05/4.0*80)KJmol⁻¹ = +21.0KJmol⁻¹. Example: 0.5g of ammonium nitrate was dissolved in 50cm³ of water. The temperature dropped from 24⁰C to 18⁰C. Calculate the enthalpy of solution of ammonium nitrate (specific heat capacity of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of water = 1gcm⁻³, N = 14, H = 1, O = 16). Heat absorbed = mc∆T = 50x4.2x(24-18) = 1260J = 1.26KJ. Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+1x4+14+16x3 = 80g. 0.5g of NH₄NO₃ liberate 1.26KJ. 80g of NH₄NO₃ liberate 1.2/0.5*80KJ = 201.6KJmol⁻¹. Exercise. 1) 1g of sodium chloride was added to 1000cm³ of water in a calorimeter. The temperature of water changed from 23⁰C to 27⁰C. Calculate the heat of solution of sodium chloride (SHC is 4.2J/g/K and density is 1g/cc) [Ans = 99.8118KJ/mol]. 2) When 10g of ammonium chloride was dissolved in 100cm³ of water, the temperature changed from 21⁰C to 19⁰C. Determine the molar heat of solution of ammonium chloride (SHC of solution = 4.2J/g/⁰C, density of water = 1g/cm³, N = 14, H = 1, Cl = 35.5). [Ans = 4.9434KJ/mol]. 3) When 16g of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate were dissolved in 150cm³ of water, the temperature changed from 24⁰C to 29⁰C. Determine the heat of solution of the anhydrous copper (II) sulphate [Ans = 34.860KJ/mol] and with a reason, state whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. Ans: The reaction is exothermic. Despite a temperature increase (possibly due to limitations in heat absorption by the solution), the positive enthalpy change confirms the endothermic nature of copper (II) sulphate dissolving in water. • In groups, research, discuss and report on: • investigations of endothermic or exothermic reactions using the scientific method of dissolving substances (e.g., sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium nitrate, etc.,) in water and noting the temperature changes in each case as the energy stored in bonds is released; • the energy transformations in burning ethanol, paraffin or wood and the change from chemical energy to heat and light. Heat of neutralisation. This is the amount of heat evolved when one mole of aqueous hydrogen ions reacts with one mole of aqueous hydroxide/hydroxyl ions to form one mole of water. H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l). The heat of neutralisation depends on the nature of the acid and the base reacted. E.g., the enthalpy change associated with the neutralisation of strong acids by strong bases typically remains relatively constant at around -57.3KJ/mol. While there might be slight variations depending on the specific acid and base or experimental conditions, this value serves as a consistent benchmark for such reactions. This is because strong acids and bases and the salt produced are completely ionised giving many free hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions which readily combine, giving a lot of heat. There is no heat required for bond breaking as the ions are already existing freely. For strong acid/weak base or weak acid/strong base or weak acid/weak base, the heat released is small (less than 57.3KJmol⁻¹) and inconsistent. This is because weak acids and bases are partially ionised giving few hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions and some heat which should have been released is used to completely ionise the weak acid and base instead, for neutralisation to occur. Determination of heat of neutralisation between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. A fixed volume, V₁ = 100cm³ of a known concentration, m₁ of hydrochloric acid is measured into a plastic beaker/vacuum flask/calorimeter and the initial temperature of the acid, T₁ is noted. Similarly, a fixed volume, V₂ = 100cm³ of a known concentration, m₂ of sodium hydroxide is measured and the initial temperature of the alkali, T₂ is noted. NaOH is carefully added into the beaker/vacuum flask/calorimeter containing HCl, stirring gently with a stirrer. T₁ and T₂ values are used to calculate the average initial temperature of the solutions, T₃. The highest temperature of the mixture, T₄ is noted. Treatment of sample results. Initial temperature of hydrochloric acid, T₁ = 21.0⁰C. Initial temperature of sodium hydroxide, T₂ = 22.0⁰C. Average temperature of solutions, T₃ = (T₁+T₂)/2 = 21.5⁰C. Final temperature of the mixture, T₄ = 34.5⁰C. Specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹. Heat evolved = mc∆T = (V₁+V₂)*c*(T₄-T₃) = 200*4.2*(34.5-21.5)J = 10920J = 10.92KJ. Moles of HCl or NaOH = 2/1000*100 = 0.2moles. 0.2moles of HCl liberate 10.92KJ. 1 mole of HCl liberates 10.92/0.2 = 54.6KJmol⁻¹ ∴ The heat of neutralisation of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide = 54.6KJmol⁻¹. This value deviates slightly from the expected -57.3KJ/mol for strong acid-strong base neutralisation, possibly due to heat loss to the surroundings or minor inaccuracies in specific heat capacity assumptions. Note that while a vacuum flask might offer some improvement over a plastic beaker, a calorimeter designed for calorimetric experiments is the most precise and efficient tool for determining the heat of neutralisation. ***To experimentally determine the maximum heat of neutralisation between HCl and NaOH, known volumes of HCl are incrementally and carefully added to a fixed volume of NaOH in the beaker/vacuum flask/calorimeter, stirring gently with a stirrer after each addition, and waiting for the temperature to stabilise. The highest temperature reached after each addition is then recorded. The highest point on a graph of temperature against volume added, corresponds to the highest temperature of the mixture, which in turn corresponds to the maximum heat produced during the neutralisation reaction. The increasing and then decreasing temperature trend observed in the HCl and NaOH neutralisation experiment, reflects the heat released during the reaction reaching a maximum at stoichiometric balance, followed by dilution effects, reducing temperature beyond this point. Note that using standard solutions with known concentrations ensures consistent results and allows for calculation of the heat of neutralisation based on the temperature change and the amount of reactants used***. Examples: 1) 1.50cm³ of 2M hydrochloric acid reacts with 50cm³ of 2M sodium hydroxide, both at 22⁰C in a plastic beaker. The mixture was stirred and its maximum temperature was 35⁰C (specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³). Calculate the enthalpy of neutralisation of sodium hydroxide. Heat gained by the solution = mc∆T = 100x4.2x(35-22)J = 5460J = 5.46KJ. Moles of NaOH = 2/1000*50 = 0.1 moles. 0.1 moles of NaOH liberate 5.46KJ. 1 mole of NaOH liberates = 54.6KJmol⁻¹. 2) When 50.0cm³ of 1.0M sulphuric acid was added to 50.0cm³ of 2M sodium hydroxide, the temperature of the resultant mixture rose by 13.6⁰C (specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³). Calculate the enthalpy of neutralisation of sodium hydroxide. Heat gained by the solution = mc∆T = 100x4.2x13.6J = 5712J = 5.712KJ. Moles of NaOH = 2/1000*50 = 0.1 moles. 0.1 moles of NaOH liberate 5.712KJ. 1 mole of NaOH liberates 5.712/0.1 = 57.12KJmol⁻¹. Exercise. 1) When 50cm³ of 0.5M hydrochloric acid was added to 50cm³ of 0.5M sodium hydroxide in a calorimeter. There was a temperature rise from 27.5 to 30.8⁰C. Calculate the heat of neutralisation (Ans = 55.44). 2) 50cm³ of sodium hydroxide of concentration 0.4M required 20cm³ of 0.5M sulphuric acid for complete neutralisation. The temperature rise was 3.4⁰C. If both solutions in the calorimeter were initially at the same temperature. Find the enthalpy of neutralisation of the reaction. (Assume the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible and SHC of water is 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹) [Ans = 62.475]. 3) 50cm³ of 2M HCl and 50cm³ of 2M NaOH both at 22⁰C where mixed in a plastic beaker. The mixture was stirred and the maximum temperature contained was 35⁰C (SHC of solution = 4.2J/g/⁰C Density of solution = 1g/cm³). a) Write the ionic equation for the reaction. b) Calculate the heat change for the reaction [5460J]. c) Calculate the heat change when 1 mole of the acid is neutralised by 1 mole of the base i.e., molar enthalpy of neutralisation [546KJ]. d) In another experiment, 50cm³ of 2M NH₄OH was used instead of the NaOH. State whether the heat of reaction was greater than, equal to or less than the value you calculated [Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base and not completely ionised, its heat of neutralisation was less than the calculated value]. 4) When 50cm³ of 0.5M HCl acid solution was added to 50cm³ of 0.5M KOH solution in a calorimeter, there was a temperature rise from 27.5⁰C to 30.8⁰C . Calculate the enthalpy of neutralisation of the reaction. (density of water = 1g/cm³ and its heat capacity is 4.2J/g/⁰C ). 5) Use the following results to calculate the heat of neutralisation of an acid. (Assume density of solution = 1g/cm³). Volume of 2M NaOH = 20cm³. Volume of 2M HCl = 20cm³. Initial temperature of HCl = 14.0⁰C. Initial temperature of NaOH = 14.4⁰C. Final temperature of the mixture = 27.2⁰C. (Answer = 54.6KJ/mol). Heat of Displacement. This is the amount of heat usually evolved, sometimes absorbed, when one mole of a substance is displaced from its compound by another substance higher than it in the electrochemical series. These reactions are normally occupied by colour changes. Determination of heat of displacement of copper. a) Measure 50cm³ of 0.2M copper (II) sulphate solution into a clean and dry calorimeter. The calorimeter should be fitted with a lid or stopper that has a hole to accommodate a thermometer. A plastic bottle fitted with a bung carrying a thermometer, could be used. Stir and record the initial temperature of the solution. Weigh 1g of iron filings, add the filings to the solution and stir well using a thermometer (crucial for accurately determining the highest temperature attained by the solution). Record the highest temperature attained by the solution. Results and calculations. Initial temperature of CuSO₄ = 21.0⁰C, Final temperature = 27.0⁰C, Rise in temperature = 6.0⁰C, Mass of 50cm³ of CuSO₄ solution = 50g. Specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹. Heat change = mc∆T = 50x4.2x6.0J = 1260J = 1.26KJ. Moles of CuSO₄ = 0.2/1000*50 = 0.01 moles. 0.01 moles of CuSO₄ liberate 1.26KJ. 1 mole of CuSO₄ liberates = -126KJmol⁻¹. The thermochemical equation for the reaction is: CuSO₄(aq) + Fe(s) → Cu(s) + FeSO₄(aq) ∆H = -126KJmol⁻¹. b) A known volume of copper (II) sulphate solution of known concentration is measured accurately using a graduated cylinder and transferred to a calorimeter. The initial temperature of the solution is recorded using a thermometer. The calorimeter is then placed in a well-insulated container to minimise heat loss. A known mass of zinc dust is weighed using an analytical balance and carefully added to the copper (II) sulphate solution in the calorimeter. The mixture is stirred constantly with a stirrer to ensure uniform mixing and temperature distribution. The temperature of the mixture is monitored and the highest temperature attained is recorded. This highest temperature corresponds to the point where the maximum heat of displacement is released. Example: 1(a) When an excess of iron filings was added to 25cm³ of 0.4M copper (II) solution, there was a temperature rise of 15⁰C. Calculate the molar enthalpy of displacement of copper (specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³). Heat change = mc∆T = 25x4.2x15 = 1575J = 1.575KJ. Moles of CuSO₄ = 0.4/1000*25 = 0.01 moles. 0.01 moles of CuSO₄ liberate 1.575KJ. 1 mole of CuSO₄ liberates 1.575/0.01 = +157.5KJmol⁻¹. (b) Write the thermochemical equation for the reaction. CuSO₄(aq) + Fe(s) → Cu(s) + FeSO₄(aq) ∆H = +157.5KJmol⁻¹. 2) To 100cm³ of 0.2M copper (II) sulphate solution in a plastic beaker was added excess zinc dust. There was a temperature change from 20⁰C to 30.4⁰C. Why was a plastic beaker used? The plastic beaker is a poor conductor of heat and minimises heat loss to the surrounding. (b) State what was observed. The blue copper (II) sulphate solution turns to colourless and a brown solid is deposited. (b) Calculate the molar heat of the reaction (specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³) [Answer = 218.4KJmol⁻¹]. (c) Write a thermochemical equation for the reaction. CuSO₄(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + ZnSO₄(aq) ∆H = + 218.4KJmol⁻¹. 3) 25cm³ of copper (II) sulphate solution of molarity 0.5M was put in a beaker and excess zinc dust (1g) was added to the solution. The initial temperature of the solution was 25⁰C and final temperature was 27⁰C. Find the heat of displacement of copper (II) sulphate [Ans = 16.8]. 4) When 6.5g of zinc powder were added to 250cm³ of 0.5M copper (II) sulphate solution in a plastic cup, 5.46KJ of heat was liberated (Cu = 65). a) Why was a plastic cup used and not a metallic cup? b) Write the ionic equation for the reaction between zinc powder and copper (II) sulphate solution. c) Calculate: i) The number of moles of zinc in 6.5g of zinc powder [0.125]. ii) The number of moles of zinc that reacted with copper (II) sulphate solution [0.125]. iii) The heat energy produced when 1 mole of zinc reacts with 1 mole of copper (II) sulphate (enthalpy of displacement) [43.6KJ/mol]. Heat of formation. The heat of formation, also known as the standard enthalpy of formation, is the change in enthalpy that occurs when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states at a specified temperature (usually 25°C or 298K) and pressure (usually 1atm). The standard state of an element is its most stable form at the specified temperature and pressure. For example: H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) → H₂O(l) ΔH Formation = -286KJ/mol. 286JK of heat is evolved when one mole of water is formed from 1 mole of gaseous hydrogen and ½ a mole of gaseous oxygen. Exercise. 1) From the equation: 4Al(s) + 3O₂(g) → 2Al₂O₃(s) ΔH Formation = -3360KJ/mol. a) Calculate the enthalpy of formation of aluminium oxide (answer = -1680KJ/mol). b) Determine the amount of heat produced when 10.2g of aluminium oxide is formed from its elements in their standard states [168KJ]. c) What volume of oxygen will be required for the formation of aluminium oxide at room temperature? (Al = 27, O = 16, 1 mole of a gas at STP occupies 24000cm³) [72000cm³]. The energy Level Diagram/Profile. An energy level diagram/profile shows both the enthalpy change and activation energy of a reaction. For an exothermic reaction, the total energy of the reactants is higher than the total energy of the products and the activation energy needed is low.
