LECTURE NOTES (Student’s Reader Three) POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGIES FACULTY OF ECONOMICS, ENERGY AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCE DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED ECONOMICS MAKERERE UNIVERSITY BUSINESS SCHOOL March, 2025 Facilitator: Darious Mugabe	Email:	 Note that these notes are guides but NOT a substitute for attending lectures. Clearly, the notes in this reader are far from being complete and CANNOT substitute reading full text books or the recommended texts. Introduction The objective of this reader is to provide a general view of how poverty is measured. Without aiming to cover all options, some of the most well-known methods for measuring poverty are covered herein, focusing in greater depth on those that are normally used within the context of official statistics. It is important to note that the methods for developing poverty measures presented, very often, use household surveys as the source of data, in particular the surveys on expenditure and income. This reader also provides an overview of the main economic theories relating to the causes of and responses to poverty which are relevant to Uganda. However, in order to effectively analyse economic causes and propose potential solutions to the problem, we need first to define what poverty is. Definition Poverty has no universally accepted definition. From a social researcher's point of view, poverty is a complex phenomenon influenced by a large number of factors and which can be studied from many different perspectives. The study and interpretation of poverty isn't a simple task, as there are as many ways of measuring poverty as there are ways of defining it. Adam Smith, who is considered the father of modern economics, defined poverty as "the inability to purchase necessities required by nature or custom" (Smith, 1776). Smith, further elaborated on this definition by clarifying the type of necessities required to be considered non-poor. He thus wrote "….by necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without" (Smith, 1776, pp. 870-871). Hence this mixes an absolute measure (necessities required by nature) with aspects of a relative measure (necessities required by custom) which disqualifies it from being a working definition. We need a working definition!: poverty can be defined as a situation of failure to attain a given standard of living (SoL) or lack of resources to acquire the basic needs of life i.e. failure of an individual or household to attain a given minimum acceptable SoL. Important to note is that the definition of poverty and the policies addressing it are all shaped by political biases and values. As a result, there are disparities of status and interests that make poverty an inescapably political act. Over time, poverty has been taken to be an exercise of power by the “educated elite” to categorize, stigmatize, but above all to neutralize the poor and disadvantaged through analysis that obscures the political nature of social and economic inequality. Indeed, political agendas worldwide are the overriding factors in poverty that not only influence the choice of the theory of poverty but the very definition of poverty to be explained by each theory. Therefore, poverty is multidimensional but in its general sense, it means lack of necessities. Basic food, shelter, medical care, and safety are generally thought as “necessities” based on shared values of human dignity. However, in practice what is a necessity to one person is not uniformly a necessity to all others. Thus, there are many dimensions that feature prominently in the definition of poverty. They include the following: Poverty consists of many interlocked things. Although poverty is rarely about the lack of only one thing, the bottom line is always hunger i.e. the lack of food. Poverty has important psychological dimensions, such as powerlessness, voicelessness, dependency, shame, and humiliation. However, the maintenance of cultural identity and social norms of solidarity often helps poor people to continue to believe in their own humanity, despite inhumane conditions. Poor people lack access to basic infrastructure — roads (particularly in rural areas), transportation, and clean water. While there is a widespread thirst for literacy, schooling receives little mention or mixed reviews from the poor (they have little education). Poor people realize that education offers an escape from poverty but only if the economic environment in the society at large and the quality of education improve. Poor health and illness are dreaded almost everywhere as a source of destitution among the poor. This is related to the costs of health care as well as to income lost due to illness. The poor rarely speak of income, but focus instead on managing assets — physical, human, social, and environmental — as a way to cope with their vulnerability. In many areas, this vulnerability has a gender dimension. Why does poverty matter? Intrinsic significance: poverty is bad in itself Functional reasons: poverty has implications for development, e.g. poverty traps For many, removal of poverty is one of the main goals of economic development [UN (SDG No.1), Sachs (End of Poverty, 2005)] Working Concepts of Poverty Poverty Line: this is a critical threshold of income/consumption or cutoff point below which a person is declared poor. It represents the minimum level of acceptable economic participation at a given point in time. According to the World Bank, the international poverty line in developing countries is $1.9 a day (approximately 6,000 shillings). The poverty line keeps changing from time to time Transitory Vs Chronic Poverty: Transitory or transient or temporary poverty results from bad economic shocks such as drought, inflation, lower producer prices leading to short term fall below the poverty line. Chronic Poverty, on the other hand, is a recurring condition or state of being where a person is deprived of basic needs of life, such as food, shelter, and clothing, among others. Absolute Vs Relative Poverty: Absolute poverty is where a household or society is surviving at the margin. It is characterized by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease and general sense of malaise or hopelessness. Relative poverty, on the other hand is comparative—it compares poverty between individuals, societies, nations or regions. It is a standard which is measured in terms of the society in which an individual lives and which therefore differs between countries and over time Poverty trap: A state where poverty tends to persist due to "self-reinforcing mechanisms" such as undernourishment, lack of access to insurance, population growth, a degraded environment and economic growth. Multi-dimensional deprivation (severe poverty):- This is deprivation or the lack of access to certain goods and services considered necessary for society, whether basic need or not. Theories of Poverty Traditional Theories Initially, poverty was conceived to be “God-given” i.e. part of natural order of things. That God created some people to be poor. In the Victorian times (19th-20th century), the treatment of poverty by the classical and neoclassical schools of thought, or the so-called "orthodox" approaches initiated the formal analysis of poverty. It began to be conceived as an individualistic problem, caused by laziness, thriftless-ness, and lack of initiative. Surprisingly, the principles and assumptions on which the classical and neoclassical schools of economics rest are nowadays the most strongly affirmed in the economics profession, having gained over time the labels "conventional", "mainstream" or even "orthodox”. The assessments and analyses of poverty performed in general by economists have, by and large, been approached mainly from the classical or neoclassical perspective. Classical Theory of Poverty Classical theory typically assumes that the outcomes of the exchanges taking place in the marketplace are efficient, and hence wages faithfully reflect individual productivity. To the proponents of this theory, poverty is mainly seen as a consequence of poor individual choices (e.g. the poor lack “self-control”) that affect productivity negatively, although it is also acknowledged that pure differences in underlying genetic abilities are also potential causes of poverty. That the "wrong" choices made by individuals may lead them to find themselves in a "poverty or welfare trap". Beyond a minimum level to prevent destitution, state intervention is generally viewed adversely as a source of economic inefficiency; by generating incentives that are misaligned between poor individuals and society as a whole. Welfare programs are perceived as a potential cause for or reinforcement of poverty (through welfare dependence). A large majority of the policy prescriptions under this view focuses on efforts to raise the productivity of deprived individuals in order for them to join the labour force as soon as possible (although it is acknowledged that some individuals – the young, the sick, the old - cannot participate and will need alternative support). Culture of Poverty Theory Proponents of this theory, notably American anthropologist Oscar Lewis, argue that the poor are poor because they have different values and ways of life from the rest of the society which impedes them from getting out of poverty. They further argue that the poor people’s behavioral preferences are passed on across generations within dynastic families, due either to a genetic component or upbringing. Hence the rhetoric, "poverty begets poverty" as children growing up in dysfunctional families feed from the deviant behavior of their progenitors, who act as role models (Blank, 2010) Recent contributions arising from this perspective assert that the transmission of attitudes relating to poverty can be perpetuated via a persisting "culture of poverty" which may help poor families cope with low economic means. Lewis asserted that the poorest sections of society tend to form a special sub-group with distinctive traits that are largely self- perpetuating. He thus stated that "poverty, in short, is a way of life, remarkably stable and persistent, passed down from generation to generation along family lines" (Lewis, 1965) Neo-Classical Theory of Poverty This theory was advanced by neoclassical economist Alfred Marshal. Building on the classical tradition, neoclassical theory stresses the role of the unequal initial endowments of talents, skills and capital which determine productivity of an individual in generating poverty, within a market-based competitive economic system. Proponents of this theory argue that market failures such as externalities, moral hazard and adverse selection as well as incomplete information are also viewed as aggravators of poverty (Davis, 2007) Proponents argue that market failures create uncertainty which may play a major role in causing poverty because the poor are more vulnerable to shocks to their well-being (e.g. recessions, sickness, family breakdown, etc.) Liberal Theory of Poverty (Keynesian) Liberal theory revolves around the idea that not only market distortions, but also broad underdevelopment in its multiple facets cause poverty. The most prominent pioneer of liberal economics, John. M. Keynes, believed that market forces can promote economic development, which was in turn perceived to be the single most important tool against poverty just as the neoclassical Alfred Marshal. 1 By, for instance, having lower expectations on what can be achieved in life. See (Jung & Smith, 2007) In a Keynesian/liberal perspective, poverty is mainly explained by "the misfortune of certain minorities who fall out of work, cannot work or are not expected to, although they wish to do so”. It therefore follows that the state needs to act to “regulate, supplement and exhort, but not impose” in order to end poverty From the set of macroeconomic variables, however, modern economists (new-Keynesians) stress that poverty is a result of lack of factor inputs such as land, capital, skills, etc. needed in generating the type of growth that permits poverty relief. If the entrepreneurial investment is low, this, in turn, raises unemployment and poverty rates among suppliers of labour. It is thus suggested that government revenue, raised via taxes or bond issue, should be funneled to public investment to create employment. This was viewed, in Keynes’ own words, as the “socialization of investment” (Jung & Smith, 2007) Other theories include the Merxist/radical theories and the social exclusion and eclectic theories. You can explore them in your reading time. Popular Hypotheses of Poverty In an attempt to explain the variations in the levels of development between countries, economists have advanced several hypotheses. The most popular ones include The Geography Hypothesis Proponents of this hypothesis, notably 18th Century French philosopher Montesquieu, economist Jeffrey Sachs, Jared Diamond and others, are of a view that the physical geography of a society or country or region may perpetuate poverty. This hypothesis claims that poor societies lie between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and that rich ones lie in temperate latitudes Proponents of Geography hypothesis further argue that SSA geographic conditions—its low population densities before the 20th century, high prevalence of disease, lack of navigable rivers for transportation, meager productivity of rain-fed agriculture, and shortage of coal, among others— impeded the formation of centralized states, urbanization, and economic growth. Sachs (2013) argues that it is the transport problems of SSA, along with ecological and resource related weaknesses, which made Africa vulnerable to invasion and conquest by Europe in the late 19th century (after the Europeans learned to protect themselves against malaria with quinine), and they still hamper development in some parts of the continent today. The proponents of this hypothesis further claim that people in tropical climate tend to be lazy and lack inquisitiveness. They don’t work hard and are not innovative – the very reason they are poor. And that these lazy people tend to be ruled by despots, hence the dictatorship we 2 For more details, see Philip.E. Davis and Sanchez-Martinez. M. (2014). A review of the economic theories of poverty, National Institute of Economic and Social Research. see among poor societies. In his award-wining book “Guns, Germs & Steel” (1997), Jared Diamond contends that a country’s wealth and success depends on its geographic environment and topography. That, certain environments are easier to manipulate than others. And that a country’s climate, location, flora, fauna and terrain affect the ability of its people to provide food for consumption and for export. Diamond, thus, argues that highly productive civilizations arose in latitudes that were able to take advantage of the best crops and livestock. They developed complex civilizations because they were able to escape the day- to-day struggle for survival that characterizes life in places where crops are less nutritious and animal power is not readily available. How does Geography perpetuate poverty? Proponents of this hypothesis argue that geography perpetuates poverty through three major channels: Terrain: Regions far from the sea, such as the landlocked countries of South America, Africa, and Asia, tend to be considerably poorer than their coastal counterparts. Paul Collier, an Oxford University and former World Bank economist, in his book “Africa: Geography and Growth” classified countries in 3 groups. (a) countries which are resource- poor but have coastline; (b) countries that are resource-poor and landlocked; and (c) countries which are resource rich and where it doesn’t matter whether the country is landlocked or has a coastline. He found that coastal resource-poor countries performed significantly better than their resource-rich counterparts (whether landlocked or coastal). Landlocked, resource-scarce economies were the worst performers. Poor terrain also leads to high transportation costs. Sachs (2013) gives the example of Bolivia vs Vietnam. Although Bolivians enjoyed greater political and civil rights than the Vietnamese did, Bolivia’s economy grew slowly whereas Vietnam’s attracted foreign investment like a magnet. Why? Bolivia is a landlocked mountainous country, whereas Vietnam has a vast coastline with deep water ports conveniently located near Asia’s booming industrial economies. It’s not surprising, therefore, that Vietnam, not Bolivia, was the desirable place to assemble television sets and consumer appliances for Japanese and South Korean companies. Climate: An area’s climate can also perpetuate poverty. Societies in tropical climate zones generally face higher rates of infectious diseases and lower agricultural productivity (especially for staple foods) than do nations in temperate zones. SSA is seen as the poster child of unfortunate climate with malaria, river blindness, and more contemporary maladies like AIDS, Ebola, undermining the region’s capacity for advancement. Similar burdens apply to the desert zones. Climate has an impact on agricultural productivity, on human effort, and on diseases. For example, malaria alone profoundly perpetuates poverty in SSA. According to the WHO, 300 million to 500 million new cases of malaria occur every year, almost entirely concentrated in the tropics and mostly in sub-Saharan Africa This typically implies more than 1 week of incapacitation every year! Malaria also has long term effects such as brain damage, learning disabilities, and anemia. Natural resources: They are considered a key source of growth in many countries. But many countries with abundant resources have stagnated in poverty, for example, Nigeria, DRC, Angola etc. This is mainly on the account of what economists refer to as “resource curse”— that natural resources tend to breed overconsumption, bad governments, and the Dutch disease (increase in exploitation of natural resources and a decline in other sectors notably manufacturing or agriculture, as the case was in the Netherlands after the discovery of natural gas in 1959) all of which perpetuate poverty. Sachs & Warne (2001) argue that one of the surprising features of modern economic growth is that economies with abundant natural resources, largely in poverty, have tended to grow slower than economies without substantial natural resources. The Institutions Hypothesis Institutions are defined as the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction (North, 1990). Institutions can be formal like laws, constitutions, property rights, and contracts. They can also be informal such as “social capital”. Institutions can be (i) developmental or (ii) predatory. They are developmental when they encourage investment, growth and productivity. They are predatory when they are extractive, favoring the few. Proponents of the institutions hypothesis argue that countries which protect property rights of their citizens and remove political obstacles to economic initiative, perform better than countries that do not. So, South Korea is more prosperous than North Korea, United States is richer than Mexico, and Botswana is more advanced than Uganda. In their book “Why Nations Fail”, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson (2012) suggest that poverty is perpetuated through a single factor—a country’s political institutions. Specifically, they argue that development depends on the existence of “inclusive political institutions” They define these institutions as pluralistic systems that protect individual rights. These, in turn, give rise to inclusive economic institutions, which secure private property and encourage entrepreneurship. The long-term result is higher incomes and improved human welfare. They also argue that poverty thrives under “extractive political institutions”. In contrast, these place power in the hands of a few, and result in extractive economic institutions, which feature unfair regulations and high barriers to entry into markets. They are designed to enrich a small elite, and thus inhibit economic progress for everyone else. The broad hypothesis of the Institutions Hypothesis is that governments that protect property rights and represent their people preside over economic development, whereas those that do not suffer from poverty. The Culture Hypothesis The idea that culture perpetuates poverty goes back to German sociologist Max Weber who, in his classical work “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism” (1905), argued that the protestant ethic was a very powerful force behind the development of capitalism in its early phases, facilitating the rise of modern societies in Western Europe. Economists have done research that provides both theoretical and empirical evidence showing that countries with a more individualist culture have more innovation, a higher level of total factor productivity and higher long-run growth than countries with a more collectivist culture. Gorodnichenko & Roland (2010) provide the main tenets of the theoretical formulation of the culture hypothesis as: Individualism emphasises personal freedom and achievement and therefore individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations, or great artistic achievements. Collectivism encourages conformity and discourages individuals from standing out. Individualism makes collective action more difficult than collectivism as individuals pursue their own interest without internalising collective interests. In short, individualism better encourages innovation and thus faster growth. Intuitively, people in an individualist culture have not only a monetary reward from innovation but also a social status reward. They are therefore willing, all other things being equal, to allocate more effort to innovative activities. Proponents of this hypothesis also claim that Africans are poor because they lack a good work ethic, believe in witchcraft and magic, or resist new western technologies. And that Africa and Latin America will never be rich because their people are intrinsically profligate (wasteful) and impecunious (having little money), and because they suffer from some *manana* culture (believing in indefinite future) (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012). They also cite language, arguing that English speaking societies are more prosperous and more “civilized”. However, the English legacy has a mixed record: Canada & the US were English colonies that became prosperous by adopting that common and civilized language, but so were Nigeria, Sierra Leone or Uganda that have remained poor. Moyo (2009) reveals that there is a view that Africans are culturally, mentally, and physically innately different. That somehow deeply embedded in their psyche is an inability to embrace development and improve their own lot life without foreign guidance and help. However, since understanding the effects of culture on economic performance is a task that the economics profession is only beginning to understand, proponents of this hypothesis advise caution when drawing policy conclusions from the hypothesis. They argue that since countries inherit their culture over a long historical period, it would be vain, and probably destructive, to try to impose cultural change on countries. Countries need to embrace their cultural heritage and find institutions appropriate to this heritage. The Ignorance Hypothesis This hypothesis asserts that poverty exists in particular regions or countries simply because their rulers do not know how to make their countries rich. This is the idea held by most economists. They cite market failures as one feature of ignorance – that policymakers in poor countries don’t know how to get rid of them and heed wrong advice. For example, Banerjees (2012) holds the argument that the Liberian dictator Samuel Doe’s economic policies were disastrous because he did not even understand what was involved in being president. Proponents of this hypothesis claim that rich countries are rich because they have figured out better policies and have successfully eliminated market failures. Critics of this hypothesis have argued that it is politics that causes policy disaster and not ignorance - that leaders choose growth-retarding policies not because they are ignorant but for political reasons. And that if ignorance was the problem, well-meaning leaders would quickly learn what types of policies increased their citizens misery and abandon them in favour of those that increase their incomes and welfare. Politics often drive leaders to choose bad policies in order to buy political support and sustain their undemocratic regimes. For example, Nkrumah in Ghana at independence chose policies focusing on developing state industry which turned out to be a disaster, not because he was ignorant but because he wanted to buy political support. Generally, Africa is poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty. They get it wrong not by mistake or ignorance but on purpose i.e., for political reasons. They embrace the extractive institutions they inherited from colonial governments leading to a manifestation of the iron law of oligarchy (extractive, corrupt and repressive regimes). Other considerations Other considerations in explaining differences in development levels of countries include: Ethnicity: There are roughly 1000 tribes across sub-Saharan Africa, most with their own distinct language and customs. Nigeria alone, with 150 million people, has 400 tribes; Uganda with 42 million people, has 56 tribes as adopted in the 1995 constitution (amended in 2005); Botswana, with just over 1 million people, has 8 tribes! (Moyo, 2009). So, Proponents of this hypothesis argue that countries with fewer ethnic groups (like Botswana) outperform countries with many ethnic groups (like Uganda). They argue that ethnicity breeds civil war which in turn perpetuates poverty. Collier (2006), in purely financial terms, estimates that the typical civil war costs around 4 times the annual GDP of a country. Even in the times of peace, ethnic heterogeneity can impede growth and development. Collier postulates that the difficulty of reform in ethnically diverse small countries is due to distrust between disparate groups making collective action for public service provision difficult. Y International characteristics of global capitalism Here poverty is seen as a product of the international system. This was the perspective of those sympathetic to Marxism. It was the mantra of the dependency theorists in the 1970s and 1980s whose views lost luster when the newly industrialised countries of Southeast Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia) experienced rapid economic growth beginning in the 1960s. However, today some of these theorists blame globalization for having caused a myriad of social bads in the developing world such as the so-called “race to the bottom” in labour and environmental standards as poor countries fight for capital as well as instability wrought by hot money flows in and out of countries on a moment’s notice. 










Measures of Poverty The most important reason for measuring poverty is probably not the need for a single number for some place and date, but rather to make a poverty comparison. This is an assessment of which of two situations has more poverty. Poverty comparisons may be either qualitative or quantitative. Examples of questions which only call for qualitative poverty comparisons are: Has poverty increased or decreased over time? Is it higher or lower in one place than another? Is there more poverty with or without some policy change? Quantitative poverty comparisons, on the other hand, call for information on how much difference there is in the amount of poverty. Saying that poverty "exists" is only the first step. For many purposes, including policy analysis, one must also say "how much" poverty exists? (Ravallion, 1992). The key questions for an applied economist to answer before measuring poverty are: How do we assess individual well-being or "welfare"? At what level of measured well-being do we say that a person is poor or not? How do we aggregate individual indicators of well-being into a measure of poverty? The first two questions are sometimes referred to as the "identification problem" (which individuals are poor, and how poor are they?) while the third is called the "aggregation problem" (how much poverty is there?) In a bid to address these questions, a number of measurement approaches have been advanced which include the following: Income-based Approaches Headcount Ratio (HCR): By far the most widely-used measure is the headcount ratio which simply measures the proportion of the population that is counted as poor or a proportion of the population below the poverty line. Formally, HCR = 𝒏 *100% 𝑵 Where; n is the number of people below the poverty line N is the total population in a society or country Example; If 60 people are poor in a survey that samples 300 people, then HCR = 60 300 * 100% =0.2 * 100 % = 20%. Advantage: HCR is popular because it is easy to understand and measure. Limitation: HCR does not indicate how poor the poor are. It only measures the incidence of poverty but doesn’t take into account the intensity of poverty. Poverty Gap Ratio (PGR) PGR measures the extent to which individuals fall below the poverty line (the poverty gaps) as a proportion of the poverty line. This is the ratio of the average income or expenditure needed to get all the poor to poverty line or mean income. It takes into account the extent or intensity of poverty i.e. how poor are the poor (example will be done from class). PGR = 𝟏 ∑ 𝒑−𝒚𝒊 *100% 𝑵	𝒑 Where; ∑ is summation, p is the poverty line y is individual income /consumption of the poor N is number of people in the sample Advantage: PGR takes into account of intensity or extent of poverty Limitation: It doesn’t measure severity of poverty. Some people find it helpful to think of this measure as the cost of eliminating poverty (relative to the poverty line) is less. This is because it shows how much that is needed to be transferred to the poor to bring their incomes or expenditures up to the poverty line (as a proportion of the poverty line). The minimum cost of eliminating poverty using targeted transfers is simply the sum of all the poverty gaps in a population; every gap is filled up to the poverty line. However this interpretation is only reasonable if the transfers could be made perfectly efficient, for instance with lump sum transfers, which is implausible. The sum of all the poverty gaps is called Total Poverty Gap (TGP) or Poverty Gap Index (PGI) and it can also be formally expressed as below:. Figure1022.Reader_Three_2025_image_002.jpg. Where, H is the Poverty Head count, 𝒀𝑷 is the poverty line and 𝒀𝒊 is the poor person’s income. Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI) or “Poverty Severity Index” To construct a measure of poverty that takes into account inequality among the poor, some researchers use the squared poverty gap index. This is simply a weighted sum of poverty gaps (as a proportion of the poverty line), where the weights are the proportionate poverty gaps. Figure1023.Reader_Three_2025_image_003.jpg. themselves. It averages the squares of poverty gaps relative to the poverty line. It is one of the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) class of poverty measures that may be written as: Where; N is the size of the sample, Z is the poverty line, G is the poverty gap and a is parameter; When parameter α=0, 𝑃𝑎 is simply the head-count index. When α=1, 𝑃𝑎 is the poverty gap index, and when α is set equal to 2, 𝑃𝑎 is the poverty severity index. Therefore, from the FGT equation, we get the following; 𝑵	𝟎 𝑯𝑪𝑰 = 𝟏 ∑ (𝒑 − 𝒚𝒊) − − − − − − − 𝒊𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒕𝒚 𝑵	𝒑 𝒊=𝟏 𝑵	𝟏 𝑷𝑮𝑰 = 𝟏 ∑ (𝒑 − 𝒚𝒊) − − − − − − − 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒐𝒗𝒓𝒕𝒚 𝑵	𝒑 𝒊=𝟏 𝑵	𝟐 𝑺𝑷𝑮𝑰 = 𝟏 ∑ (𝒑 − 𝒚𝒊) − − − − − − − 𝒔𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒐𝒗𝒓𝒕𝒚 𝑵	𝒑 𝒊=𝟏 We shall do examples from class Limitations of SPGI:  One problem with this measure is that it ignores the variations in expenditure (the distribution of income and spending) amongst the poor, since the gap is an average.  Although the FGT measure provides an elegant unifying framework for measures of poverty, it leaves the unanswered question of what is the best value of α. In response to these shortfalls, economics experts have proposed alternative measures such as the Sen Index (𝑷𝑺) [which seeks to incorporate the effects of the number of poor, the depth of their poverty, and the distribution of poverty within the population]; the Sen-Shorrocks-Thon Index (𝑷𝑺𝑺𝑻) [which can be decomposed into its constitutive elements such as poverty gap index as well as Gini coefficient]; and the Watts Index (WI) [which is the average difference between the logarithm of the poverty line and the logarithm of incomes]. Food Ratio This is the ratio of expenditure on food to the total expenditure. It is formally expressed as; 𝐹𝑅 = 𝐹𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 The higher the FR, the higher the poverty. The implication is that the poor tend to spend more on food. Expenditure- based measure This looks at the total household expenditure in a month. Questionnaires are used to collect data upon which poverty is derived. Once data is obtained, it thus follows that the lower the expenditure, the higher the poverty. Decomposed Poverty Index (DPI) This looks at who is contributing more to the poverty in household. Income based Poverty Index This looks at the total income received by households. However, it is difficult to estimate people’s income. Non-Income Approaches Anthropometric measures (Medical-based measures) Anthropometricians (people who study anthropometrics or auxology) combine three basic anthropometric variables i.e. size, weight and age to create the three fundamental anthropometric indexes which are widely used in the nutritional evaluation of a developing individual (Rodrigo, 2009) The height-for-age (H/A) index: Anthropometricians assert that people who are too short for their age or too tall for their age are poor The weight-for-height (W/H) index: Anthropometricians also assert that people who are too short but heavy or too tall but light are poor. That such people have a nutrition deficiency which medical experts attribute to poverty. The weight-for-age (W/A) index: Anthropometricians assert that a child’s weight should increase with age. If constant or declining, then there is a nutrition deficiency problem which medical experts attribute to poverty. That if a child is too old but light or too young but heavy, there is poverty. In fact the Time Magazine summarized the position of scholars studying anthropometrics or auxology that: “The evidence of auxologists – who cross the disciplines of economic history, pediatrics, biology and sociology – is that average height reflects how well, or badly, a population is doing - its diet, wealth, disease and stress - and is a far better measure of a nation's standard of living than such conventional indicators as gross national product or per capita income” (Hansen & Grubb, 2016) The existence of a positive correlation between change in height and change in historical real incomes has enabled the use of change in average height as a proxy for economic growth and decline. However, the correlation is not universal. In some historical circumstances, average height fell when real income rose. We therefore need to be very careful when examining the relationship between anthropometric measures and economic well-being. Nutrition indicators This looks at household nutrition per day. The World Health Organization, for example, requires an adult man working in subsistence agriculture to consume at least 3000 calories of food per day. So, food poverty line is set at the cost of meeting that requirement. Women and children require fewer calories compared to men. Source: WHO & FAO Note: In consideration of our poverty, the cheapest way to get the 3,000 calories is a mixture of beans and rice (or any legumes and cereal grains). While eating food, you should take into consideration of nutrition, food preferences, availability of diverse food choices and eating habits. Bottom-line: Don’t eat “fwaaaaaa! ! ” Basic needs measure This uses the basic needs of life. For example, poor housing, failure to attain health services, malnutrition etc. are all signs or indicators of poverty. Possession Score Index This looks at the total number of assets a household possesses. Usually the poverty line is set at certain weights in terms of points. Assets such as land, cows, cars, houses etc. are each given points which are accumulated to obtain the possession score index. Note: There is no universally accepted measure of poverty. Therefore, a number of different approaches exist which help national practitioners specify poverty indicators that match their specific situation. 3 A calorie is a unit used in measuring the amount of energy that food provides when eaten and digested In addition to the above mentioned standard measures of poverty, efforts have been made to develop new tools that can take into account different aspects of human deprivation. Such tools include the human poverty index (HPI), gender-related development index, multidimensional poverty index, at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion indicator, global hunger index, etc. The Vicious Circle of Poverty (VCP) According to the VCP hypothesis, the poverty of each generation creates the poverty of succeeding generations. Its proponents argue that poverty is a total condition in which all sorts of factors are linked, creating a “chain” which is difficult to break; or else that the poor have themselves to blame for their predicament. The VCP occurs mostly in developing countries where there is mainly a subsistence or traditional economy. The VCP revolves around low output which results into low income and thus poverty There are four main four main factors contributing to the VCP:  Low domestic production and consumption, since there is no surplus or extra output left over from the subsistence way of living which results in small market economy. This means low output and low income and the cycle begins again.  Low capital accumulation, which means low savings, low investment, low output, and low income. The cycle starts again  Government services. As people have little income, they cannot contribute to taxes hence low taxation revenue. So government is unable to build infrastructure such as electricity transmission lines, roads, hospitals, and other basic social services. This leads to low productivity and the economy can be seen as stagnant resulting in low output and low wages. The cycle starts again.  Overseas trade. Since the subsistence economy does not provide surpluses, there will be no exports. The country will not earn enough money to purchase imports. So, people cannot buy what they need since they have low incomes and this results in low output. The cycle starts again As a result of the above factors, slowly but surely, the country begins to starve in the vicious circle of poverty. Implication of the VCP By implication, the only way to get out of the circle/cycle of poverty is through external intervention, say, education. Left to themselves, the poor cannot get out of poverty; they are trapped in the cycle. Reformists argue that the “well-off” have a moral, religious, or human obligation to make such an intervention. Criticism Critics of this view, especially mainstream economists, argue that the exogenous (external) interventions by the “well-off”—such as use of handouts—aiming to improve the poor’s capacity to produce or ability to break through the cycle, might actually have the effect of making the poor’s problems worse, not better. They argue that the poor must, themselves, show the will to revolt against poverty and improve their lives, through becoming politically aware, getting integrated into the market economy, and taking charge of their own destiny. Time taken to exit poverty It is useful to show how long it would take for an average poor person to exit poverty at different potential economic growth rates when thinking about poverty alleviation strategies. For the 𝑗𝑡ℎ person below the poverty line, the expected time to exit poverty i.e. to reach the poverty line, if consumption grows at a positive rate, g, per year is: 𝒕𝒋 = 𝒍𝒏(𝒑)−𝒍𝒏 (𝒙𝒋) Where; 𝒈	𝒈 p = poverty line 𝒙𝒋 = consumption of the poor g = growth rate of consumption Note:  Empirical evidence shows that the expected time to exit poverty for those people who are so poor (i.e. those that are below the food poverty line and cannot even afford enough food, even if they were to devote all their consumption spending to food) and with continuous annual growth rate of over 3%, is 15 years and above.  Despite potency of economic growth, it usually takes more than just growth to rapidly improve the lives of the very poor.  To accelerate poverty alleviation, targeted programs are needed to deliver benefits to the poor, in form of improvements in their human and physical assets and through interventions such as infrastructure, markets, etc. that improve returns they get from those assets. General Causes of Poverty Poverty has multiple and complex causes. (SIDA, 2005) views these multi-dimensional causes as stemming from a lack of information, knowledge about market prices for the goods they deal in, issues related to health, availability of public services, and their rights. That the poor belong to a political minority which lacks the visibility and voice as regards the institutions that shape their lives. Poor people are also said to lack access to relevant skills and knowledge, education and personal development that could improve their livelihoods But more generally, poverty may be exacerbated or caused by the following factors (we shall discuss them in class)  Lack of or limited access to economic productive assets e.g. land, capital etc. 4 SIDA (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) is a government agency working behalf of Swedish government and parliament with the mission to end poverty in the world. See (accessed on 29th September, 2021 at 10:20 AM)  Low capacities through lack of education, vocational skills, entrepreneurial abilities, poor health and poor quality of life  Vulnerability and risk—disability, climate changes, economic shocks etc.  Limited integration in the market economy and the inability of the national economy to optimize benefits within the global system.  Lack of information which makes the poor lack capacity to influence social processes, public policy choices and resource allocations.  Having large families headed by a widow or the elderly  Inadequate environmental protection measures.  Habits based upon superstition and myths giving rise to anti-social behaviour.  Other factors leading to vulnerability and exclusion Is poverty entirely bad? Some economists have reflected on the functions of poverty, arguing that the mainstream (orthodox) economic theorists over-concentrate on the “costs” of poverty and fail to identify the corresponding “functions”. The following functions have been identified: Functions of poverty Poverty helps to ensure that dirty, dangerous, boring and undignified work gets done The poor subsidize the affluent by saving them money (for example domestic servants, medical guinea pigs, and the poor paying regressive taxes) Poverty creates jobs in a number of professions (e.g. drug peddlers, prostitutes, pawnshops, army, police, etc.). The poor buy shoddy, stale and damaged goods (e.g. day-old bread, vegetables, and second-hand clothes) which prolongs the economic usefulness of such goods. The poor help to uphold the legitimacy of dominant norms by providing examples of deviance (e.g. the lazy, spendthrift, dishonest, promiscuous, etc.) The poor help to provide emotional satisfaction, evoking compassion, pity, and charity, so that the affluent may feel righteous. Poverty helps to guarantee the status of the non-poor. The poor assist in the upward mobility of the non-poor. For example, by being denied educational opportunities or being stereotyped as “stupid” or “unteachable”, the poor enable others to obtain better jobs with minimal competition. The poor perform cultural functions, like providing labour for Egyptian pyramids, Greek temples, medieval churches, witchcraft, etc. The poor provide “low culture” which is often adopted by the more affluent (e.g. jazz, spirituals, country music, etc.) The poor serve as symbolic constituencies and opponents for several political groups. Politicians often prefer leading the poor. Note: Authors of the above functions for poverty deny that they are showing why poverty should persist; but rather that poverty survives, in part, because it is useful to a number of groups in any society. Poverty Alleviation Poverty alleviation is an important development in its own right. Objectives of poverty alleviation include: Accelerated economic development in general (due to increased national production capacity, as well as increased national purchasing power); Improved investment climate (due to improved social stability); Development of human resources (and hereby increased national capacity for production and management); and Control of migration from the countryside to major towns (rural-urban migration) Strategy elements of poverty alleviation Generation of livelihoods and income; Improved access to social services in general, in particular, to education and health; Reduction in social risks and burdens (for example related to food, housing, health, and low-income livelihoods); Social empowerment; and Reduction of population growth rate Poverty Alleviation in Uganda Uganda’s reduction in poverty kept pace with the strong growth in Gross National Income (GNI) per capita that it experienced from 1999 to 2013. Increase in GNI per capita, for example, saw headcount poverty dramatically reduce from 56% in 1992 to 19.7% in 2013. However, it has recently increased to 27% in 2017 and disparities in poverty levels remain at regional and sub-county levels. In summary, Uganda has progressed strongly in reducing income poverty which is reflected in both monetary and some non-monetary indicators of welfare. Available evidence suggests that Uganda performs well on improved water, literacy, child and maternal mortality, and child nutrition. It is thus important to ask: How did Uganda reduce poverty? Poverty Alleviation Strategies in Uganda After reviewing the theories regarding poverty, we now want to turn to Uganda and have a look at a number of policy initiatives that have been employed over time to reduce poverty. I hope we still recall earlier economic policy programs especially those that were designed after the fall of Idi Amin regime which aimed at recovery and macroeconomic stabilization. I don’t intend to repeat them (refer to student’s reader one). 5 See (UBOS, 2017) Before we turn to the current policy framework for poverty reduction and social transformation, it is important to first understand earlier policies that had a focus on poverty. In any case, the previous policies laid a foundation for the current policies. Most policies that target poverty reduction came out of the 1996 general elections campaigns when citizens told the incumbent president, Yoweri. K. Museveni, that; “we do not eat peace”. In 1997, for example, the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)—a framework for addressing the key poverty challenges, was developed and launched. It provided a framework to guide public action to eradicate poverty. The introduction of the PEAP in 1997 marked Government’s shift in focus from economic rehabilitation to poverty reduction. The PEAP was grouped under five ‘pillars’: (1) Economic management, (2) Production, competitiveness and incomes, (3) Security, conflict-resolution and disaster-management, (4) Good governance, and (5) Human development. The PEAP was accompanied by several important reforms to strengthen budgeting, planning and programme implementation. The Poverty Action Fund (PAF) was introduced in 1998 to ring fence pro-poor spending, helping to translate the PEAP policy priorities into concrete budget allocations. The Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) to planning and programme implementation was another important innovation. This highly participatory process involved wide consultations with stakeholders at each stage of the budget cycle. Achievements of the PEAP Poverty fell from 48% in 1997 to 31% in 2006 The proportion of households with initial endowments of assets and with access to electricity increased PEAP promoted education which has enhanced consumption growth Civil strife and illness ceased Per capita income growth, leading to higher saving and growth rate Mobilized resources for personal security, UPE, health care and water. Domestic revenue rose from 12% of GDP in 1997 to 12.8% in 2004 Private investment increased sharply to reach 23% of GDP in 2007/8 due to positive reform supported by PEAP Economic growth was boosted to over the targeted 7% from below 5.7% in 1997 Why was the PEAP phased out? PEAP was adopted during a period of national consensus. It included the views of all key political stakeholders. But as it went on, it became less and less rallying politically. Introduction of new policy initiatives during periods before and immediately after election campaigns—prosperity for all, the strategic export initiative, and rural development strategy. This didn’t emerge out of the PEAP and they competed with it for resources and state house attention With each revision, PEAP became more complex, more technical and this led to less political ownership. Observers note how consensus and also inclusion of key stakeholders grew especially during the first revision process of the PEAP, another indicator of broad ownership (Kjaer & Muhumuza, 2009, p. 12). Government’s need to develop a national development plan undermined PEAP Development partners were concerned with the expense and conduct of the war in the North; uncertainty about progress towards democracy; fiscal indiscipline especially expansion of districts; and high levels of corruption within the government system. The general feeling among all stakeholders that PEAP had run out of steam The final period of the PEAP (from 2004) and onwards saw a gradual erosion of the original consensus about the agenda. The change in focus has to be seen in relation to Uganda’s first multi-party elections where the NRM ran as a party in 2006. During the campaigns, president Museveni promised “Prosperity for All”. NRM’s election manifesto described NRM’s main purpose as “transforming Uganda from a poor peasant society into a modern, industrial and prosperous society in a stable and peaceful environment” (Kjaer & Muhumuza, 2009, p. 21). Since then, the NRM has focused much on production and wealth creation and less on poverty reduction through social services. To enhance production and wealth creation, the NRM government thought of alternative policies through a national development agenda (Vision 2040). Vision 2040 Over the last two decades that preceded the year 2010, the economy had moved from recovery to growth based on short-to-medium term planning and the country had implemented a number of economic policies including the Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs), Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). As a result, GDP growth had since 2002 been sustained at an average of 6.4%. The macro- economy has since then remained relatively stable with inflation rates maintained at single digit level while public finance and monetary policies have been well managed. A review of global development paths, however, shows that long term planning is a key factor in propelling social-economic development and equitable distribution of wealth in many countries all over the world. A number of Asian countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong adopted long term planning to guide their development paths. The long term planning helped to guide these governments to intervene systematically and through multiple approaches to foster growth. These four Asian countries performed the “growth miracle” of the 20th century (by registering mind-boggling economic growth rates of above 10% for over a decade) and have since taken off to developed nations. That miraculous economic performance earned these four countries the name “East Asian Tigers” In 1999 and 2007, Uganda developed long term perspective development plans, Vision 2025 and drafted Vision 2035, respectively. However, these were not operationalized mainly due to absence of appropriate policy, legal and institutional framework, and lack of ownership at different levels of leadership. Furthermore, the development approach and the economic thinking at that time, coupled with both external and internal factors could not allow their implementation. In order to consolidate and accelerate growth process, government in 2007 approved the Comprehensive National Development Planning Framework policy (CNDPF) which provided for the development of a 30 year Vision to be implemented through: three 10-year plans; six 5-year National Development Plans (NDPs); Sector Investment Plans (SIPs); Local Government Development Plans (LGDPs), Annual work plans and Budgets. Consequently, Cabinet approved the National Vision Statement, “A Transformed Ugandan Society from a Peasant to a Modern and Prosperous Country within 30 years”. The National Planning Authority, in consultation with other government institutions and other stakeholders, has thus developed a Uganda Vision 2040 to operationalize this Vision statement. With this vision, it is hoped, the country will transform from being a predominantly peasant and low income to a competitive, upper middle income status with a per capita income averaging at USD 9,500 by 2040. The Vision provides the development paths and strategies that will guide this transformation and is conceptualized around strengthening the development fundamentals in order to successfully harness the abundant economic opportunities. The Vision 2040 is conceptualized around strengthening “the fundamentals of the economy” to harness the abundant opportunities around the country. The identified opportunities include: Oil and gas Uganda has commercially viable oil and gas deposits in the Albertine Graben. In terms of potential capacity, the reserves are estimated at 3.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. More commercially viable oil and gas deposits are expected to be discovered as continuous explorations are being carried out in the Albertine Graben and other potential areas. This presents the country with opportunity to spur economic growth, create employment, foster technology transfer and generate revenues for investments in development of other strategic sectors such as infrastructure and human resource development. Tourism The country has 50% of the world’s mountain gorillas, 7% of the world’s mammal species including the unique tree climbing lions and white rhinos, 11% of the world’s bird’s species (1061 bird species), and variety of butterflies. Other unique attractions include chimpanzees and golden monkeys. The country has beautiful mountain ranges including the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountain ranges, 2nd largest fresh water lake, third deepest lake in the world and a source of the world’s longest river with beautiful waterfalls and unique water scenery. Minerals Uganda has favorable geo-logical environments that host a wide range and a variety of minerals which provide an opportunity to develop a strong mining industry. It is estimated that the country has over 27 types of minerals in significant commercial viable reserves. For example Iron ore deposits in Kabale and Kisoro areas are estimated to be over 50m tones. Abundant labour force By 2010, it was estimated that over 56 per cent of Uganda’s population is below 18years of age implying that the country has and will continue to have a very young population over the Vision period. The youthful population means that the country is blessed with the potential for an abundant and cheap labour force that can drive the envisaged growth and transformation. Under the current demographic profile, however, this potential is neutralized by a high dependency burden arising out of a high fertility rate. Geographical location and trade Uganda boarders Kenya to the East, Tanzania and Rwanda in the South, Democratic Republic of Congo to the West and South Sudan in the North. This puts her at the heart of Africa which provides it with great opportunities and leverage to participate as a strategic partner in the regional and international economic and political engagements. The country’s location provides it an opportunity to be a member of a number of regional trade blocs such as East African Community, COMESA, SADC and African Union providing it with a wider market and associated membership benefits. Similarly, Uganda’s location makes it a regional hub for industrial production, trade and transit, and air transport. Water resources Uganda has abundant fresh water resources that provide numerous opportunities which can foster faster socio-economic transformation. The fresh water resources cover over a third of Uganda’s surface area with large active storage capacity in lakes Victoria, Albert, Kyoga, George, and Edward. Uganda has a vast network of rivers that connect to these various lakes. Lake Victoria is the source of River Nile which is the longest river in Africa. Agriculture Agricultural production in Uganda is mainly dominated by smallholder farmers engaged in food and industrial crops, forestry, horticulture, fishing and livestock farming. The country is one of the leading producers of coffee and bananas in the World. It is also a major producer of tea, cotton, tobacco, cereals, and livestock and fishing products among many others. However, agriculture productivity of most crops has been reducing over the last decade mainly due to a number of factors including: high costs of inputs, poor production techniques, limited extension services, over dependency on rain fed agriculture, limited markets, land tenure challenges and limited application of technology and innovation. Industrialization Review of development paths of developed and emerging economies show that except for a few oil-exporting countries, there is a strong positive correlation between industrialization and rapid development. Experience from the recent global financial crisis has shown the need to have a strong industrial base to cushion the economy from external shocks. A strong and competitive industrial base is therefore, important to create employment, advance technology and a resilient economy. A few Selected Vision 2040 targets Required reforms to achieve the targets A quasi-market approach, which includes a mix of Government investments in strategic areas and private sector market driven actions while maintaining the private sector as the remain engine of growth and development. Government will make land re-forms to facilitate faster acquisition of land for planned urbanization, infra-structure development, and agricultural commercialization among other developments To achieve faster socio-economic transformation, Government will invest in better urban systems that enhance productivity, liveability and sustainability. These urban areas will be centres of industrial development, financial, trade, education and other services that will foster economic productivity. Uganda will strengthen urban infrastructure and public service facilities, increase the overall carrying capacity of cities and towns and raise the level of urban management To provide the necessary impulse to the economy, Government will embark on front- loading of investments in infrastructure. The key infrastructure areas will be in oil and gas, energy, transport, water for production, STEI and ICT. Government will reform and optimize the industrial structure while establishing a modern industrial sys-tem that will give impetus to industrial transformation. Efforts will be geared to transforming and upgrading manufacturing industries and technology upgrading in enterprises. A policy on the national value system will be developed and implemented to address the current ideological disorientation, citizens’ attitudes and mind sets and non-progressive cultural practices so as to nurture patriotism and national unity. This will produce a responsive and productive citizenry required for transformation. Government will review and strengthen foreign policy to enhance collaboration in accordance with existing and future agreements, standards and protocols within the framework of East African Community, other regional blocs, African Union and global com-munity, for the realization of this Vision. Qn: Discuss the economic and social reforms that the government of Uganda has carried out since 2010 in order to achieve the vision 2040 targets. National Development Plan III (NDPIII) The Second National Development Plan (NDPII) expired in June 2020.The NDP III is the third in a series of plans that aim to implement the Uganda Vision 2040 aspirations. In this regard, Cabinet on 9th September 2019 approved the strategic direction for the NDPIII. The strategic direction is the principle guiding framework for Sectors and Local Governments in the development of their plans. It also enables NPA to engage the decentralized planning institutions (Sectors, MDAs and Local Governments) to identify priorities that were eventually consolidated in National Development Plans as required The ND PIII Strategic Direction Based on the achievements, challenges and lessons learnt from implementing the first and second NDPs, NDPIII will build on the gains to provide the national strategic direction for the next 5 years (2020-2025). In developing the NDP III, the National Planning Authority (NPA) held consultations with various stakeholders. The thrust of the NDPIII will be to reduce the subsistence nature of our economy through industrialization. Five Objectives of NDP III Enhancing value addition in Key Growth Opportunities (Agriculture, Tourism, Minerals, Oil and Gas and Knowledge), Strengthening the private sector to drive growth and create jobs, Consolidating and increasing the Stock and Quality of Productive Infrastructure, Increasing Productivity, Inclusiveness and Wellbeing of the Population Strengthening the role of the public sector in the growth and development process. NDP III Development Strategies To achieve the five objectives, and effectively and efficiently implement NDPIII, several development strategies have been identified through the reviews and consultations that were recently concluded. Maintaining Peace, Security and Good Governance. This is the bedrock upon which development can thrive. The stability so far achieved will be sustained and zealously protected. Maintaining stable macro-economic environment as an anchor for economic growth and development. Beyond inflation targeting and forex management, emphasis will be on increasing savings, investment, capital formation and lowering commercial bank interest rates. Reducing the cost of doing business to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and enhance competitiveness of domestically produced goods and services, both at local and international markets. Priority will be on reducing the cost of power, transport, internet, money, improving business processes, and zealously fighting corruption. Import Replacement and Export Promotion Strategy. An import replacement strategy will be adopted to promote labor-intensive light manufacturing, cottage industries, heavy manufacturing for job creation and technology importation with the major objective of creating jobs for the youth. This will be key to build a sustainable export-oriented economy. Commercialization of agriculture to generate sufficient production volumes to sustain domestic (food security) and external markets. It is critical that we commercialize agriculture and agro- industrialize if we are to reduce the poverty levels in the country side especially in the Eastern and Northern regions of the Country. Harnessing the Tourism potential. This is an area with quick wins, and in the NDPIII we propose to have a hybrid of both elite and mass tourism. We will focus on tourism skills, tourism infrastructure including water, land and air transport, as well as accommodation facilities especially in the least tapped areas. Branding and Marketing Uganda will also be part of this package. Promotion of Science, Technology, Engineering, Innovation (STEI) and a Knowledge driven economy. This will entail STEI infrastructure development, training, policy and institutional framework development, standards development, collaboration and defining a National Research Agenda. Revisiting the role of the Government in strategic areas of the economy. In order to spur balanced growth in the country, and in the spirit of promoting Public Private Partnerships and quasi market approach, it is proposed that government deepens its role to stimulate development. Promotion of Private Sector Investment (Domestic Investment and Foreign Direct Investment). This will be done through maintaining macroeconomic stability, provision of long-term finance at affordable rates, reduction in the amount of domestic arrears and putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the costs of doing business in Uganda are kept low as well as strengthening the use of PPP arrangements. Branding and Marketing in Uganda will also be key to this effort. Mindset change to promote citizens’ focus on development. Ugandans have the potential of becoming more productive; however, they need a change of mindsets with a focus on development. Exploiting opportunities of Urbanization to drive growth. This is important because 65 % of non-agriculture GDP is generated by the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA), with Kampala generating 31 % of the GDP. Improving the wellbeing and productivity of the population by improving the quality of education and health service delivery; reforming vocational education; and increasing social protection through initiatives like health insurance schemes. Increasing Domestic Revenue Mobilization. Domestic revenue will be our main source of financing for NDP III. There is more potential, and significantly more revenue can still be generated through more efficient and effective tax administration by enforcing compliance and reducing tax evasion. Promotion of Social Services based on the Parish Model. As we consolidate delivery of social services, it is recommended that the Parish becomes the Planning and Implementation Unit. Climate change adaptation and environmental management. This strategy will focus on addressing issues of sustaining the rising population while addressing and managing the effects of climate change on livelihoods, incomes and prosperity. The Parish Development Model (PDM) What is the PDM? From Reader 2, we saw how Uganda’s economy is poorly performing on the account of economic transformation. The PDM is a multi-sectoral strategy which government has introduced to create socio- economic transformation, by moving the 39% (3.5 million) households out of the subsistence economy into the money economy, using the Parish/ward as the epicenter for development. It’s a “bottom-up” approach to national planning and budgeting aimed at moving development to the grass roots. PDM is also an NDP III implementation mechanism by both the State and Non-State Actors to achieve “inclusive development” in a coordinated and participatory manner. As contained in the NRM manifesto for 2021 – 2026, it is intended to address the question of creating wealth and jobs for the people, the majority of who are engaged in agriculture. With its implementation strategy, government hopes that the PDM will promote increased incomes through modernisation of agriculture, industrialisation, services and information, communication technology, etc. The PDM will also be the vehicle to organise households into farmer/community groups and support them to focus on the most viable enterprises, improve their yields, quality, bulking, processing and marketing. For subsistence households to transit into the money economy, using the financing facilities, mind-set change, and good governance are necessary factors. The productive sector also requires supportive infrastructure, such as community roads, water for production and connectivity to sources of affordable and reliable energy. These need to be provided by government at the community level. Social Services too are a pre-requisite for improved livelihood. They include health, education, good housing, sanitation and hygiene, as well as environment protection. The PDM is therefore the systematic organisation and empowerment of the population by implementing these interventions in a coordinated manner, at the Parish/ ward administrative level. Background to the PDM The PDM is a result of review of Government development plans both medium-term aspirations and long-term vision as follows: - The NDP I End-of-Term Evaluation and the NDP II Mid-Term Review, recommended the adoption of the PDM. The evaluations identified the strategic role of a parish in improving service delivery, and strengthening production, productivity and value addition for social economic transformation and realization of NDP results. In line with this, the NDP III (Section 10, page 10 and 11) adopted the PDM as a vehicle for increasing household income and welfare. The Comprehensive Evaluation of the Decentralization Policy commissioned by the National Planning Authority (NPA) in 2019 also recommended action of government by deepening decentralisation and devolution to support planning and development at Parish level. The NRM Manifesto 2021-2026 identifies the “Parish” as key administrative unit for implementing all government programmes, working along with non-state actors. The NRM’s argument is that the parish is the unit manned by government operatives closest to the population. Other several programmes of government implemented over time are also seen as precursors to the PDM. These include the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), the Plan for Modernisation of Agriculture (PMA), Wealth for All programme (Bonna Bagagawale), Operation Wealth Creation (OWC), Entandikwa Credit Scheme, Emyoga Wealth Fund and several others, which were implemented at constituency level. There are also affirmative programmes for Regional Development and marginalised groups, such as the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF), Peace Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP), Luwero-Rwenzori Development Programme (LRDP), Karamoja Development Programme (KDP), Uganda Women Empowerment Programme (UWEP), Youth Livelihood Fund (YLF) and others. The view of government is that these programmes have been able to reduce the number of households in subsistence production from 68%, which had persisted for a long time, to 39% by 2020 (UBOS, 2020). This view, however, is not factual; available evidence on development suggests that there is no universal linkage between development policies or programmes and development outcomes. Why the PDM? The purpose of the PDM is to:  Deepen the decentralization process;  Improve household incomes;  Enable inclusive, sustainable, balanced and equitable Socio-economic Transformation;  Increase accountability at local levels. It is hoped that if the above are achieved, it will translate into eradication of poverty and vulnerability, as well as total transformation of the subsistence households (both on-farm and off-farm, in rural and urban settings) into the money economy. How’s the PDM different from other Programmes? The difference between the PDM and the other earlier programmes is that the PDM is anchored on the multi-sectoral and all-inclusive approach, in order to provide holistic improvement in livelihoods and incomes of the households across the Country. It has a clear target of uplifting the 3.5 million households which are still in subsistence mode of living into the money economy. It has a unique integrated monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework and implementation mechanism that emphasises transparency, accountability and results Alignment of PDM to the National Policy Framework PDM will be implemented within the “National Policy of Decentralisation” which provides for building the capacity of local authorities to provide services, prepare and approve work plans, budgets and implement Programmes for the Development of their Communities. The PDM implementation is also aligned to the 5 strategic objectives of the NDPIII; Enhance value addition in key growth opportunities; Strengthen private sector capacity to drive growth and create jobs; Consolidate & increase stock and quality of productive infrastructure; Enhance productivity and wellbeing of population; and Strengthen the role of the state in guiding and facilitating development. For the above alignment to be effective, some key principles have been identified to guide the implementation strategy of the PDM Principles that underpin the PDM Organization: the PDM will focus on organising the subsistence households into formal organizational structures (such as Associations, Cooperatives) to harness economies of scale, access to financial services, production, storage, marketing and extension services. Coordination and Collaboration: the PDM emphasises coordination and collaboration of the State, private sector and civil society to leveraging on the whole of government approach to socio-economic development. Market Orientation: The PDM is premised on all households producing for food and the market and thus will promote modern information communication technology and commercialisation along the value chain. Inclusion: The PDM is all inclusive, systematic and a deliberate approach to intervene at each of the value chain stages, in a coordinated manner to provide affirmative action for special interest groups (women, youth, elderly, and persons with disability). Equity: The PDM shall promote balanced growth across different regions, tribes and gender. Prioritisation: Government shall use the PDM to support “flagship commodities” in a particular ecological zone that link production, processing and marketing enterprises. Evidence based: Decisions and actions under the PDM shall be driven by data, analysis, monitoring, evaluation, learning and results. The PDM will promote a culture of continuous improvement to sustainable results using lessons learnt and experience gained at a reasonable cost. Participation: the PDM recognizes that participation of stakeholders is fundamental to the success in development. It will ensure that communities are empowered to be part of the solutions to local problems and participate in their development process. Transparency and Accountability: that the PDM will include a robust system with checks and balances to ensure that resources reach the intended beneficiaries. It emphasizes operating with integrity and maintaining the highest standards of performance in governance, administration, business processes, financial and human resource management, as well as oversight roles. Assignment: Discuss the seven pillars of the PDM and specific activities that will be carried out for the respective pillars Criticisms of the PDM. What do critics say? The PDM is not new and different from other programmes. That Uganda has used similar models to PDM before and after independence especially those that were used as a basis for local government administration. In such models, for example, village chiefs enforced national programmes on public health, education, education and people’s welfare, household incomes, etc. and yet poverty persisted. Although the PDM’s reporting mechanism is clear on paper, it is bloated. For example, the Parish chief is to report to the Parish Development Council (PDC), the PDC reports to the Parish Council and Sub-County Council, the Parish Council reports to the PDM working Groups, the Working groups report to the PDM Secretariat (at Ministry of Local Government), and the Secretariat reports to the PDM National Council (chaired by the President). Critics say that this high level of bureaucracy in reporting is likely to cloud accountability. Lack of functional structures such as District Service Commissions (in some districts) to facilitate recruitment process of the Parish Chiefs. For example, 80% of the districts did not comply with the 30th September 2021 deadline and some other districts recruited Parish chiefs without following guidelines from Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. Some critics also question the technical capacity of Parish leaders to drive the PDM’s robust implementation strategy since their minimum academic qualification is an ordinary diploma in management. They argue that the capacity of parish leaders to handle budget issues, for example, hasn’t been tested. Some critics also question government’s commitment to fund the PDM. Uganda currently has 10,594 parishes and each parish will be given Ush 100 million. Some say that Uganda’s fiscal space is small to raise these funds every financial year and that government’s priorities could change along the way. What needs to be done for the NDP to succeed? Need to play the ‘development game’ by heterodox rules: although all the high-growth countries accelerated their growth by globalization, they played by different rules from those articulated by the guardians of orthodox globalization. Orthodox globalization, preached by the World Bank, IMF, and Western based academics required countries to open up their borders, liberalize trade and deregulate. However, developing countries that followed these lectures have not developed while those that played by heterodox rules succeeded. Simply put, countries that have benefited the most from globalization are those that did not play trade by the globalization rules preached by the guardians of orthodox globalization (IMF, World Bank, and Western based academics). Need for pragmatic liberalization: although emerging economies liberalized i.e. opening up markets and scaling down government regulations, they did it gradually and pragmatically i.e. by adopting market system on top of a planned system, rather than abandoning the latter altogether. There is a need for Uganda to strike a balance between markets and government regulation. Market regulation doesn’t mean that government has no role whatsoever in regulating business activities. Need to defer gratification i.e., the willingness to sacrifice current satisfaction for future gain: for NDP to succeed, there is need to mobilize Ugandans to increase domestic financial savings to facilitate high investment. East Asian development miracles owe their stupendous growth rates to high domestic savings mobilized by their governments (Singapore’s 42% compulsory wage tax into the “provident fund”, and 25% of GDP saved by each East Asian country) Need to distinguish between pro-market and pro-business policies: countries that promoted pro-market orientation have built rich economies with poor people. Pro-market reforms e.g., removing impediments to markets through economic liberalization, favor new entrants and consumers. This may impede growth of indigenous businesses. To facilitate growth of local businesses and home-grown development, there is need for pro-business policies i.e., focusing on raising profitability of established businesses and industries. In other words, pro-business orientation favors incumbents and producers. It includes easing restrictions on capacity expansion for incumbents, removing price controls, and reducing corporate taxes. This is what India (beginning with 1980), South Korea (in the late 1960s), and China (1970s) did. Need to design policies that would lead to GDP growth with poverty reduction: in the past, Uganda like many other developing countries has increased GDP growth that is not associated with significant poverty reduction. But in East Asia, growth has been punctuated with amazing poverty reduction performance e.g. Malaysia reduced the incidence of poverty from 58% in 1970 to 3.7% in 1995. In the same period, growth rate averaged 6.7% p.a. China reduced poverty from 64% in 1981 to 16% in 2001 amidst average growth rate of 8.5%. In such economies, less emphasis was placed on welfare handouts as a means of dealing with poverty except for the aged and handicapped. Instead, governments emphasized projects that enable the poor to modernize their traditional methods of production and participate in the mainstream of economic activities. Such projects included; Resettlement of the landless, provided with a single-unit houses complete with piped water and electricity “In-situ” development of existing agriculture and rural development with downstream processing of farm products i.e. by encouraging village industries and rural entrepreneurship Establishment of farmers’ markets in urban centres to enable farmers sell their products directly instead of through middlemen Adult education to farmers, not only on topics pertaining to farming but also on subjects related work, attitude, and values Industrial and vocational training for rural manpower including the youths Need for gradualism and sequencing of policy reforms and transformation process: in order to succeed in implementing unpopular-but-fundamental policies in a pluralist and highly participatory democracy, there is need for partial and gradual liberalization. Gradualist strategies are better tailored to pre-existing institutions at home. They economize institution building. Need for markets underpinned by solid public institutions: markets fail when participants engage in fraudulent or anti-competitive behavior. With proper government regulation of markets, cheaters take advantage of the vulnerable, the poor, and make them pay higher prices. Lack of checks and balances on greed can prevent economic development just as lack of markets can. China has used Town and Village Enterprises (TVEs) to provide control rights over enterprises. This has spurred entrepreneurial activity despite the absence of clearly defined property rights. Malaysian government shielded the economy from 1997 financial crisis by imposing capital controls i.e., restrictions on international purchases and sale of financial assets.
