Theme ***Earth and Space Physics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 7 ***STARS AND GALAXIES*** "14 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to understand the life-cycle of stars and the source of their energy. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the source of energy in stars and appreciate the importance of the energy produced by the sun to the people on Earth (k, u); b) appreciate that stars vary in colour and brightness (u); c) know that stars have life cycles and that the fate of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) depends on their initial size (k, u). • In pairs, research and explain in a diagram: • how the sun produces the energy needed for life to survive • that the sun is a relatively small star which will eventually become a red giant, and then a white dwarf • the approximate amount of energy produced by the sun per second, the proportion of the sun’s energy reaching the Earth's surface and the proportion of that which is captured for photosynthesis. • In pairs, research, explain, and report on: • the variation in colour and brightness of stars in the Milky Way in terms of their size and distance from Earth • the different stages in the life cycle of a star • how the nuclear reactions that provide the energy in stars change as they grow older, and that they get hotter • what neutron stars and black holes are and how they were formed • what a supernova is and how it arises;
