Theme ***Light*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should investigate how some objects emit light resulting in light and shade, while other objects, such as a mirror, simply reflect light, and understand the applications of light/shade and reflection. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Know illuminated and light source objects in everyday life (u, s); b) understand how shadows are formed and that eclipses are natural forms of shadows (u); c) understand how the reflection of light from plane surfaces occurs and how we can make use of this (k, u, s, gs). • In groups, brainstorm prior learning about natural and artificial sources of light and the formation of shadows, and explain using diagrams. • In pairs, use your knowledge about how light travels to explain in diagrams how light from the sun reaches the Earth and how eclipses are formed. • In pairs, apply prior learning to investigations of a pinhole camera and use it to explain magnification and image, using diagrams. • In pairs, investigate the characteristics of images formed by plane mirrors and research and explain angles of incidence and reflection; recording findings with (ray) diagrams. Then use this information to verify laws of reflection • In pairs, apply your knowledge of reflection to design, make, and report on a device (periscope) using card and mirrors which would allow a person to see over a wall.
