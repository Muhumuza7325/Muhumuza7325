Competency; The learner uses formulae and equations to determine quantities of matter. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand the concepts of relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass (k, u); b) Analyse the relationship between the number of moles and the number of particles (k, u); c) Analyse the relationship between the number of moles of a substance and its mass (k, u); d) Analyse the relationship between the number of moles of a gas and its volume (k, u); e) Synthesise chemical formulae (u); f) Interpret chemical equations (k, u); g) Practice scientific attitudes and values in investigating matter (u). Right from the very start, we did carry out diffusion and brownian motion experiments to show that matter is made up of particles. We learnt that diffusion is the movement of molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. And we said that diffusion is due to the bombardment of the particles with the moving air molecules. We covered diffusion in Gases; A drop of reddish-brown bromine liquid was placed into a gas jar containing air and the gas jar was covered. The liquid bromine vapourised and the gas jar got filled with bromine vapour. The bromine particles and particles of air had mixed thoroughly. We also covered diffusion of ammonia and hydrogen chloride. Figure89.3.3.formulae_stoichiometry_and_mole_concept_image_001.jpg. In that experiment, a piece of cotton wool is soaked in concentrated hydrochloric acid (which gives off hydrogen chloride fumes) and placed at one end, A, of a long glass tube and another piece of cotton wool soaked in concentrated Ammonia (which gives off ammonia fumes) is placed at the other end. After about 5 minutes, the white ring forms. This white ring does not form immediately because the gas particles have to encounter air particles in the tube before they meet. And recall that the white ring forms nearer the hydrochloric acid end, A. This is because Ammonia particles are lighter and thus diffuse faster. In conclusion, we said, the white ring is due to the formation of Ammonium chloride; NH₃(g) + HCl(g) → NH₄Cl(s). We also covered diffusion in liquids. The procedure was as follows; • Pour some water into a beaker until it’s half full. • Drop in a crystal of potassium manganate (VII). • Leave to stand for 10 minutes. Observation: The purple colour of potassium manganate (VII) spreads throughout the whole solution. Hope you recall brownian motion which is the movement of small particles making up matter. Brownian motion is best studied by the smoke cell experiment. The smoke is sucked into the cell and illuminated. The movement of the smoke particles is then observed through a microscope. Observation: The smoke particles are seen in a continuous rapid random movement. This type of movement is what is called Brownian motion and unlike diffusion, it is independent of the concentration gradient. Another way to see this motion is by suspending pollen grains in water and observing them under a microscope. These pollen grains will exhibit erratic, jiggling movements despite no currents in the water. In summary, through the above experiments, we did confirm that matter is made of particles. To start our chapter, the Mole concept deals with determining or counting the number of these particles. Since these particles usually exist in incredibly large quantities, it becomes very difficult to deal with large numbers; Therefore, these particles are placed in groups called moles. One mole of a substance has 6.02×10²³ particles. The particles of substances grouped into moles can be molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, radicals, protons or any other specified particles. For example, 1 mole of magnesium atoms contains 6.02×10²³ atoms, 1 mole of magnesium ions contains 6.02×10²³ ions, 1 mole of H₂SO₄(aq) molecules contains 6.02×10²³ molecules of H₂SO₄(aq). The mole. Exactly, what is a mole?; The mole is a unit of measurement based on a fixed number of particles. A mole of any substance is the amount of it which contain as many particles (atoms, molecules, ions, electrons) as there are carbon atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. The actual number of atoms of carbon in 12g of carbon-12 was determined by Avogadro and is known as the Avogadro’s number or Avogadro’s constant. Meaning, the number of particles in one mole of any substance is 6.02x10²³, the Avogadro’s constant, denoted by N_A. Note: 1 Mole = 6.02x10²³ particles. The number of moles of a substance can be obtained by dividing the total number of particles by the Avogadro’s constant. Number of moles = Number of particles/(6×10²³) [To be covered in detail later]. Significance: The mole is a fundamental unit used in chemistry. The mole is quite fundamental because it provides a convenient way to quantify the amount of a substance in terms of the number of particles it contains. A mole is the base unit of the amount of substance in the International System of Units (SI). Video37.How_big_is_a_mole.mp4. [Group Work 1] {Explain in detail, the concepts of relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass}. Common Terms Used: 1) Atomic mass: The average mass of one mole of atoms of an element. 2) Relative atomic mass (R.A.M): The mass of an atom of an element compared to 1/12ᵗʰ of the mass of carbon-12 atom. It is calculated by dividing the average mass of one atom of the element by 1/12ᵗʰ of the mass of carbon-12 atom. Relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity (no units) because it's a ratio. Using the formula above, hydrogen was given a mass of 1.0008 ≈ 1, Oxygen [16], Nitrogen [14], etc. The relative atomic mass is not always a whole number due to the presence of isotopes. In such a case, the value is obtained by taking the average of the relative masses of isotopes of an element based on their natural abundance. 3) Molar mass. This is the mass of one mole of a substance (element or compound). It’s the sum of molar masses of the constituent atoms. It is equal to the relative atomic mass expressed in grams. Units (grams per mole, g/mol). The relative atomic masses of most elements have already been established. Examples are given below: [Atom] [Relative atomic mass] [Molar mass]; Hydrogen [1]	[1.008 g/mol]; Carbon [12] [12.011 g/mol]; Oxygen [16] [16.00 g/mol (approximation)]; Sodium [23] [22.990 g/mol]; Magnesium [24] [24.305 g/mol]; Sulphur [32] [32.06 g/mol]; Aluminium [27] [26.982 g/mol]; Copper [64] [63.546 g/mol]; Silver [108] [107.868 g/mol]; Lead [207] [207.2 g/mol]; Chlorine [35.45 g/mol] [35.5g]; Calcium [40] [40.078 g/mol]; Potassium [39] [39.098 g/mol]; Tin [119] [118.710 g/mol]; Zinc [65] [65.38 g/mol]; Nickel [59] [58.693 g/mol]; Nitrogen [14] [14.007 g/mol]; Iron [56] [55.845 g/mol]; Phosphorus [31] [30.974 g/mol]. 4) Formula Mass: This is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms present in one molecule of a compound. It's calculated by adding the relative atomic masses of each element in the compound's formula, multiplied by their corresponding number of atoms. Thus, formula mass has no units. 5) Molecular Mass: This refers to the mass of one mole of a molecule. It's numerically equivalent to the formula mass, but expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). 6) Relative Molecular Mass (RMM): RMM is a dimensionless quantity (no units) that represents the mass of one molecule of a substance relative to the mass of 1/12ᵗʰ of a carbon-12 atom. It's a useful concept for comparing the masses of different molecules. 7) Relative Formula Mass (RFM): Ionic compounds, unlike molecules, don't have a well-defined molecular structure. Therefore, we use the term "relative formula mass" (RFM) instead of RMM. RFM is calculated similarly to RMM, by summing the relative atomic masses of all atoms in the formula of an ionic compound. It's also a dimensionless quantity (no units). • In groups, collect and interpret data concerning relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass based on carbon-12 scale and discuss its use as a standard for determining relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass.

Calculation of percentage composition. From the formula of a compound, we can calculate the percentage by mass of each element in a compound. Percentage by mass of an element X (%) = [(Number of atoms of X × Atomic mass of X) / Molar mass of the compound (g/mol)]×100%. This formula assumes the compound has a fixed number of atoms for each element as defined by its chemical formula. If a compound has variable composition, a more complex approach considering isotope abundance might be necessary. 1) Calculate the percentage of Iron by mass in hydrated Iron (II) sulphate crystals, FeSO₄.7H₂O (Fe = 56, S = 32, O = 16, H = 1).

[Group Work 3] {Analyse the relationship between the number of moles of a substance and its mass}. Calculating numbers of moles given mases. Converting masses to moles. Masses and moles of elements or compounds are actually related. For atoms, 1 mole is equivalent to Relative atomic mass (R.A.M) in grams. For example: 1 mole of Cu = 64g; 1 mole of S = 32g; 1 mole of H = 1g. For molecules, 1 mole is equivalent to the relative molecular mass (RMM) or relative formula mass (RFM). For example: 1 mole of H₂O = 18g; 1 mole of CaCO₃ = 100g; 1 mole of H₂SO₄ = 98g. The number of moles can be obtained by dividing the mass of the substance in grams by its molar mass. Number of moles = Mass(g) / Molar mass (g/mol). Examples. 1) Calculate the number of moles of 3.31g of lead nitrate (N = 14, O = 16, Pb = 207).

Empirical Formula. The empirical formula of a compound is the formula which shows the number of atoms and the simplest ratio in which they exist. It is also called the simplest formula. Steps in calculating the empirical formulae. 1) Write down the symbols of the elements present; 2) Write down the percentage composition or composition by mass below the symbols; 3) Find the number of moles of each element by dividing the percentage composition or mass by Relative Atomic Mass; 4) Find the mole ratio of the elements by dividing the moles with the smallest number; 5) Write down the empirical number. If the mole ratio is in fractions: 1) Round off to the nearest whole number if it is very close to the whole number. 2) Multiply by a small number that converts the fraction to a whole number if the fraction is not close to a whole number.

Molecular formula = (Empirical formula)n = Molecular mass; n is the number to be determined. However, it's important to understand that not all compounds have a simple whole number relationship between their empirical and molecular formulas.

[Group Work 6] {Analyse the relationship between the number of moles of a gas and its volume}. Molecular theory of gases. The behaviour of gases when subjected to temperature and pressure changes can be expressed in two simple laws i.e., Boyle’s law and Charles’ law. These laws apply to ideal gases (i.e., gases with negligible inter molecular forces of attraction and negligible volume). Boyle’s law. It states that the volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature. Mathematically, V α 1/P, where P = pressure, V = volume; V = a constant * 1/P; V = a constant/P; PV = a constant. An ideal gas at a pressure P₁, occupying volume, V₁, can be made to occupy volume, V₂, at a pressure, P₂. Therefore, P₁V₁ = P₂V₂. Charles’ law. It states that the volume of a given mass of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at a constant pressure. Mathematically, V α T; V = a constant * T; V/T = a constant. On relating Volumes and absolute temperatures of an ideal gas at different values, we conclude that V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂. The temperature at which the volume of gases would be theoretically zero is the absolute temperature or absolute zero. The temperatures on the absolute temperature scale/Kelvin scale are measured in kelvins and are obtained by adding 273.15 to the temperature on the Celsius scale. i.e., 273.15K = 0˚C. For example, if the temperature is 100˚C, on the Kelvin scale it will be (100 + 273.15) = 373.15K. The combined gas equation: This an equation that combines both the Boyle's law (V α 1/P) and Charle's law (V α T). On combining these two laws, we get V α 1/P α T; V = a constant * T * 1/P; V = a constant * T/P; PV/T = a constant. If the pressure, volume and temperature of a fixed mass of a gas are changed from P₁, V₁ and T₁ to P₂, V₂ and T₂ respectively, then P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂ [The combined gas equation]. Avogadro's law. It states that at constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas. Mathematically, this is expressed as V α n; V = a constant * n; V/n = a constant. In terms of two sets of data: V₁/n₁ = V₂/n₂. The ideal gas equation: This equation is obtained by combining the Boyle’s law (V α 1/P), Charles’ law (V α T) and Avogadro's law (V α n). Combining the 3 gas laws gives: V α 1/P α T α n; V = R * 1/P * T * n; PV = nRT, where R is the ideal gas constant. This is the ideal gas equation. It relates the pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and number of moles (n) of an ideal gas. It is important to note that real gases deviate from the ideal behaviour at high pressures and low temperatures due to the influence of inter molecular forces and non-zero volume of the gas molecules themselves. However, the ideal gas equation becomes a good approximation for real gases at moderate pressures and high temperatures. Notice that the combined gas law (P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂) can also be derived from the ideal gas law, when considering a fixed amount of gas, which corresponds to n = 1 mole in the ideal gas equation. When n = 1, PV = RT; PV/T = R (a constant); P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂. The combined gas equation enables one to calculate the effect of a change in temperature and pressure on the volume of a gas. It's equally important to note that gas volumes cannot be compared unless they are measured under the same temperature and pressure conditions. Gas volumes are usually compared at 0˚C (273.15K) and 1 atmosphere (760mmHg/101.3kPa), which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. These conditions are referred to as standard temperature and pressure (STP). Sometimes, volumes are quoted at room temperature and pressure (RTP): In scientific contexts, RTP is often defined more precisely, at a temperature around 20-25 degrees Celsius (68-77 degrees Fahrenheit), but this can still vary slightly depending on the specific application, and in most cases, room pressure is considered to be approximately equal to atmospheric pressure at sea level, which is about 101.3kPa or 1atm. In summary, while both equations deal with the behaviour of gases, the combined gas law specifically relates pressure, volume, and temperature changes for a fixed amount of gas, while the ideal gas equation describes the overall behaviour of an ideal gas under various conditions.

What volume will it occupy (still gaseous) at -20˚C and 770mmHg pressure?; Figure98.3.3.formulae_stoichiometry_and_mole_concept_image_010.jpg. 2) A certain mass of a gas occupies 146cm³ at 18˚C and 738mmHg pressure. Calculate its volume at STP. P₁ = 738mmHg, T₁ = (18 + 273)K = 291K and V₁ = 146cm³. P₂ = 760mmHg, T₂ = 273K and V₂ = ?; V₂ = 133cm³. Gay-Lussac’s law/Pressure-Temperature Law. This is a gas law which states that the pressure exerted by a gas (of a given mass and kept at a constant volume) varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas. In other words, the pressure exerted by a gas is proportional to the temperature of the gas when the mass is fixed and the volume is constant. This law was formulated by the French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac in the year 1808. Note that this law applies to any gas, not just ideal gases. The mathematical expression of Gay-Lussac’s law can be written as follows: P α T; P/T = a constant; P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂. Examples of the Gay-Lussac’s Law: When a pressurized aerosol can (such as a deodorant can or a spray-paint can) is heated, the resulting increase in the pressure exerted by the gases on the container (owing to Gay-Lussac’s law) can result in an explosion. This is the reason why many pressurized containers have warning labels stating that the container must be kept away from fire and stored in a cool environment. Another example of Gay-Lussac’s law can be observed in pressure cookers. When the cooker is heated, the pressure exerted by the steam inside the container increases. The high temperature and pressure inside the container cook the food faster. Exercise. 1) The pressure of a gas in a cylinder when it is heated to a temperature of 250K is 1.5 atm. What was the initial temperature of the gas if its initial pressure was 1 atm?; P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂; T₁ = (1*250)/(1.5) = 166.66K. 2) At a temperature of 300K, the pressure of the gas in a deodorant can is 3atm. Calculate the pressure of the gas when it is heated to 900K. P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂; P₂ = (3atm*900K)/300K = 9atm. Gay-Lussac’s law of Combining Volumes. This is a law describing the behaviour of gases when involved in chemical reactions. The law states that when gases react, they do so in volumes which bear a simple ratio to one another and to the volume of the product if gaseous, provided the temperature and pressure remains constant. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac studied chemical reactions between gases and noticed that there is always a very simple ratio between the volumes of gases that react together. For instance: 1) 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g); 2 volumes of hydrogen combine with 1 volume of oxygen to form 2 volumes of steam; 2) H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g); 1 volume of hydrogen combines with 1 volume of chlorine to form 2 volumes of hydrogen chloride gas; 3) N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ↔ 2NH₃(g); 1 volume of nitrogen combines with 3 volumes of hydrogen to form 2 volumes of ammonia gas; Examples. 1) 100cm³ of hydrogen were burnt in excess chlorine. Determine: a) The volume of chlorine used; b) The volume of gaseous product formed; a) H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g); 1 volume of hydrogen combines with 1 volume of chlorine; 100cm³ of H₂ combines with (100x1)/1cm³ of Cl₂ = 100cm³ of chlorine; b) From the equation, 1 volume of H₂ produces 2 volumes of HCl; 1 volume of H₂ produces 2 volumes of HCl; 100cm³ of H₂ produces (100x2)/1cm³ of HCl = 200cm³ of HCl. 2) 80cm³ of oxygen are exploded with 80cm³ of hydrogen, determine the volume of the unused gas (residual gas) at room temperature. 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g); 2 volumes of hydrogen combine with 1 volume of oxygen; 80cm³ of hydrogen combines with (80x1)/2cm³ of oxygen = 40cm³ of oxygen; Unused gas (oxygen) = original volume of oxygen - used volume = (80-40) cm³ = 40cm³ of unused oxygen; 3) 48cm³ of methane was exploded with 212cm³ of oxygen at a certain temperature and pressure. The mixture was then allowed to attain room temperature and pressure. Determine the volume of each of the remaining gases. CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g); 1 volume of methane combines with 2 volumes of oxygen; 48cm³ of methane combines with (48x2)/1cm³ of oxygen = 96cm³ of oxygen; All the methane was used up and (212-96) = 116cm³ of oxygen remained unused; Also, from the equation, 1 volume of methane produces 1 volume of carbon dioxide; 48cm³ of methane produces (48x1)/1cm³ of carbon dioxide = 48cm³ of carbon dioxide. NB: At room temperature, the 2 volumes of steam produced condensed to water; The remaining gases are unused oxygen + carbon dioxide formed = (116 + 48)cm³ = 164cm³. 4) N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ↔ 2NH₃(g).

What would be the volume of each of the remaining gases. 3) 50cm³ of oxygen were added to a 40cm³ mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen. After explosion and cooling to the original temperature, the residual gas occupied 45cm³. What was the percentage of oxygen in the original mixture (Answer is 75%). 4) Calculate the volume of oxygen required for the complete combustion of 200cm³ of ethane (C₂H₅). What was the volume of gas product formed?; Connecting Gas Volumes, Molecules, Relative Molecular Mass and Vapour density. The Avogadro’s law gives an interpretation to the Gay-Lussac’s law of Combining Volumes in terms of molecules of gases. Consider the following examples. 1) 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g); 2 volumes of hydrogen combine with 1 volume of oxygen to form 2 volumes of Steam; This is interpreted as 2 molecules of hydrogen combine with 1 molecule of oxygen to form 2 molecules of steam. 2) H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g); 1 volume of hydrogen combines with 1 volume of chlorine to form 2 volumes of hydrogen chloride gas; This is interpreted as 1 molecule of hydrogen combines with 1 molecule of chlorine to form 2 molecules of hydrogen chloride gas; The Avogadro’s law is quite important because it enables us to change from a statement about volumes of gases to the same statement about moles of gases and vice-versa; The relationship between vapour density and Relative Molecular Mass earlier covered can be deduced from the Avogadro’s law. Vapour density of a gas expresses the mass of a certain volume of the gas compared with the mass of the same volume of hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure. Vapour density = Mass of 1 volume of a gas / Mass of 1 volume of hydrogen (H₂) gas. Vapour density can be determined experimentally since it involves weighing an equal volume of hydrogen gas and the gas of interest. By applying Avogadro’s law; Vapour density = Mass of 1 molecule of a gas / Mass of 2 atoms of hydrogen gas; Vapour density = Mass of 1 molecule of a gas / (2*1). Therefore, mass of 1 molecule of a gas (RMM of a gas) = 2 x Vapour density, i.e., Relative Molecular Mass is twice the value of vapour density. Thus, the relative molecular mass of a gas is directly proportional to its vapour density. It also follows from the Avogadro’s law that if equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules, then the volume occupied by one mole must be the same for all gases. This constant volume is called the gas molar volume/molar gas volume. The Molar gas volume is the volume occupied by one mole of gas at STP or room temperature. It’s the same for all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. STP refers to standard temperature and pressure. Molar gas volume at STP is 22.4l or 22.4dm³ or 22400cm³. Molar gas volume at room temperature is 24l or 24dm³ or 2400cm³. Note that the relationship between Avogadro's constant and molar gas volume becomes clear when you consider the fact that one mole of any gas at STP occupies the same volume (22.4l) and contains the same number of molecules (N_A). Calculating moles of gas given volume and molar volume. 1) Calculate the number of moles of Ammonia present in 3.6dm³ at room temperature. 24dm³ contain 1 mole of ammonia. 3.6dm³ contain (3.6x1)/24 moles of NH₃ = 0.15 moles of NH₃. 2) Calculate the number of moles in 1.12dm³ of hydrogen gas at STP. 22.4dm³ contain 1 mole of H₂. 1.12dm³ contain (1.12x1)/22.4 moles = 0.05 moles. 3) Calculate the number of moles of ammonia gas in 560cm³. 22400cm³ contain 1 mole of NH₃. 560cm³ contain (560x1)/22400 moles of NH₃ = 0.025 moles. 4) Calculate the number of moles in 600cm³ of hydrogen chloride gas at room temperature (Answer: 0.0267 moles). 5) Determine the number of moles in the following gaseous volumes at STP: a) 1.2dm³ of nitrogen. b) 300cm³ of ammonia. a) (Answer: 0.05 moles of nitrogen at STP). b) (Answer: 0.013 moles of ammonia at STP). 6) Determine at RTP the volume and mass of: a) 0.04 moles of hydrogen. b) 0.2 moles of carbon dioxide. a) Ans: 0.96l of hydrogen at RTP and 0.08g of hydrogen. b) Ans: 4.8l of carbon dioxide at RTP and 8.8g of carbon dioxide. 7) Calculate the RMM of Y given that 0.8g of Y occupies 560cm³ at STP.

Calculation of masses from equations. Moles and mole ratios can be used to calculate the amount of substances reacting and products formed. This requires that a correctly balanced equation is written. Such an equation is known as a stoichiometric equation. Stoichiometry is the relationship between amounts of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. A stoichiometric equation is an equation in which the reactants and products are correctly balanced. Steps involved in the calculation. 1) Write down a balanced equation for the reaction. 2) Write down the moles of substances that concerns the question. 3) Convert the moles into grammes. Examples. 1) Calculate the mass of iron (II) sulphide formed by heating 64g of sulphur with excess iron fillings (S = 32, Fe = 56). Molar mass of FeS = 56 + 32 = 88g. Equation for reaction.

[Group Work 7] {In groups, practice scientific attitudes and values in investigating matter}. In the relentless pursuit of knowledge, scientists rely not only on rigorous methods and honed skills, but also on a core set of attitudes and values. These scientific attitudes are the different qualities and virtues that shape a scientist's approach to investigation. They determine how far scientists delve, how rigorously they analyse, and ultimately, how much they contribute to the vast tapestry of scientific understanding. Just as a strong foundation is crucial for a sturdy building, these positive scientific attitudes and values have played a vital role in propelling scientific advancements and leading to the numerous benefits we enjoy today. The positive scientific attitudes and values practiced by scientists include: a) Objectivity: Scientists strive to be objective, meaning they set aside personal biases and base their conclusions solely on evidence gathered through meticulous observation and experimentation. Double-blind experiments, where neither participants nor researchers know who is receiving the treatment being studied, are a prime example of how objectivity safeguards the integrity of research by minimizing bias. This ensures that scientific findings are reliable, reproducible, and truly reflect the underlying phenomena. b) Curiosity: Scientists are driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world around them. This relentless questioning fuels their desire to explore the unknown, delve deeper into existing knowledge, and seek answers to ever-more intricate problems. It is this insatiable curiosity that has led to groundbreaking discoveries and the formulation of widely used concepts that form the very foundation of various scientific fields. c) Honesty: Scientific progress thrives on honesty. Scientists have a responsibility to report their findings and ideas with utmost integrity and transparency. This includes acknowledging limitations, reporting unexpected results, and sharing data openly for peer review. Honesty fosters trust within the scientific community and ensures that scientific knowledge is built upon a foundation of truth and ethical conduct. d) Flexibility: Science is a dynamic endeavour. New evidence can emerge at any time, and established theories may need to be revised or even discarded in the face of compelling contradictions. Scientists must be flexible and open to the possibility that their current understanding might not be the whole picture. This willingness to adapt existing ideas in light of new evidence allows science to constantly evolve and refine its understanding of the universe. e) Openness to Review: Scientific inquiry is a collaborative process. Scientists are always willing to review the work of others and subject their own findings to rigorous scrutiny by peers. Peer review, where experts in the field critically evaluate research, strengthens the validity of scientific findings. It helps identify flaws, ensures the soundness of methodologies, and ultimately leads to a more robust body of scientific knowledge. By embodying these core attitudes and values, scientists ensure that their work is not only rigorous but also trustworthy and impactful. These values are as essential to scientific progress as the tools and techniques employed in the laboratory. They are the guiding principles that propel scientific discovery forward, leading to advancements that continue to shape our world for the better. • In groups, research on and prepare a presentation to identify and justify positive scientific attitudes and values practised by scientists in doing research on mole concept, chemical formulae and chemical equations for easy and systematic communication in the field of chemistry. **Volumetric analysis**. In an investigation to determine the nature of matter in a substance, a chemist focuses on two main questions: a) What are the components of the substance?; b) What amount of each component is present in the substance?; In an attempt to answer question (a) and (b), a chemist carries out qualitative and quantitative analysis respectively. Most of the reactions which a chemist carries out take place in solution. Consider the reaction below; A(aq) + B(aq) → C(aq) + D(aq); If we are to determine the volume of A needed to completely react with a given amount or volume of B, the answer is provided practically through volumetric analysis. In volumetric analysis, quantities of substances (often acids or alkalis) are estimated by analytical processes involving measurements of volumes of solutions using pipettes, burettes and measuring cylinders (for approximate measurement). Weighing may also be involved. Most of the work in volumetric analysis is based upon molar (M) solutions. Standard and Molar solutions. A standard solution is a solution of known concentration. Examples of standard solutions include: A solution containing 12g of sodium chloride in one litre of a solution; A solution containing 2 moles of solute in 1dm³ etc. The substance that is used to prepare a standard solution is known as a primary standard. Examples of commonly used primary standards include sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) for acid-base titrations and potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) for redox titrations. A molar solution is a solution containing one mole of solute in one litre of solution. A molar solution of any compound contains one mole of that compound in one litre (1000cm³) of a solution. Common terms used: 1) Concentration: Concentration refers to the amount of solute dissolved in a specific volume of solvent. 2) Concentration in grams per litre is the mass of a substance dissolved in 1 litre of solution. 3) Standard solution is a solution whose concentration is known. 4) Molarity is the number of moles of a solute contained in one litre of solution. The concentration of the solution is often referred to as molarity. Units of molarity: moles per litre (mol/l) or mol/dm³, commonly denoted as M. E.g., 0.2M NaOH means 1 litre of a solution containing 0.2 moles of NaOH. Note: 1 litre (1l) = 1cubic decimetre (1dm³) = 1000 cubic centimetre (1000cm³). Molar mass, concentration in grams per litre and molarity are related by: Molarity = concentration (g/l)/molar mass. Calculating molarity given mass and volume.

Figure106.3.3.formulae_stoichiometry_and_mole_concept_image_004.jpg. c) 2dm³ of solution contains 53g of Na₂CO₃; 1dm³ of solution contains (1x53)/2g of Na₂CO₃; = 26.5g/dm³ of Na₂CO₃ (concentration in grams/litre); RMM of Na₂CO₃ = 23x2 + 12 + 16x3 = 106; 106g is contained in 1 mole of Na₂CO₃; 26.5g is contained in (26.5x1)/106 moles of Na₂CO₃; = 0.25M Na₂CO₃; In general, Molarity = concentration (g/l)/molar mass; Molarity = 26.5/106 = 0.25M Na₂CO₃; When the concentration of a solute in grams per litre and the RMM are known, then the molarity can be calculated from the above expression.

What is Titration?; Titration is a method of volumetric analysis in which a solution (usually a standard solution) is added from a burette to another solution (usually whose concentration is unknown) until the reaction is complete. An indicator changes colour immediately the reaction is complete or when the end point is reached. Most titrations at this level are acid-base titrations. Figure116.3.3.formulae_stoichiometry_and_mole_concept_image_014.jpg. Apparatus commonly used in titration. Pipette: This is used for measuring and transferring fixed volumes of solutions. The volume of solution (usually whose concentration is not known) is measured accurately and transferred into a conical flask using a pipette. The solution transferred by the pipette is the aliquot. The common pipettes used are of volumes 20.0cm³ and 25.0cm³ which are usually written on them. The reading of a pipette is recorded to one decimal place e.g., 20.0cm³. Burette: This is used to transfer accurately a precise volume of solution. The titrant is filled into a burette using a filter funnel to prevent wastage of solutions. The reading of a burette is recorded to two decimal places e.g. 0.00cm³, 18.40cm³ etc. For accurate reading of volumes of liquid in burettes and pipettes, the eye must be at the same level with the meniscus of the liquid. Conical flask: It is a container in which the reaction between the acid and the alkali take place. The titrant is run from a burette into a conical flask containing a known volume of the solution (usually whose concentration is not known). White tile: The white tile enables one to observe indicator colour changes more clearly. A piece of white paper can be used in place of a white tile. Filter funnel: Enables the solution to be poured directly into the burette without wastage. Dropper: For addition of the indicator to the solution in the conical flask. Beaker: For holding and pouring out solutions. Procedure for acid-base titration; Figure117.3.3.formulae_stoichiometry_and_mole_concept_image_015.jpg. 1) Wash the pipette with distilled water, then a little of the solution it is to measure. Use the pipette to deliver either 20.0cm³ or 25.0cm³ of the alkali into a clean conical flask. Add a few drops (2 or 3 drops) of an indicator. 2) Wash the burette with distilled water, then a little of the acid solution and run out the acid through the tap. Fill the burette above the 0cm³ mark and run a little of the acid out to bring the meniscus of the acid to the 0cm³ mark or slightly below it. Take the burette reading as V₁cm³. 3) Arrange the apparatus as shown in the figure above. Run the acid solution from the burette drop wise. Use your left hand to open the tap and your right hand to swirl the conical flask (unless you are left-handed). Stop when the indicator just changes colour. This is the end point the titration. 4) Take the burette reading again, V₂cm³. Subtract (V₂- V₁) cm³ to get the titre (i.e., the volume of the acid needed to neutralize the known volume of alkali). 5) Repeat the titration and obtain an average titre. From this volume you can calculate the unknown concentration. N.B: The first titration is regarded as a trial run (rough titration) and may not be very accurate, therefore the value may not be used in computing the average volume. Values used in calculating the average volume must be close to each other. Video6.Setting_up_and_Performing_a_Titration.
