Theme ***Introduction to Geography*** "@OMD". TOPIC 2 ***SHOWING THE LOCAL AREA ON A MAP*** "6 PERIODS". Competency; The learner knows the main physical and human features of the local area and how they can be shown on a map. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know what a map is and how this can be used to show places (k); b) understand the difference between a map and a photograph (u, s); c) understand that maps are representations of the world at different scales (u); d) draw a sketch map of the school and/or the local area (s); e) use and interpret symbols and identify features on a map using a key (s); f) identify directions on a map using basic compass points (s); g) follow routes on a map (s); h) use the local area maps drawn in (d) above to find information about people living in the local area (s). What is a map? • use globes, a range of maps (including digital maps) and aerial images to investigate what a map is and what it might show. • draw a map to show a visitor to the area how to get to the school (no one should tell you how to draw it). Compare and evaluate each other’s maps and identify ways to improve them. • Through fieldwork, use maps and compasses to orient yourselves and sketch what you can see in that direction, annotating features. • In pairs, draw a map to show the route from your school to home, indicating physical and human features using a key, and then swap maps so you can find out where the other person lives. • use your own and other maps to help you ask and answer questions about your local area;
