Manufacturing industries • Revision by questioning: In studying East Africa, you learn about three kinds of industries: mining industries; agricultural processing industries; and manufacturing industries. You have looked at mining industries and agricultural processing industries in different topics. Now we will look at manufacturing industries. What two kinds of manufacturing industries are there? (consumer goods and industrial/producer goods industries). • Either recap an earlier fieldtrip to a factory site or arrange a visit and create a small case study identifying what happens there, the positive and negative impacts of the factory on the people, the environment and economy and to explain how you feel about it. • Using a map, find out examples of major industrial areas in Africa (Accra-Tema, Ghana; Lower Egypt industrial area; Witwatersrand or Rand industrial area, South Africa). Draw your own map or annotate a digital one. • Construct a table to compare these industrial areas under the following headings and illustrate with your own sketch maps or digitally sourced maps. Columns (Accra-Tema, Egypt, Rand). Rows (Factors, Raw materials, Power, Raw materials, Fresh water, Land, Relief, Transport, Capital, Labour, Market, Government policies). • For each area, explain the main industries and their ownership. • Use Internet to compile the above table. • Working in groups, discuss the advantages of African countries establishing manufacturing industries.
