Theme ***Mechanics and Properties of Matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 2 ***MEASUREMENTS IN PHYSICS*** "30 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to estimate and measure length, area, volume, mass, density, and time and express them using appropriate units. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand how to estimate and measure physical quantities: length, area, volume, mass, and time (u, s, gs); b) explain how they choose the right measuring instrument and units; explain how to use the instruments to ensure accuracy (u, s); c) appreciate that the accuracy of measurements may be improved by making several measurements and taking an average value (gs, v/a); d) identify potential sources of error in measurement and devise strategies to minimise them (u, s, v/a); e) understand the scientific method and explain the steps used in relation to the study of physics (u); f) know that practical investigations involve a ‘fair test’, analysis, prediction and justification of results, and observations, and apply learning in practice (k, s); g) record data in graphs and charts and look for trends (u, s); h) understand and be able to use scientific notation and significant figures (u, s); i) understand density and its application to floating and sinking (u); j) determine densities of substances and relate them to purity (u, s, gs); k) understand the global nature of ocean currents and how they are driven by changes in water density and temperature (u, s). • In groups, examine, discuss, research, and make notes on the accurate use of tape measures, rulers, vernier calipers, stop clocks/watches, balances, measuring cylinders, and displacement cans. • In pairs, choose appropriate units, record estimates, and then make and record accurate measurements of each of the following: the length of a football pitch, the width of a classroom, the area of a desk top, the thickness of a desk top, the time a friend takes to walk 20 paces, the mass of a pen, the volume of water in a container, the volume of a regular and an irregular solid • In pairs, compare estimates and accurate measurements, agree on techniques for selecting measuring instruments and units and for ensuring accuracy/ minimising error before completing reports on class conclusions. • In groups, plan, carry out, and report on a simple investigation, e.g. to compare the rate of cooling of water and a strong salt solution, considering: • predictions/hypotheses • ensuring a fair test, controlled and measured variables • selection of equipment and materials • frequency of measurements • accuracy of measurements • recording results in a table • presenting results in a graph • analysis of results and drawing conclusions. • possible sources of error • possible improvements. • In pairs, research on the use of scientific notation before class discussion about the need for its use when dealing with very large or small numbers (e.g. × 10 6, 4.31 x 10−3). • Individually practice • Identifying and rounding of numbers to required significant figures • converting large & small numbers into scientific notation • In groups, predict whether solids float or sink in water and record conclusions, then plan, carry out and report on a practical investigation to find the densities of the solids and compare results with the theoretical values and predictions on floating. • In pairs, research, discuss, and produce a report on: • how ocean currents are related to changes in water density • the possible impact on ocean currents of the warming of the North Atlantic due to climate change. Note: (i) the reading of vernier calipers and micrometer screw gauge should be left out but only mention instances where these instruments are used; (ii) both digital and analogue clocks should be used if available; (iii) Accuracy and significant figures to be emphasised throughout the whole syllabus, for both theoretical and practical work; (iv) Scientific method should be continuously applied to ALL other topics and sub-topics; (v) The experiment to determine density using the density bottle should not be carried out, though results obtained from the experiment may be used in numerical problems;
