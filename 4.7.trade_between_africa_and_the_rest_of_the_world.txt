Trade between the European Union and East Africa • Explain that the European Union (EU) is a large political block with 27 countries. (NB: UK currently due to leave in March 2019). For trade, the member countries negotiate as one body • Present trade statistics for one or more years between the EU and any one African country. Get a series of questions to analyse these statistics. What kinds of goods do the African countries export to Europe and what kind do European countries export to Africa? • do the above activity obtaining statistics from the Internet. • discuss what benefits this trade brings to the EU and to African countries. • Explain that in 2017 the EU was negotiating a trade agreement with East Africa where the goods from each side would enter the other side without paying duty. Suggest what benefits this would bring to each side. Find out if this has now been agreed. • Suggest the problems this might bring East African countries in developing industries. • In trade negotiations, which countries do you think are most powerful: the developed industrialised countries or the less developed non-industrialised countries? Explain your reasons. Trade between Africa and Asia • What kinds of goods do you buy which are made in Asiatic countries. Refer to prior learning. • use Internet to find statistics of trade between East Africa and Asia. • Refer back to the development of industries in China (topic 27). Why are many Asian goods very cheap (low wages e.g., in China compared with ‘western’ industrialised countries; mass production giving ‘economies of scale’; some goods of very low standard). • In China, wages are increasing: what effect might this have on trade? (Goods become more expensive and cheaper to buy from other Asian countries; China beginning to export more technically advanced goods like mobile phones, computers, televisions etc.,).
