Theme ***Introduction to East Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 8 ***FORMATION OF MAJOR LANDFORMS AND DRAINAGE IN EAST AFRICA*** "26 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands how each of the main types of landforms in East Africa was formed, the main types of rocks and the main features of the drainage. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the main types of landforms and drainage features of East Africa(k); b) understand how igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are formed and how each influences landforms (u); c)understand the process of weathering and how weathered rock particles form the basis of soil (u); d) understand how each of the main types of landform was formed: by rocks themselves or by the rocks being worn away or eroded away (u); e) understand the relationship between drainage and landforms. (u); f) recognize the landforms on photographs. (s); g) locate the examples of landforms on maps of East Africa. (s); h) appreciate that the rocks, landforms and drainage affect the way people live. (v/a, gs); i) understand the main concepts of plate tectonics and how this has led to the formation of the main physical features of East Africa (u); j) understand the characteristics of important kinds of physical features in East Africa, including mountain ranges, volcanoes, plateaus, basins and rift valleys (u); k) study through field work any of the above physical features in the local area (s); l) draw a map to show the main relief regions of East Africa (s); m) recognise physical features from photographs (s); m) understand how their own lives and the lives of their communities are affected by physical features, including natural hazards (u); n) understand through case studies how the physical features affect the lives of people in selected areas of East Africa (u); o) draw diagrams to show the formation of important physical features (s). • In groups: • produce a commentary about the formation of a particular type of landscape and its geology • write a case study on a type of landscape feature such as a river, volcano or lake and how it affects human and physical landscape • debate the merits of living near or on a particular feature, explaining the pros and cons. Types of rock • If possible, look at the three types of rock. Explain that there are three types of rock (Link to work in chemistry): • Metamorphic rocks e.g., slate, quartzite, schist • Igneous/ volcanic rocks e.g., basalt, granite, pumice • Sedimentary rocks e.g., marbel, sandstone, limestone. • In groups, research how each type is formed. Group findings feedback to whole class discussion. • Understand the relationship between rocks and the formation of landforms. Formation of landforms • Are the largest areas of East Africa mountains, plains or plateaus? • Explain that most areas are plateaus i.e., high but flat areas. The plateaus are interrupted by a) mountains; b) rift valleys; c) plains on the coast, each formed in different ways. Structural features • Faulting • Where do most earthquakes occur in East Africa? • Look at diagrams of faulting. If there is a fault or crack, what might happen to the land along the fault. • Explain with diagrams: earthquakes; faults; rift valleys; block mountains. • look at the map of East Africa and ask where the rift valleys and block mountains are: east and west rift valleys and block mountain (e.g., The Rwenzoris). • look for diagrams of faulting on Internet. Vulcanicity • Ask what happens when a volcano occurs and where these occur in East Africa. • Use diagrams and questions to explain volcanoes, including volcanic mountains, plugs, craters, calderas, with examples from East Africa. • list the advantages and problems of living in a volcanic area • look for diagrams and pictures of volcanoes in East Africa on Internet. Warping • Explain that most of East Africa is a plateau. Do you live on a plateau? What is a plateau? – high and fairly flat although cut into by rivers. • Using a diagram, show how the plateau can be warped or sink down slightly in places. • Suggest the possible causes of warping. • suggest where, in East Africa, this has happened most (Lake Victoria basin). Drainage • What are lakes? In what type of landforms are lakes likely to form? (rift valleys and warped basins e.g., Lake Victoria). • What is a river and how rivers form? Where in East Africa are rivers likely to start? (highlands and lakes). • Look at a wall map or a chalkboard map showing main lakes and rivers of East Africa. • copy the map into your books. Erosional features • In pairs, discuss and explain what happens to the soil when it rains heavily. • Understand that each of the types of landscape you have learnt about can be eroded or washed away. • What different forces can erode or wash away the land and rocks. • Through questioning, explore how each of the following erosional forces affects landscape: rain, the sea or lake, ice on high mountains (glaciers). • look up erosion and its effects on landscape on Internet. Erosion by running water • observe any steep slope outside the classroom. What happens to the soil when it rains? Observe a gentle area. What happens to some of the soil which is washed away? • If possible, visit a river or stream and observe it, or ask those who have seen rivers: how can the river wash away the land? What happens to some of the soil washed away? Observe deposition. • If possible, visit a river or a stream to investigate the stages of a river and main features of river valleys or use diagrams and photographs to understand these features: v-shaped valleys, waterfalls, rapids, gorges, meanders, flood plains, alluvial fans, deltas etc.. • look up each of these features on the internet and find related photographs. Erosion by lake or sea • If possible, visit a lake, and observe: • how does the water move? • what causes it to move? • what effects does this have where the waves break? • where does the material on the lake shore come from? • Using diagrams and photos, understand coastal erosion: cliffs, caves, arches, stacks etc. • Using diagrams and questions, understand coastal deposition: beaches, dunes, spits and bars etc., draw the diagrams in your books. Erosion by ice • look at photographs showing ice on mountains e.g., Rwenzoris, Mt. Kenya and answer the following questions: What will happen to the rocks and soil when ice moves? Where will moving ice deposit material? • Using diagrams and photographs, understand to explain glaciations – erosion and deposition;
