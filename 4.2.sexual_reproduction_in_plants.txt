Theme ***Reproduction in organisms*** "@OMD". TOPIC 10.2 ***SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands that the flower is the specialized organ in which all events of a plant’s sexual reproduction occur, leading to the formation of an embryo located in the seed. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) recognise the flower structures that are involved in the processes of pollination, fertilisation, fruit and seed development and outline their functions (k, u, s); b) know the processes of pollination, fertilization and fruit formation (u); c) understand the difference between cross- and self-fertilisation, and the advantages of each method (u); d) differentiate between seeds and fruits structurally and functionally (s); e) understand the importance of dispersal; f) recognise the structures and types of fruits and seeds and relate their structures to their methods of dispersal (u, s). • In groups or pairs, examine specimens and/or diagrams of insect- pollinated flowers, research using different sources, and then discuss: • the meaning of the term pollination and how pollination takes place • how fertilisation takes place • how seeds and fruits develop • Individually produce annotated diagrams explaining these processes. • In groups or pairs, examine examples of flowers that are wind-pollinated (e.g. maize, grasses) and some that are insect-pollinated, and compare the two, especially the stamens/anthers and stigmas of each, relating structure to function. Then compare images or microscope slides of pollen grains from wind and insect-pollinated flowers, again relating structure to function. • Individually produce a table/report comparing the two types of flowers and pollen. • In pairs, research the meaning of cross- and self- fertilisation and produce a table comparing the two. • In pairs, examine specimens and or diagrams of fruits and seeds and discuss and explain (verbally and in notes): • the structural and functional difference between fruits and seeds • how different seeds are dispersed, stating why dispersal is so important;
