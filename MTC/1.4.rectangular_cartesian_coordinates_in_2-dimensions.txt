TOPIC 4: RECTANGULAR CARTESIAN COORDINATES IN 2 DIMENSIONS 15 PERIODS
Competency: The learner plots and interprets points in a range of contexts;
LEARNING OUTCOMES SUGGESTED LEARNING
ACTIVITIES SAMPLE ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
The learner should be able to: 
a) draw and label the Cartesian plane;
(k, s)
b) identify the x– and y-axis. (k)
c) read and plot points on the
Cartesian plane/coordinate grid;
(k, s)
d) complete shapes on a coordinate
grid. (k, u, s)
e) choose and uses appropriate scale
for a bi-variate data set. (u, s, v/a)
• In pairs, play four in a line on a
coordinate grid, recording the
plotted points
• Draw shapes on a coordinate
grid given the coordinates of
one or more
• Collect data (e.g. height and
head circumference) from
your class and plot a scatter
graph;
1. The heights and ages of five girls have been plotted on the
scatter graph;
a) Who is the tallest and how tall is she?
b) Who is the same age in years as Dembe?
c) How much taller is Faith than Joan?
h (cm) scatter graph of height (cm) and age (years)

2. Two vertices of a square are at the points
(2, 1) and (6, 3). What are the coordinates of the other two
vertices of the square?
There are three possible answers. Find all three. Vertices;
