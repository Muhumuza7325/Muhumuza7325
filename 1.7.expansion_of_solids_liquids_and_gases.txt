Theme ***Heat*** "@OMD". TOPIC 7 ***EXPANSION OF SOLIDS, LIQUIDS AND GASES*** "8 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to explain the effect of heat on the expansion of solids, liquids, and gases and explore their applications. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand that substances expand on heating, and recognise some applications of expansion (u, s); b) understand the effect and consequences of changes in heat on volume and density of water (u, s); c) know about the anomalous expansion of water between 0ºC and 4 ºC and its implications (u, k, v/a). • In groups, design, carry out and report on a practical investigation to compare the rates of expansion of solids and liquids. Explain how the expansion of materials is observed and used in e.g., expansion of tyres/balloons, metal bridges, and weather systems, water expanding when frozen/ice forming on the surface of water. Share the results with the class. • In pairs, research, discuss and prepare a presentation on ‘How particle theory can be used to explain how heating changes the volume and density of solids, liquids, and gases’. • In pairs, produce an annotated diagram / graphic presentation, explaining why ice forms on the surface of a body of water and why this is important for life on earth. Note: Gas laws should not be used to explain expansion of gases at this level; Numerical treatment of gas expansion not required; Only simple illustration of gas expansion in everyday life is required.
