[Assignment 1] {In detail, explain the meaning of matter}. All the substances in our surroundings such as water, rocks, living things and stars are all composed of matter. Anything one sees, hears, smells, touches or tastes is matter. The study of matter is important because it guides us to classify substances. Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight. Matter exists in many shapes, colours, textures and forms. Matter is made up of very tiny particles known as ions, atoms or molecules. An atom is the smallest electrically neutral particle of an element that takes part in a chemical reaction. A molecule is the smallest electrically neutral particle of a compound or element that can exist on its own. An ion is an electrically charged particle of an atom or a group of chemically combined atoms after losing or gaining electrons. Most of us, on Earth, are familiar with the four fundamental states of matter i.e., solid, liquid, gas and plasma. At very high temperatures, molecules cannot exist; Most or all of the atoms are stripped of their electrons; This state of matter, a gaseous mixture of positive ions and electrons, is what is called plasma. A plasma is an ionized gas that is a very good conductor of electricity and is affected by magnetic fields. But there are several other states of matter which have been found theoretically and very few experimentally in space and time. Considering all the studies that have been done till 2023, there are 22 states of matter in total. [Assignment 2] {In detail, explain the properties of states of matter including shape, pouring, and compressing}. [Assignment 3] {Define the kinetic theory of matter and use it to explain particle arrangement, inter-particle forces, movement of particles and the properties of solids, liquids, and gases}. Properties of states of matter. To understand the properties of matter, one needs to look at the composition or particle nature of matter. Experiment to investigate that matter is made up of small particles. To the first beaker of a number of beakers filled with the same volume of water, add a spatula endful of potassium permanganate; Using a glass rod, stir to dissolve the crystals; Measure a reasonable amount of the solution formed and add it to the second beaker and stir; Measure the same amount of solution from the current beaker and add it to the next beaker with water and stir; Repeat the procedure until you complete all the beakers. Observation: The colour of Potassium permanganate fades as the fixed amount of the solution is transferred from one beaker to the subsequent one. Conclusion: Solids, one of the four fundamental states of matter, are made of small particles and the number of the particles per unit volume, decreases, as the amount of liquid increases. Kinetic theory of matter. This theory explains the three states of matter. It states that all matter is made up of tiny particles and that these particles possess kinetic energy which causes them to be in a state of constant motion. The extent of the movement of particles depends on the amount of kinetic energy the particles have. The simple particle model of matter, commonly referred to as the kinetic theory of matter, provides a foundational understanding that substances are composed of tiny particles in constant motion. However, it has its limitations: It assumes particles are extremely small, neglecting their actual size. It simplifies particles as solid spheres, which may not accurately represent their actual shapes and sizes, potentially affecting its applicability to real-world scenarios. It overlooks forces of attraction between particles. Its accuracy varies, being most precise for gases and less so for liquids and solids. It relies on ideal conditions, which may not always apply, especially for gases. It disregards small effects occurring at very low temperatures. It lacks a complete explanation for phase transitions, such as solid to liquid to gas. The theory struggles to explain complex systems like large molecules or mixtures. The simple particle model of matter will be explained in detail in your Physics classes. Properties of solids. i) The particles in solids are closely packed and orderly arranged. Figure18.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_001.jpg. ii) The particles in the solids are held together by a strong force of attraction which makes it difficult for the particles to move freely (Solids do not flow). For this reason, solids are hard and strong. iii) The particles in solids can only vibrate within a fixed position making solids to have a definite/fixed shape and volume. iv) Solids have high melting and boiling points. v) Solids have very high density. vi) Solids are practically incompressible. Properties of liquids. i) The particles in liquids are still closely packed but less closely packed than in solids. Figure18.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_001.jpg. ii) The particles have a less force of attraction than in solids. For this reason, they can move from one point to another freely (Liquids flow). iii) They do not have a definite shape and volume but they can take the shape of the container in which they are put. iv) Liquids are slightly compressible. v) Liquids are less dense compared to solids. Properties of gases. i) The gas particles are widely separated with almost no force of attraction between the particles (Gases are free to move in all directions, they do flow). Figure18.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_001.jpg. ii) The particles are in state of constant motion (random movement in all directions). iii) They do not have a definite volume and shape but fill up the volume of the container in which they are put. Plasmas, like gases, have an indefinite shape and an indefinite volume. iv) Gases are easily compressible. v) Gases are very light. Experiments to demonstrate that particles in liquids and gases move. a) Brownian motion. This is the continuous random movement/motion of solid particles in liquids and gases. 1) Demonstration of Brownian motion in Liquids. When pollen grains are poured in water, they are seen to be moving in a continuous random zigzag manner. The movement of the pollen grains is due to bombardment of the particles by the moving particles of water. 2) Demonstration of Brownian motion in gases. When smoke particles are trapped in a glass cell and observed under a microscope, the particles are seen to be moving in a random zigzag manner. The movement of the smoke particles is due to bombardment by the moving gas particles. Video10.Brownian_Motion_setting_up_a_Smoke_Cell.mp4. Or. When a beam of light is directed into a dark room, the dust particles are seen to be moving in a continuous random manner. The movement of the dust particles is due to the bombardment of these particles by gas particles. b) Diffusion. This is the spreading of particles or molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. 1) Demonstration of diffusion in liquids. Place a crystal of potassium permanganate in a beaker of water and watch. After some time, the water turns pink/purple due to the particles of potassium permanganate spreading throughout the water. 2) Demonstration of diffusion in gas. Open a bottle of concentrated ammonia solution and place the bottle at the corner of a room. After some time, ammonia smell will spread throughout the room due to diffusion of the ammonia particles. Rate of diffusion of gases. The rate of diffusion of a gas depends on; a) Density of the gas. Generally, the lighter the gas, the higher the rate of diffusion. This relationship was first observed by Thomas Graham, a Scottish chemist, who compared the densities of different gases and their rates of diffusion. Graham's experiments revealed that lighter gases, which have lower molecular masses, tend to diffuse more rapidly than heavier gases. This is because lighter gases have higher average speeds and kinetic energies, allowing them to move more quickly through a medium. b) Density of the diffusion medium. The lighter the diffusion medium, the faster the rate of diffusion. c) Concentration gradient. The steeper the concentration gradient, the higher the rate of diffusion. d) Surface area. The larger the surface area of diffusion, the higher the rate of diffusion. e) Temperature of the diffusion medium. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of diffusion of the particles. f) Size of the particles. Smaller particles diffuse faster than larger particles. g) Distance through which diffusion occurs. The smaller the diffusion distance, the faster the diffusion. Investigating the rate of diffusion of lighter and heavier gases. Experiment to compare the rates of diffusion of ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas. Figure21.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_004.jpg. Procedure. Soak a piece of cotton wool in concentrated hydrochloric acid and another piece of cotton wool in concentrated ammonia. Insert the cotton wools with concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated ammonia at both ends of the glass tube simultaneously. Close each end of the tube with a cork. Figure22.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_005.jpg. Observation. After some time, a white ring of smoke of ammonium chloride is formed in the tube, indicating that ammonia, a colourless gas and hydrogen chloride, a colourless gas, diffused through some distance before they met (In the process, they collided with air particles that reduced their speed). Ammonia + Hydrogen chloride → Ammonium chloride. NH₃(g) + HCl(g) → NH₄Cl(s). The white ring was formed closer to the end of the tube with cotton wool containing hydrochloric acid indicating that ammonia diffused in air through a longer distance than hydrogen chloride. Conclusion. Ammonia gas (mass = 14 + (3*1) = 17g) diffuses faster than hydrogen chloride (mass = 1 + 35.5 = 36.5g) gas. Video11.Diffusion_in_action_The_reaction_of_ammonia_and_hydrogen_chloride.mp4. Individually, research about what is known about states of matter and kinetic theory, and in groups, discuss where they are observed in everyday life. • In groups, use results from Topic 1.2 and explain them in terms of how matter exists and kinetic theory. • In groups, investigate diffusion in a gas, liquid, and solid using the scientific method • Ammonia, from concentrated ammonia solution and, concentrated hydrochloric acid to form ammonium chloride • Potassium manganate (VII) in water and in a hot gel solution. • In groups, observe Brownian motion and use the particle theory to explain • the properties of solids, liquids and gases and phenomena such as gas pressure, clothes drying, rain formation, and making a cup of tea, and • how diffusion takes place faster in a gas than in a liquid or a solid, and then explain why this is the case. [Assignment 4] {Explain the changes of states of matter and how they involve either heat gain or heat loss}. Interconversion of matter. The importance of any state of matter depends on its capability to change from one state to another. The three main states of matter can be converted into the other when the conditions of temperature and pressure are changed. During the process of change from one state of matter to another, heat energy is gained or lost. Figure23.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_006.jpg. In summary; Change of state from solid to gas is sublimation; Change of state from gas to solid is called deposition; Change of state from solid to liquid is called melting; In a solid, the particles are closely packed and held by strong forces of attraction; When a solid is heated, the kinetic energy of the particles increases as they absorb the heat energy which weakens the forces of attraction between the particles; When the melting point is reached, the molecules break free and the solid changes to liquid; Change of state from liquid to solid is called freezing; Change of state from liquid to gas is called evaporation; In a liquid, particles can move about, but are still held together by weaker intermolecular forces; When a liquid is heated, the forces of attraction between the particles are weakened further until when they are completely broken, and at this point, the liquid changes to a gas [The heat makes the particles move faster until boiling point when particles break free and the liquid turns into vapor]; This is the boiling point of the liquid. Change of state from gas to liquid is called condensation. Examples of substances that sublime include: Ammonium chloride, Iodine, dry ice (solid carbondioxide), Anhydrous Iron (III) Chloride and Anhydrous Aluminium Chloride. • In groups, plan and use the scientific method to investigate changes of state of matter and record observations in a table, e.g., melting a candle wax or ice, boiling water (observe the change of state with temperature), heating iodine or naphthalene. [Assignment 5] {Identify substances and their purity using their melting and boiling points}. A pure substance is one which has distinct physical and chemical properties that are only unique to it. These physical and chemical properties can be reproduced at any time under the same conditions. Physical properties such as taste, smell, and colour of a substance cannot give accurate measurements of purity. For instance, sea water looks like pure water, impure naphthalene has the same smell as pure naphthalene (smell of moth balls), and pure copper wire feels like a wire made of copper alloy. However, the following properties can be used to determine the degree of purity of substances. a) Melting points of solids (constant and the solid melts sharply). b) Density of solids and liquids. c) Boiling point of liquids. d) Freezing point of liquids. e) Refractive index for liquids. The experimental values of the above properties are compared to the standard values and if they coincide, then the substance being investigated is pure. Impurity lowers the melting point and raises the boiling point of any substance. Figure23.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_106.jpg. Note: The experiment for the investigation of purity must be carried out under the same conditions of pressure and temperature, in which the standard values were obtained. Boiling point. Boiling point of a liquid is the constant temperature at which a liquid changes completely into vapor. Boiling takes place when the vapor pressure exerted by the liquid is equal to the external atmospheric pressure. A pure liquid will always boil at a constant temperature, for example, pure water boils at 100⁰C and pure ethanol boils at 78⁰C. The boiling point of a pure substance is higher than expected in the presence of impurities. Experiment to determine the boiling point of a liquid. Procedure. i) The liquid sample is put in test tube/boiling tube with a thermometer held slightly above the liquid. ii) The test tube/boiling tube together with its contents is transferred to boiling water in a beaker. iii) The temperature of the vapour when it becomes constant is noted. This is the boiling point of the liquid. Note. The thermometer is held above the liquid to avoid super heating i.e., a higher boiling point than expected can be achieved if the thermometer is dipped into the liquid sample. Determination of boiling point of ethanol. Drawing of the set up. Figure25.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_008.jpg. Procedure. Place about 5cm³ of ethanol in a boiling tube and add some anti bumping stones. Suspend a thermometer to about 2cm above the surface of ethanol and place the boiling tube in a beaker of water as shown above. Heat the beaker gently and record the temperature at which ethanol boils/the temperature at which ethanol vapour condenses at the bulb of the thermometer and drops back. This is recorded as the boiling point of ethanol. N.B. 1) If the thermometer is dipped into the ethanol, it will be measuring the internal temperature of ethanol instead of the boiling point. 2) The safety tubes allow excess ethanol vapor to escape. 3) A water bath is used for heating ethanol, because; Ethanol is highly flammable (catches fire easily) and cannot be heated directly. The water bath distributes heat evenly (uniformly). Factors that affect boiling point of liquids. 1) Atmospheric pressure. The higher the atmospheric pressure, the higher the boiling point; this is because boiling takes place when the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure. The lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower the boiling point. Atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. 2) Dissolved impurity. The presence of dissolved impurity increases the boiling point of the liquid e.g., water boils at 100⁰C and at a pressure of one atmosphere but water containing dissolved salts boils at a temperature higher than 100⁰C at one atmosphere. Melting point. Melting point is the constant temperature at which a pure substance turns from a solid state to a liquid state under specific conditions of pressure, typically measured at standard temperature and pressure (0⁰C/273.15K, 760mmHg/1atm/101.3kPa). Just like the boiling point, it depends on the strength of the interparticle forces of attraction. Each pure substance has a characteristic melting point at constant pressure. The melting point of a pure substance is generally sharp, while that of an impure substance is broader and less distinct because an impure substance first softens then later turns into liquid but a pure substance will just melt. Impurities tend to lower the melting point of a substance. For example, while the melting point of pure ice is 0°C, the addition of sodium chloride lowers the melting point, causing the ice to melt at temperatures around -10°C to -20°C, depending on the concentration of the salt. Freezing point is the constant temperature at which a pure substance turns from a liquid state to a solid state under specific conditions of pressure. It is commonly determined at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is (0⁰C/273.15K, 760mmHg/1atm/101.3kPa). For example, water freezes at 0⁰C when pressure is 760mmHg. Experiment to determine melting point of a solid substance. Procedure. i) The solid sample is put in a thin-walled capillary tube sealed at one end. ii) The capillary tube with its contents is tightened to a thermometer and put in a beaker containing paraffin. iii) The paraffin is heated with constant stirring until the solid just melts. This temperature is noted and it is the melting point of the solid sample. Note. Stirring is done to ensure uniform distribution of heat so that melting can take place at once. Determination of the melting point of naphthalene. Drawing of the setup. Figure27.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_010.jpg. Procedure. Place some naphthalene in a boiling tube and insert a thermometer in it. Place the boiling tube in a beaker of water and arrange the apparatus as shown above. Gently heat the water in the beaker while stirring. When the naphthalene begins to melt, stir with the thermometer and note the steady temperature at which the solid naphthalene melts. This is taken to be the melting point of naphthalene. Note. 1) Water bath with a stirrer is used so as heat is distributed uniformly to all parts of naphthalene. 2) The water is heated gently to prevent it from boiling violently. Factors that affect melting point. Impurity. The presence of an impurity lowers the melting point of a substance e.g., pure naphthalene melts at 80⁰C but impure naphthalene containing benzoic acid melts at a temperature less than 80⁰C. A mixture of ice and common salt cools faster than pure ice because common salt acts as an impurity which lowers the freezing point of ice. Pressure. Pressure affects the melting points of substances differently. Substances that decrease in volume when melted e.g., water, their melting points are decreased with increase in pressure. But substances that increase in volume on melting e.g., tin and paraffin wax, their melting points are increased with increase in pressure. Graph of temperature against time for heating naphthalene. When solid naphthalene is heated and its temperature recorded after a certain time interval, a graph of temperature against time as below is obtained. Figure28.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_011.jpg. Points and regions on the graph. A is a point at which heating of naphthalene starts. B is the point at which melting of naphthalene starts. C is the point at which melting of naphthalene stops. D is the point at which boiling of naphthalene starts. X is a region where naphthalene exists in solid states. Y is a region in which both solid and liquid naphthalene exists. Z is a region where liquid naphthalene exists. Along AB, the temperature of the solid naphthalene increases steadily as the solid naphthalene is heated. Along BC, the melting point is reached and the temperature remains constant. The corresponding temperature, T₀ is the melting point of naphthalene. The heat absorbed is used to break the intermolecular forces of attraction in solid naphthalene turning it into a liquid. Along CD, the temperature of the liquid naphthalene rises steadily. Along DE, the boiling point of the naphthalene is reached and the temperature remains constant. The corresponding temperature T₁ is the boiling point of naphthalene. Freezing point of naphthalene. When solid naphthalene has fully melted, allow the naphthalene to cool slowly in air while stirring with a thermometer. The constant temperature at which the liquid changes to solid is recorded as the freezing point of naphthalene. Figure29.1.3.states_and_changes_of_states_of_matter_image_012.jpg. A graph of temperature against time for cooling of liquid naphthalene. Points and regions of the graph. P is a point at which cooling of liquid naphthalene starts. Q is the point at which freezing of naphthalene starts. R is the point at which freezing of naphthalene stops. S is the point at which cooling of solid naphthalene stops. Along PQ, temperature of the liquid naphthalene falls. Along QR, the freezing point of naphthalene is reached and temperature remains constant as liquid changes to solid. The corresponding temperature, T is the freezing point of naphthalene. Along RS, the temperature of the solid naphthalene falls steadily. L is a region where liquid naphthalene exists. M is a region where there is both solid and liquid naphthalene. N is a region with solid naphthalene. Video12.The_Three_States_of_Matter.mp4. • In groups, use the scientific method to investigate the heat changes as ice melts and water is heated and cooled, and then produce diagrams to explain why heat is taken in during melting and boiling but given out during condensing and freezing. • In groups, investigate the melting and boiling points of substances, comparing their results with those of pure substances and drawing conclusions about the purity of their samples. Produce tables comparing their actual results with theoretical results and show conclusions and possible experimental errors. [Assignment 6] {Explore what is meant by the cooling effect of evaporation and explain in detail, how the process contributes to maintaining constant body temperature}. Understanding the principles of the kinetic theory, highlights the significance of evaporation in preventing overheating and solidification in preventing over cooling. Heating a substance increases the kinetic energy of its particles, causing changes in state such as from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. When heating a beaker containing ice, the temperature remains at 0⁰C until all the ice has melted, as the added heat energy is utilized to break the forces holding the ice particles together. This gradual absorption of heat without a rise in temperature, known as the phenomenon of latent heat, is crucial in maintaining temperature equilibrium. On cooling water to ice, the water particles slow down and their kinetic energy is then given out as heat energy, which stops the water from cooling further. In this case, latent heat is given out. In land animals, including humans, evaporation plays a vital role in thermoregulation. Land animals often lose water from their skin, mouth and nose by evaporation into the atmosphere. Sweat glands release sweat onto the skin's surface, and as it evaporates, it absorbs heat from the body, effectively cooling the skin and maintaining internal temperature within a narrow and optimal range. This is known as the cooling effect of evaporation. In summary, the body attempts to maintain a constant core temperature through a balance of heat loss and heat gain. By carefully balancing heat loss through processes such as evaporation, radiation, conduction, and convection with heat gain through metabolism and activities such as exercise and shivering, the body maintains a consistent core temperature, ensuring optimal physiological function and comfort. • In groups, use your knowledge of kinetic theory to discuss and explain the importance of evaporation in preventing the body from overheating on a hot day. Effect of heat on substances. The application of heat to substances can induce various reactions beyond physical changes in their states of matter. Chemical reactions may occur, leading to the formation of new substances with different properties. Reactions of heat on different substances will be covered in detail in the subsequent chapters in the classes above. 1) Magnesium: The bright shiny grey metal burns with a bright flame forming a white powder. 2) Sulphur: Put sulphur powder in a test tube. Heat the test tube gently. Sulphur melts and liquid sulphur changes back to sulphur again on cooling. 3) Iodine: Place solid iodine in a dry test tube and heat gently. The iodine changes directly to a violet vapour which condenses on cooling to form blue-black shining crystals of iodine, thus iodine sublimes. 4) Wax: The wax, which is a mixture, melts gradually when it is warmed slowly. When very hot, wax forms white fumes. 5) Sand: This substance does not change on heating, but any water in it may form water vapour. 6) Copper (II) sulphate crystals: The blue crystals contain water, which comes off when the crystals are heated and white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (without water) remains. The white solid reacts with cold water to form a blue substance again. 7) Potassium permanganate: The purple solid decomposes on heating and forms oxygen, which relights a glowing splint. 8) Zinc oxide: The cold oxide is white. It becomes yellow when hot, and becomes white again when cool. No change occurs and the substance is still zinc oxide. 9) Ammonium chloride: The white solid changes directly into white fumes, which on cooling change back to a white solid. No liquid forms, thus ammonium chloride sublimes. 10) Copper: Copper foil or wire is very thin and burns with a bluish-green flame, quickly changing to black copper (II) oxide. We shall get back to these reactions in detail as we progress;
