Theme ***Heat*** "@OMD". TOPIC 5 ***TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS*** "10 PERIODS". Competency; Appreciate that temperature change is a result of heat effects in a body and that daily temperature changes have an effect on our lives. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand the difference between heat and temperature (u); b) Understand how temperature scales are established (u); c) Calibrate a thermometer and use it to measure temperature (s, u); d) Compare the qualities of thermometric liquids (u, s, v/a); e) Describe the causes and effects of the daily variations in atmospheric temperature (u, v/a). • In groups, discuss the effects of heat on substances and use the discussion to explain the difference between heat and temperature. • In groups, draw on prior learning about how thermometers measure temperature and compare the accuracy of mercury, alcohol and digital thermometers as water is heated and/or cooled. • In groups, plan and report on an investigation into the thermometric qualities of liquids; calibrating their experimental thermometers and evaluating the accuracy of the calibration. • In groups, discuss and report on the causes of the variation in atmospheric temperature and its effects to life on earth. Note: Gas and resistance thermometers should not to be discussed at this level.
