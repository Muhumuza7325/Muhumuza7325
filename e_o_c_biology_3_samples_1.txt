Item 3 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: Mrs. Kasuru had been taking her baby boy for routine immunization and the nurses kept on plotting the baby’s weight as a growth curve on the immunization card. On one of the visits, the nurses got concerned and referred the baby to the doctor, who diagnosed the baby with a genetic inherited disease. Mrs. Kasuru could not understand how her baby got the disease since both her and the father of the baby look healthy and normal. The doctor explained to her that the baby’s condition was because of genetic disease.#Figure4.553_1_NLSC_Sample_24_image_004.jpg.#Fig.3 shows growth curve of Mrs. Kasuru’s baby.#Task:#(a) Identify the genetic disease and show how it was genetically passed on to the baby.#Both parents are heterozygous.#Let S represent the allele for normal RBC shape.#Let s represent the allele for sickle cell shaped RBC.#Parental Phenotypes: Normal male Normal female.#Parental genotypes: Ss X Ss#Meiosis Gametes Ss Ss#Random fertilization: Offspring genotypes: SS Ss Ss ss#Offspring phenotypes: Normal Carriers Sickler#There is ¼ chance of producing a child suffering from sickle cell disease.
