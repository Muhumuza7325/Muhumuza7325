Theme ***Mechanics and Properties of Matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 1 ***WORK, ENERGY AND POWER*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; Understand and use the relationship between energy, work done, force, and power in the operation of simple machines. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know that the sun is our major source of energy, and the different forms of energy (k); b) know that energy can be changed from one form into another and understand the law of conservation of energy (k, u); c) understand the positive and negative effects of solar energy(u); d) understand the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy resources with respect to Uganda. (u, v/a); a) know and use the relationship between work done, force, and distance moved, and time taken (k, s); b) understand that an object may have energy due to its motion or its position and change between kinetic and positional potential energy (u, s); c) know the mathematical relationship between positional potential energy and kinetic energy, and use it in calculations (k, u, s, gs); d) understand the meaning of machines and explain how simple machines simplify work (u, s); d) understand the principles behind the operation of simple machines (u, s, gs). ‚Ä¢ In pairs, explain on a poster how the sun is the Earth‚Äôs major source of energy ‚Ä¢ In groups, draw on prior learning to discuss and explain the energy transformations that take place: ‚Ä¢ at a waterfall ‚Ä¢ when a diesel generator is used to provide light and heat ‚Ä¢ when fruit falls to the ground from a tree ‚Ä¢ In pairs, research on the law of conservation of energy and explain it on a poster or chart ‚Ä¢ In groups, research and report on the positive and negative impact of solar energy. ‚Ä¢ In pairs, research on the terms; work, energy, and power and discuss how they are related. Then explain in diagrams the factors that determine the amount of work done by moving masses through different distances, and identify examples of work being done on an object in everyday life. ‚Ä¢ In groups, discuss prior learning about energy and transformation, kinetic and potential energy and create a poster to explain how potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls. Using this understanding, predict and report on the energy changes that take place as a pendulum swings. ‚Ä¢ In pairs, calculate work done (e.g., when a student lifts a weight of 800 N through a height of 10 m in 48 s.) using the equation work done = force x distance moved in the direction of force, and the power developed using the equation: power = work done √∑ time taken. ‚Ä¢ In groups, burn wood, paper or liquid paraffin, (this word is not clear), observe and discuss the reaction and explain on a poster: ‚Ä¢ energy transformation ‚Ä¢ energy loss and conservation ‚Ä¢ renewable and non-renewable energy sources ‚Ä¢ their effects on the environment ‚Ä¢ ways to conserve energy for the future. ‚Ä¢ In pairs, calculate the kinetic energy and the velocity of a falling object e.g., brick of mass 0.5 kg falls from the top of a wall 20m high and hit the ground (ignoring any friction as the brick travels through the air). ‚Ä¢ In groups, revisit prior learning and produce a poster to explain the moment of a force and how machines make it possible to perform tasks using smaller forces than would otherwise be the case, referring to applications such as: ‚Ä¢ opening a door ‚Ä¢ garden tools ‚Ä¢ wheel and axle ‚Ä¢ pulley system ‚Ä¢ inclined plane ‚Ä¢ lever and screw ‚Ä¢ In pairs, use simple equipment to investigate the following and explain using a poster or presentation: ‚Ä¢ 1st, 2nd and 3rd class levers ‚Ä¢ why it is easier to undo a tight nut using a spanner with a long handle than one with a short handle ‚Ä¢ load, effort, and fulcrum ‚Ä¢ mechanical advantage, velocity ratio and efficiency of simple machines ‚Ä¢ power loss and efficiency in simple machines, and how efficiency can be maximised. Note: Derivation of P.E = mgh and K.E = 1/2 ùëöùë£¬≤ is not required, but only the use of these equations in calculating P.E and K.E is recommended.
