THEME ***BUSINESS MANAGEMENT*** "@OMD". Topic 7 ***Production in Business*** "14 PERIODS". Competency; The learner produces quality products for sale. SUB-TOPIC 7.1: HUMAN WANTS*** "2 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) distinguish between human wants and needs (u, gs); c) understand the types of human wants (k); d) appreciate the characteristics of human wants (k ,v). • In groups, discuss the meaning of human wants and needs, and create a table that shows the different types of human wants and their characteristics. This table should be shared with the class, who should agree on the top 10 needs and wants for their class, compared to those of their wider school community. • Consider the link between needs and wants, human rights and the 2030 sustainable development goals. SUB-TOPIC 7.2 ***FACTORS OF PRODUCTION*** "3 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand production (u); b) know the types and stages of production and describe the benefits of effective record keeping (s, gs); c) know the factors of production and their benefits (u); d) make a simple production plan for a given product, including a budget; e) use spreadsheets, books and calculators (s, gs). • In groups, study a range of photographs that demonstrate all types of production. Categorise these where possible according to a range of criteria. • In groups, discuss the types and stages of production, agreeing on the factors of production and their benefits. • In groups, prepare a production plan for a given product and prepare to share your plan with another group for critical analysis, before creating a final version of your plan. SUB-TOPIC 7.3 ***SPECIALISATION, DIVISION OF LABOUR AND DIVERSIFICATION IN PRODUCTION*** "3 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the difference between specialisation and division of labour (u); b) appreciate the types of specialisation (k, v); c) appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of specialisation, division of labour and diversification (u). • As a group, think of companies that specialise in certain products and services. The group then thinks of a product, e.g., a car, and considers how many specialist roles are involved in making a car, and the division of labour. Think of a contrasting product and compare specialisms required. Are there any similarities? • Conduct some research into the division of labour and begin to explain the challenges and opportunities of working in this way. • As a group, identify the advantages and disadvantages of specialisation, division of labour and diversification, using either the example of the car or another one you agree upon. SUB-TOPIC 7.4 ***RAW MATERIALS FOR PRODUCTION*** "3 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know raw materials for producing a given product (k); b) understand factors considered when selecting raw materials for a product (u, gs); c) use raw materials in production (u, gs). • In groups, select a product and discuss how it is produced. Agree upon the raw materials required for producing a given product, and record the factors considered when selecting raw materials for producing a product. Groups explain their findings with the class and then work together in the production of the product, where possible, or explore a further example from a contrasting industry. Groups evaluate each other’s products and the effective use of raw materials. • Create a table of raw products and their uses now and in the past. Consider what uses these raw materials could have in the future, particularly with reference to sustainable development. SUB-TOPIC 7.5 ***MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS USED IN PRODUCTION*** "3 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand the factors considered when selecting machinery, equipment and tools for production (u); b) select appropriate machinery, equipment and tools for production (u, gs); c) use of appropriate machinery, equipment and tools for production (s, v, gs). Get out to a field within your community to identify machinery, equipment and tools used in production. In groups, discuss the effectiveness of the machinery, equipment and tools used and present an argument for and against these different uses to share with the rest of the class. • Conduct some research into machines and tools now and in the past. Consider how and why uses have changed and make some predictions about future uses of these tools, if at all;
