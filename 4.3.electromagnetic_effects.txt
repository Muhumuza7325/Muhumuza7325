Theme ***Magnetism*** "@OMD". TOPIC 3 ***ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should know and understand how magnetic fields interact with electric fields and the applications of this phenomenon. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) investigate the behaviour of magnets and magnetic fields (s); b) understand that a current carrying conductor produces a magnetic field that can be detected. (u, s); c) understand the application of electromagnets in devices such as motors, bells, and generators (u, s); d) understand the difference between a.c and d.c (u); e) know how a.c and d.c can be interconverted using rectifiers and inverters (k); f) understand the action and applications of transformers (u, s, v/a). • In groups, revisit prior learning about the characteristics of magnets, the magnetic fields around a bar magnet and electromagnets. • In pairs, research how to make an electromagnet and use your learning to investigate the relationship between the number of coils and the strength of the magnet, and then make a presentation of your results. • In groups, research, discuss and explain in a presentation how electromagnet technology is applied in an electric bell, a d.c. motor, a relay, a telephone receiver, and a loudspeaker, using circuits to demonstrate principles where possible. • In pairs, research the difference between a.c. and d.c. and prepare a presentation to: • explain how a.c. and d.c. can be interconverted • classify domestic appliances according to whether they operate on a.c. or d.c. • explain the advantages of using a.c. in commercial supplies and why a d.c. motor will not work when connected to an a.c. supply. • In groups, research, discuss and design a simple transformer and show how it works using a presentation or poster. • In pairs, produce a report to explain why transformers are not 100% efficient and how their efficiency can be improved.
