Theme ***Genetics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 11.2 ***VARIATION and SELECTION*** "13 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands that variation is as a result of changes in the genetic make-up of an organism. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) appreciate that variation in organisms is due to external and internal factors, and that mutations can be beneficial, harmful or neutral (k, u); b) identify diseases associated with genetic disorders; e.g. sickle cell anaemia, albinism, and Down’s syndrome (u, v); c) understand the concept of natural selection as a mechanism of evolution (k, u); d) understand the use of artificial selection in selective breeding (u, a). • Do research in groups to explain the meaning and give examples of variation due to environmental factors and genetics. • In groups, research on and explain the significance of: • beneficial mutations • neutral mutations • harmful mutations • examples such as sickle cell anaemia, albinism, and Down’s syndrome. Present the findings to the rest of the class and individually complete reports. • Visit an agricultural facility, or listen to a visiting agricultural extension officer, and/or carry out research in pairs and learn about the use of genetics in plant and animal breeding;
....you should include why humans are still around yet their closest relatives are extinct....;
