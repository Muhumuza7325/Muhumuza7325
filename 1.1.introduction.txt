What is geography? • In groups: • Explore and identify ‘natural’ and ‘built’ features of the local environment by annotating photographs or labelling the environment through fieldwork sketches. • discuss before agreeing the definition of these terms and making final adjustments • investigate, name and categorise features on photographs in different environments. • As a whole class, contribute to a collaborative display of feature names, classifying them as ‘natural’ or ‘built’. • use a range of media: case studies, books, visitor-talks and Internet research, as well as your own work, to debate and agree on what geography means. • discuss the importance of studying geography, using examples from things you do every day, such as collecting water and deciding on when to plant or harvest certain crops. • discuss, identify and list ways that you and your family use the local environment; identify how other people and animals use places in different ways. Discuss the question ‘Whose environment is it?’ and jointly compile an action plan or charter for environmental care for your local area.
