Theme ***Electricity*** "@OMD". TOPIC 4 ***ELECTRIC ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMPTION*** "24 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to describe how electric energy is distributed and consumed in order to ensure electric power saving and safety. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the distribution of electricity from the source to consumer units (u); b) understand the energy transformations in common domestic electrical devices and how energy can be saved (u); c) understand how to use mains electricity safely and know the insulation colour codes used in domestic wiring (u, k, s); d) know the dangers of mains electricity and understand how these may be minimised by safety devices, and by sensible precautions (k, u, v/a); e) know how to read a domestic electricity meter and its significance (k, u, s); f) appreciate the importance of the use of energy saving appliances (u, s, v/a). • In pairs, research how electricity is transmitted from the power station to the consumer and explain using a presentation/ poster: • the advantages of using a.c. in commercial electricity supplies • the dangers associated with high voltage power lines. • In pairs, identify domestic appliances that convert electrical energy into each of the following: • heat energy • heat and light energy • sound energy • sound and mechanical energy • heat, sound and mechanical energy. • In groups, plan, carry out and report on an investigation, using a transformer and wires of different thickness, to find out how the heating effect on the wire is affected by current and the thickness of the wire. • In pairs, research and report on: • the power ratings of domestic electrical appliances, and • their calculations of the cost of the electrical energy per day for each item • suggestions regarding ways to save energy (including the use of efficient, low energy appliances). • In pairs, practise wiring a three-pin plug correctly and research on and explain the importance of the earth pin. • In pairs, research and explain in a presentation and/or a poster: • how fuses and earthing of electrical appliances can protect appliances and save lives • why fuses, switches and circuit breakers are positioned on the livewire of a circuit • safe use of mains electricity • how to read a domestic electricity meter;
