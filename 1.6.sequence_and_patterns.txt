THEME: PATTERNS AND ALGEBRA
TOPIC 1: SEQUENCE AND PATTERNS 12 PERIODS
Competency: The learners explore number patterns and sequences.
LEARNING OUTCOMES SUGGESTED LEARNING ACTIVITIES SAMPLE ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
The learner should be able to:
a) recognise and generate number patterns. (k, u) 
b) explain how to generate a sequence. (u)
c) use number machines to generate a sequence. (k, s)
d) describe a general rule when a pattern is given. (k, u, s)
e) determine terms in a sequence. (u, s) 
• How many different ways can you continue the sequence that begins 2, 4, …? Explain how each sequence is generated
• Make a 1 to 100 number square.
a) Shade in all the multiples of 3 on the number square.
b) Describe the pattern you have shaded on the number square.
c) Sulai wants to shade some multiples to
make a pattern of vertical lines. Which set
of multiples could he use? Find as many
different sets as you can.
d) 3, 6 and 9 are the 1st , 2nd and 3rd multiples
of 3.
i) Which position in the multiples of 3 is 93?
ii) Which position in the multiples of 3 is 3n?
• Put the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... into this
number machine to generate a sequence.
×3 -2
a) Write down the first five members of the
sequence.
b What is the formula for the nth term in the
sequence?
Sharon wants to shade some multiples
on a 1 to 100 square to make a pattern of
horizontal lines. Can she do this? Explain
your answer.
• Draw a double machine that could be used
to generate the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17…


• Write a formula for the nth term in a
sequence starting
1/4, 1/9, 1/16, 1/25.
