WORLD CLIMATES: TOPICS 10 – 11: 24 PERIODS. Theme ***Introduction to East Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 10 ***CLIMATE CHANGE IN EAST AFRICA AND THE WORLD*** "8 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands what climate change is, what causes it and effects in East Africa. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the concept of climate change and its indicators draw diagrams to show the causes of climate change (s); b) understand the possible causes of climate change and how climate change may affect Uganda and the rest of East Africa (u); c) understand the difficulties faced in addressing climate change its effects (u); d) understand possible ways in which local communities and government can reduce the effects of climate change (u); e) use two case studies to examine the possible effects of climate change in other areas of Africa and the world (u); f) form opinions about measures to reduce or mitigate climate change (a); g) participate in tree planting and other activities which might alleviate the effects of climate change in their own communities/school (v, a); h) appreciate the need for people and governments to take actions to reduce the effects of climate change (a, v, gs). • In groups, research the meaning of climate change using different sources and think critically about the definitions before reporting back with the one you have agreed upon. • In your groups, explain the difference between climate change, which has happened over millennia, and the rapid climate change that is currently happening and attributable to human activity. • investigate how some degree of global warming makes this planet habitable – at just the right temperature for us and other life to flourish. • investigate enhanced global warming and its basics and then think of the best questions to investigate this further. Research and question sources and create your own diagrams to show the global warming process and the enhanced global warming process • work in groups, taking on the roles of government ministers with different views about the relative importance of people, the economy and the environment. Some prepare a case for building more roads and cars and burning more fossil fuels, others in the group want a greener economy. Others act as advisors offering some solutions to the effects of climate change. Use newspaper headlines from the region to help you to gather the views. • identify some of the major causes of enhanced global warming and suggest ways and actions that might address it. think about ways to first address reduction and careful use of energy, and then how energy might be produced in more sustainable and renewable ways. research important global agreements and use your new knowledge to discuss why some countries might not want to sign up. • In groups, use photographs, Internet and fieldwork to compare local climate change issues with those in another region of Africa and the world. Think about geographical similarities and differences. • read reports about the effects of climate change on People’s lives and ecosystems. Draw conclusion about how to most effectively mitigate these issues. • carry out fieldwork in and round the school and local community and identify some positive actions that can be taken, mapping them and creating an action plan that can be carried out. What is climate change? • Ask if you have ever heard that the climate is changing. • Ask old people, especially farmers and people who fish, whether they have noticed any changes in the weather patterns or seasons in recent years. • Explain the available evidence that the climate and the seasons in East Africa are not the same as they used to be. Causes of climate change • Investigate the available evidence that climates are changing all over the world and how scientists relate this to the fact that we are sending too many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. • suggest actions by people that cause greenhouse gases to go into the atmosphere and where these gases go. Through brainstorming, investigate why the release of greenhouse gases has increased in the last 100 years. • What happens if you are in a room with closed glass windows on a sunny day? Why do people in cold areas sometimes grow crops in houses made of glass? These are called greenhouses. • Using a diagram and questions from your teacher, explore the effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Compare the atmosphere to a greenhouse. Copy the diagram. Effects of climate change and how these can be prevented • Investigate the main effects of climate change: some places become hotter; some become drier, dry seasons become longer, more rain storms, cyclones or hurricanes and floods. • Explain why climate change is likely to lead to food shortages in some areas. • In groups, discuss and suggest how climate change can be prevented or slowed down. • Explain that most countries in the world have signed international agreements (e.g., the Paris agreement) toreduce the amount of greenhouse gases or heat - causing gases they produce. • look up the Paris agreement or any other agreement on climate change on Internet and summarise main parts of agreement. They find out why these agreements may not effectively reduce climate change. What can East Africa do to help prevent climate change? • In groups, discuss whether East Africa gives off many gases which cause climate change, and the main gases we give off. Then explain your views. • How can East Africans help to reduce greenhouse gases? Reducing the effects of climate change. • In groups, discuss the following actions and suggest the ones which may be most effective in reducing the effects of climate change: Increasing the use of irrigation during droughts and dry seasons; growing crops more suited to drier seasons; scientists breeding special crops which can grow with less water; planting more trees which absorb carbon dioxide. • In groups, prepare and maintain a tree nursery bed. Plant the tree seedlings on school land or in the local community, nurture the trees and write a report on the activity;
