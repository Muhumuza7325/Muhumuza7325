Theme ***Mechanics and Properties of Matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 3 ***STATES OF MATTER*** "10 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to use the knowledge of the arrangement and motion of particles to explain the properties of solids, liquids, gases and plasma. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the meaning of matter (u); b) understand that atoms are the building blocks from which all matter is made; appreciate that the states of matter have different properties (k, u); c) apply the particle theory to explain diffusion and Brownian motion and their applications (s); d) understand how the particle theory of matter explains the properties of solids, liquids and gases, changes of state, and diffusion (u); e) understand the meaning and importance of plasma in physics (u, v/a). • In groups, draw on your prior learning and research to produce a presentation on: • why matter is anything which occupies space and has mass • the particle theory of matter • how matter exists in different states and give common examples of solids, liquids, and gases • the nature of plasma and why it is described as the fourth state of matter • the properties of solids, liquids, and gases, including shape, pouring, and compressing • Brownian motion • In pairs, observe/present demonstrations, research, and report on the factors that affect rate of diffusion in fluids; compare diffusion of liquids and gases (link to transpiration, and osmosis in biology). • In groups, apply knowledge of the particle theory to explain on a poster: • the properties of solids, liquids and gases • why, when curry is cooking in the kitchen, it can be smelt in all parts of the home, even if there are no air currents • why diffusion takes place faster in a gas than in a liquid • In groups, plan, carry out and report on investigations, using the scientific method to explain, using water and ice, the changes of state of matter resulting from heating and cooling. Use the observations to explain why heat is taken in during melting and boiling and given out during condensing and freezing. • In pairs, research, discuss and report on the importance of changes of state in everyday life, including control of body temperature in mammals, rain and the water cycle, cooling drinks with ice and making ice cream. Note: 1) More discussion on plasma and its availability to be emphasised; 2) Cooling curves should not be introduced at this point;
