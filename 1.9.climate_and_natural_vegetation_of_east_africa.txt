Theme ***Introduction to East Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 9 ***CLIMATE AND NATURAL VEGETATION OF EAST AFRICA*** "10 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the main types of climate in East Africa and how the climate influences the vegetation, appreciating this as a natural resource which can be used to benefit the present and future generations. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the characteristics of the climates of Uganda and the rest of East Africa and the factors influencing them (u); b) understand through fieldwork the characteristics of vegetation and how vegetation is affected by the climates (u); c) draw graphs to show the different climates (s); d) draw a map showing the climates and vegetation of East Africa (s); e) recognise and describe a climate from a graph (s); f) recognise and describe types of vegetation from photographs. (s); g) understand through case studies how selected climates and types of vegetation affect the way of life of the people in those areas (u). • recap knowledge to identify the key factors influencing climate in East Africa. • In pairs: • select sources to answer given questions and use research to accurately complete a climate zone map of the region. • add a key to show vegetation. • evaluate another pair’s map and edit their work accordingly. • write your own questions and challenge other pairs to answer them, using their maps. Factors affecting the climates of East Africa • Temperature and rainfall • Revise topic 6 by questioning: why do most places in East Africa have a hot climate? Which places are cooler and why? • Revise by questioning the type of rainfall caused when air gets hot and rises. • Through discussion, explore the most common type of rainfall received in East Africa and reasons why this is so: (convectional because most places are hot). • Through questioning, revise topic 4: When is the northern hemisphere tilted towards the sun? When is the southern hemisphere tilted towards the sun? What will be the hottest months in East Africa north of equator; and the hottest months in the places south of the equator? • discuss and suggest when most rain occurs; at the hottest or coolest time. • In groups or pairs, discuss and suggest other factors affecting temperature: height; other factors affecting rainfall: distance from sea or lake. Types of climate • Look at a climate graph for each type of climate, un-named. Describe the climate from the graph; answer questions and describe type of climate (Use two savannah graphs for north and south). • Show all climatic regions on a wall or Chalk board map. Copy the map into your books. • use climate graphs to describe the following climates and to answer questions related to the climates: • Equatorial Savannah • Semi-arid • Mountain climates • Coastal (similar to equatorial or savannah but very hot due to being near sea level). Vegetation • In pairs, study photographs of each type of vegetation. Describe the vegetation and suggest the type of climate it comes from. Give reasons to support your views in each case. Look for and describe photographs of each type of vegetation on the Internet. How people live • Show a climate graph for each type of climate, un-named. • Explain that traditionally, the way people lived depended mainly on the climate. • For each of the photographs used in the previous activity, suggest how the climate affects the way people in that area live; the types of farming they do, and give reasons to support your views. • Why is it that many people’s way of life is less affected by the climate these days?
