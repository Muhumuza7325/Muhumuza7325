Theme ***Acids and Alkalis*** "@OMD". TOPIC 5.1 ***ACIDS AND ALKALIS*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates the properties and importance of acids, alkalis/bases and salts in everyday life. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Recognise that locally available materials and substances are either acidic or alkaline (k); b) Understand the concept of pH as a measure of the strength of acids and alkalis (u); c) Understand the reaction between acids and alkalis (u, s). [Group Work 1] {Classify locally available materials and substances as either acidic or alkaline}. You most probably have ever heard of the word acid. To many people, the word "acid" is associated with the liquid used in car batteries, known to recharge the battery and cause skin burns. The word acid comes from the Latin Word "acidus" which means sour. But do you know how an acid is related to a base and an alkali? Try to ask yourself, what these chemicals are; Their uses; Where they are found; And why they are a fundamental part of Chemistry. To start! Acids and bases play an important role in almost everything in our everyday life; Right from the digestion of the food we eat; To the function of the medicine, we take; And even to the cleaning products we use. Just imagine a world without them! Without these chemicals, many of the products in our homes today couldn’t be useful; Just take a look at the products in your home; Soap, jelly, toothpaste, almost everything there is made up of these chemicals. And let's always remember and appreciate that naturally, most vegetables contain bases too; It is the bases in these vegetables that result to their bitter taste. By the way, are you aware that the toothpaste we use daily to brush our teeth is a common example of an alkali; Toothpaste is used to neutralize the acid produced by bacteria that remain in the mouth. Video1.Introduction_to_acids_bases_and_salts.mp4. Now, let’s learn first what an acid is. Get your book, settle down and begin writing some notes. Once again, what is an acid? An acid is a compound that dissolves in water to produce hydrogen ions (H⁺) as the only positively charged ions. Don’t worry yet, with time that will be clear. And as we move on, we will get to understand why it is the hydrogen ions that cause acidic properties. First and foremost, a hydrogen atom as we covered in our form one, consists of a single proton and a single electron. And remember, we said that an electron is lost when the hydrogen ion is formed and that for that reason, a hydrogen ion is a proton. Meaning, we can also simply define an acid as a proton donor (i.e., it provides protons or hydrogen ions to a base during the reaction). Now, write this ionic equation below down, go and do research about it. OH⁻(aq) + H⁺(aq) → H₂O(l). We shall cover such equations later on, but the better if the time comes and you are on the frontline. Right from that equation, we can conclude that a base is a proton acceptor. You can see the OH⁻(aq) ions from the base, accepted the H⁺(aq) ions from an acid to form water. That's what is termed as a neutralisation reaction! It must be quite amazing, learning chemistry, in this modern world! But let’s try to concentrate and understand that an acid can be referred to as a mineral or organic acid. Examples of mineral acids (common laboratory acids) include: Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid, Hydrochloric acid, Carbonic acid, Phosphoric acid, Phosphorous acid and Sulphurous acid. These are called mineral acids because they are derived from minerals. Examples of organic acids include: Ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH) found in vines, tannic acid in tea, citric acid found in fruits, lactic acid found in sour milk, Oxalic acid in moss, Tartaric acid in baking powder and Methanoic/Formic acid in bees. These are acids derived from organic compounds; They occur naturally; Did you know there is an acid in the bee sting? Once again, remember that in our classes, we do focus! That’s the only proven way to excel in Chemistry. • [Activity 1] In groups, brainstorm what you know about acids and alkalis and, from personal experience, identify the characteristics of some familiar substances (e.g., the sharp taste of acids such as lemon juice and vinegar, the bitter taste of alkalis such as ash filtrate from banana peel, and the soapy feel of alkalis) and record information in a chart. [Group Work 2] {In detail, cover the reaction between acids and alkalis plus other common reactions of acids}. Let’s now memorize the following characteristics of an acid. a) Acids have a sharp sour taste. b) Acids are electrolytes because in solutions, they are ionic and therefore conduct electricity. c) If concentrated, they can be corrosive. Being corrosive when concentrated means a substance can cause significant damage through a chemical reaction, often resembling a burning sensation. d) Acids change colours of indicators e.g., turn blue litmus paper red. Note: Acids have no effect on red litmus paper. e) Acids ionize in water to produce hydrogen ions; You’re required to get your book and complete these ionization reactions below. Use your knowledge of S1 Chemistry. (Sulphuric acid) H₂SO₄(aq) ↔. (Hydrochloric acid) HCl(aq) ↔. f) [Activity 2] Acids react with reactive metals to liberate hydrogen gas and a salt is formed; The hydrogen ions may be replaced directly or indirectly by a metal. Acid + Reactive metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas. H₂SO₄(aq) + Mg(s) →. Reactive metals such as potassium or sodium or calcium can’t be used as they react violently with dilute acids, making the reaction dangerous to perform; The reactions are fast, explosive and produce a lot of heat energy which may break the apparatus. All metals which are considerably more electropositive than hydrogen (refer to the reactivity series) react with acids to liberate H₂(g) which they displace directly from the acids. Metals that are below hydrogen in the electrochemical series will not liberate hydrogen from acids. Note: Lead does not liberate hydrogen gas with dilute acids. Lead being only slightly more electropositive than hydrogen, liberates hydrogen with only hot concentrated acids. Note: When Iron reacts with an acid, Iron (II) salts, not Iron (III) salts are formed because the more stable oxidation state of Iron is +2. Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq) →. Note: Iron fillings are greasy and don’t react easily; The grease is removed before use by stirring with ethanol or methylated spirit for several minutes; It is then filtered and dried. Now, that is Chemistry! You better be making your own notes. Generally, Metals higher than lead and lower than calcium in the reactivity series can be used to prepare salts on reaction with acids; The acid used is usually gently warmed to increase the rate of reaction. A catalyst (CuSO₄), is used in the reaction between zinc and dilute HCl (a very slow reaction at room temperature). What is a catalyst? Answer that in your book. Note: Nitrates, as we will cover in our next chapter, cannot be prepared using this method because dilute nitric acid being an oxidizing agent, does not react with metals to liberate hydrogen gas expect magnesium. Nitric acid liberates hydrogen with magnesium only when the acid is very dilute. Mg(s) + 2HNO₃(aq) →. Note: When a piece of Aluminium foil is placed in a test-tube containing cold dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid, no reaction occurs; This is due to the presence of a thin, protective layer of aluminium oxide which is formed as soon as the metal is exposed to air, which prevents any reaction; If a piece of the foil is placed in a test-tube containing warm acid, a reaction occurs after a short while; This is because the oxide layer dissolves in the warm acid exposing the metal which reacts with the acid. 2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) →. 2Al(s) + 3H₂SO₄(aq) →. g) [Activity 3] Acids react with carbonates and hydrogen carbonates to liberate carbon dioxide gas, a salt and water. Acid + Carbonate or Hydrogen carbonate → Salt + Water + Carbon dioxide gas. 2HCl(aq) + ZnCO₃(s) →. H₂SO₄(aq) + 2KHCO₃(s) →. Note: Dilute sulphuric acid reacts with calcium carbonate, barium carbonate and lead (II) carbonate at a very slow rate as the resulting salts formed (calcium sulphate, barium sulphate and lead (II) sulphate) are insoluble and therefore tend to form coatings around the carbonates inhibiting further reactions between the carbonates and the acid. The reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and lead (II) carbonate also forms an insoluble salt (lead (II) chloride) which also forms coating, stopping further reactions. Dilute nitric acid reacts with all carbonates to form soluble nitrate salts. Note: Aluminium carbonate doesn’t exist and salts of aluminium undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solutions producing oxonium ions (H₃O⁺) ions that make their aqueous solutions acidic. h) [Activity 4] && [Activity 5] && [Activity 6] Acids react with bases (basic oxides and hydroxides) to form salt and water only. This reaction is called a neutralization reaction. This is because the resulting solution is neutral (i.e., neither acidic nor alkaline). Essentially, neutralization takes place when a hydroxide ion reacts with a hydrogen ion to form a water molecule (H₂O). Acid + Base (metal oxide or hydroxide) → Salt + Water. NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) →. Video6.Setting_up_and_Performing_a_Titration.mp4. H₂SO₄(aq) + FeO(s) →. The reaction between H₂SO₄(aq) and PbO(s) is not directly feasible; Please find out why this and similar reactions are not directly feasible and identify the steps one would follow to obtain a salt of PbSO₄. Use your internet and knowledge from the reactions between acids and carbonates. We shall get to the details of these reactions in our next chapter. i) Acids react with sulphites readily to form bubbles of colourless sulphur dioxide, which has a pungent, irritating smell. Na₂SO₃(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → Na₂SO₄(aq) + H₂O(l) + SO₂(g). So, why don’t we think of how to prepare these acids. Preparation of acids. There are generally 3 methods to get yourself an acid. a) By the reaction between an acid anhydride (an oxide of a non-metal) and water. Nitrogen dioxide + water ↔. NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) ↔. SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) ↔. Phosphorus (V) oxide + Water ↔ Phosphoric acid. P₄O₁₀(s) + 6H₂O(l) ↔ 4H₃PO₄(aq). P₄O₆(s) [Phosphorus (iii) oxide] + 6H₂O(l) ↔ 4H₃PO₃(aq). b) By displacing a weaker acid (more volatile acid) from its salt by a stronger acid (less volatile acid). 2NaCl(aq) + H₂SO₄(aq) →. c) By precipitating an insoluble sulphide from a metallic salt by hydrogen sulphide. (Lead ethanoate) Pb(CH₃COO)₂(aq) + H₂S(g) →. Next is to know the concentration of acids. You really have to put in effort and understand this. Concentration of acids. So, an acid can either be dilute or concentrated. 1) Dilute acid; This is one which contains a large amount of water and a very small quantity of the acid. 2) Concentrated acid; This contains a very large amount of acid dissolved in a little amount of water. Just as simple as that. Now that we know what an acid is, how it is prepared, the concentration, let’s move on to acid strength. Strength of acids. Strength of an acid refers to the ease with which an acid ionizes to produce hydrogen ions. On this basis, acids are of two types. 1) Strong acids; Strong acids are acids which when dissolved in water dissociate or ionize completely to produce free hydrogen ions, i.e., the solution contains a high concentration of hydrogen ions. Note: Dissociation/ionization is the breakdown of a substance into particles which are capable of moving freely in solution. Examples of strong acids include: Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid and Hydrochloric acid. H₂SO₄(aq) ↔. 2) Weak acids; These partially dissociate/ionize in water. Examples of weak acids include: Carbonic acid, Phosphoric acid, Sulphurous acid, Methanoic acid and Ethanoic acid. (Ethanoic acid) CH₃COOH(aq) ↔. (Sulphurous acid) H₂SO₃(aq) ↔ H⁺(aq) + HSO₃⁻(aq). Note: ↔ means partial/incomplete reaction and the reaction is reversible (there is a recommended way to write this arrow, please check it out). Finally, here we are! Still covering our topic of acids and alkalis. Let's move on to the basicity of an acid. What do you think that is? Basicity of an acid is the number of hydrogen ions produced by one molecule of an acid when dissolved in water. Note: Basicity is not always equal to the number of hydrogen ions in one molecule of the acid e.g., the basicity of Ethanoic acid is one (monobasic) yet it has four hydrogen ions, three of which cannot be replaced. And some acids produce 2, 3 or more hydrogen ions per molecule. What are the types of basicity? (a) Monobasic acid. A monobasic acid is an acid which dissociates to produce only one hydrogen ion when dissolved in water; The acid is said to have a basicity of one. Examples of monobasic acids include: Hydrochloric acid, Nitric acid and Ethanoic acid. HCl(aq) ↔. CH₃COOH(aq) ↔. (Methanoic acid) HCOOH(aq) ↔. (b) Dibasic acid. A dibasic acid is an acid which ionizes to produce only two hydrogen ions from its molecule when dissolved in water; The basicity of this acid is two. Examples of dibasic acids include: Sulphuric acid and Carbonic acid. H₂CO₃(aq) ↔. (c) Tribasic acid. A tribasic acid is an acid which dissociates to produce only three hydrogen ions when dissolved in water; Phosphoric acid is an example of a tribasic acid. (Phosphoric acid) H₃PO₄(aq) ↔. We are done with basicity, lets cover something very important. Uses of acids. Sulphuric acid is used in car batteries. Nitric acid is used in the manufacture of dyes, explosives and fertilizers. Hydrochloric acid is used in pickling metals. Ethanoic acid is used in seasoning of food salads (in the preservation of fruits and vegetables). Sulphuric acid is used in the manufacture of plastics, soap, detergents and paints. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach of human beings plays a vital role in the digestion of food. Acids are used in the manufacture of fertilizers e.g., sulphuric acid. Ascorbic acid in fruits is useful to our bodies. Acids are done. However, you need to go and read more. Please use the search option present to get information from selected texts. Now it’s time for us to look at the bases. BASES AND ALKALIS. What is a base? We covered that already! A base is a substance which reacts with an acid to form a salt and water only. In general terms, bases are oxides or hydroxides of metals / an ammonium group. Examples include; copper(II)oxide, CuO. zinc oxide, ZnO. calcium oxide, CaO. magnesium oxide, MgO. or hydroxides of metals and ammonium groups like sodium hydroxide, NaOH. potassium hydroxide, KOH. calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)₂ and ammonium hydroxide, NH₄OH. Base (metal oxide or hydroxide) + Acid → Salt + Water. NH₄OH(aq) + HCl(aq) →. Note: If a solid compound dissolves in water, it implies that the water has caused the solid to split into ions. What of an alkali? ALKALIS. An alkali is a base which dissolves in water to give hydroxide ions as the only negatively charged ions. An alkali contains a high concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. Therefore, all alkalis are bases, but not all bases are alkalis. A solution of a base in water is called an alkaline solution. A solution in which water is a solvent is called an aqueous solution. Examples of alkalis include: sodium hydroxide or caustic soda, potassium hydroxide or caustic potash, calcium hydroxide or lime water, barium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide or aqueous ammonia. All oxides and the rest of the hydroxides are not alkalis e.g., magnesium hydroxide, copper (II) hydroxide because they are insoluble in water. From now and onwards, promise me you will always remember what an alkali is. I want us to cover the next thing. Properties of bases (alkalis). a) Their solutions are soapy and feel greasy or slippery. b) Their solutions are bitter. c) Their solutions turn red litmus paper to blue. d) They react with acids to form salt and water. Video80.Running_a_titration_analysis_2.mp4. e) Alkalis react with ammonium salts when heated to produce ammonia gas, which has a chocking smell and turns red litmus blue. NH₄Cl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l) + NH₃(g). NH₄⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l) + NH₃(g). [This is a test for the NH₄⁺ cation in the laboratory]. f) Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides react with alkalis to form complexes [Complexes formed from Amphoteric hydroxides shall be covered in detail later, when having our practicals]. Zinc oxide reacts with sodium hydroxide to form Sodium zincate (salt). ZnO(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + H₂O(l) → Na₂Zn(OH)₄(aq) [Colourless solution]. Or. ZnO(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na₂ZnO₂(aq) + H₂O(l). Zn(OH)₂(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na₂Zn(OH)₄(aq). Zn(OH)₂(s) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Zn(OH)₄²⁻(aq). PbO(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + H₂O(l) → Na₂Pb(OH)₄(aq) [Sodium Plumbate, Colourless solution]. Or. PbO(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na₂PbO₂(aq) + H₂O(l). Pb(OH)₂(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na₂Pb(OH)₄(aq). Pb(OH)₂(s) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Pb(OH)₄²⁻(aq). Aluminium oxide reacts with sodium hydroxide forming a salt called sodium aluminate. Al₂O₃(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + 3H₂O(l) → 2NaAl(OH)₄(aq) [Colourless solution]. Or. Al₂O₃(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → 2NaAlO₂(aq) + H₂O(l). Al(OH)₃(s) + NaOH(aq) → NaAl(OH)₄(aq). Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) → Al(OH)₄⁻(aq). Individually, research about the other amphoteric oxides and hydroxides and with equations (molecular or ionic), describe how they react with bases, clearly stating observations [In your research, include tetra-amine zinc (II) ion complex and tetra-amine copper (II) ion complex]. Zn²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) → Zn(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq) (colourless). Cu²⁺(aq) + 4NH₃(aq) → Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺(aq) (Deep blue). f) Alkalis precipitate many insoluble metal hydroxides from solutions of their salts. 2NaOH(aq) + Pb(NO₃)₂(aq) → Pb(OH)₂(s) + 2NaNO₃(aq). Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are deliquescent. Sodium hydroxide solution absorbs carbon dioxide from air to form white powder of sodium carbonate. NaOH(aq) + CO₂(g) → H₂O(l) + Na₂CO₃(aq). You have to memorise those properties, just like your last name. Next, Preparation of bases. a) By burning metals in air. 2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s). b) Addition of water to metal or metal oxide. Na(s) + H₂O(l) → NaOH(aq) + H₂(g). CaO(s) + H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq). c) Heating the hydroxide, carbonate or nitrates of metals except sodium and potassium. Cu(OH)₂(s) → CuO(s) + H₂O(l). CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g). 2Pb(NO₃)₂(s) → 2PbO(s) + 4NO₂(g) + O₂(g). Strength of a base or alkali. The strength of a base or alkali is the ease with which a base or alkali dissociates or ionizes. Alkalis are said to be weak or strong. 1) Weak base or alkali; This is a base or alkali which partially dissociates or ionizes in aqueous solution. Ammonia solution is an example of a weak base. It’s characterized by reversible ionization. A weak base or alkali has low conductivity of electricity. NH₄OH(aq) ↔. 2) Strong base or alkali. A strong base or alkali is one which completely dissociates or ionizes in aqueous solution. E.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide. Calcium hydroxide is slightly soluble in water but since it is completely ionized, it is a strong alkali. Strong bases or alkalis are very good conductors of electricity. NaOH(aq) ↔. Uses of alkalis and bases. You must be aware of some uses already, please not them down. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are used in the manufacture of soap. Calcium oxide is used; i) In building industry as slaked lime, in mortar and plaster; ii) In the manufacturing of bleaching powder; iii) And as a drying agent to dry ammonia and ethanol. Magnesium hydroxide is used as an antacid to neutralize acidity in the stomach. And finally, we have bases covered too. Don’t forget to do more research, the more you research, the better. So let us think together. How can we know this is an acid and that is a base? We did cover the properties, but they really don’t seem enough to differentiate the two. If you were to taste an acid, you wouldn’t like it but you would most likely confirm one from their sour tastes. So, what do we use to differentiate these two? Just like indicators you see on the road, we do have indicators too in Chemistry. INDICATORS (ACID-BASE INDICATORS). What is an indicator? An indicator is a substance which shows whether a solution is acidic, alkaline or neutral. The colour change of the indicator depends on the strength of the acid or the base. Some examples of indicators used in chemistry experiments are: Litmus paper, Methyl orange, Bromothymol blue, Bromothymol red, Phenolphthalein, Universal indicators, etc. Figure1.Common_examples_of_indicators.jpg. NB: a) Weak acids turn litmus pink. b) Hydroxide ions are responsible for the change of colour of litmus paper from red to blue while hydrogen ions are responsible for the change of blue litmus paper to red. Hope you had a look at that figure, next is finding out how can prepare a natural indicator in the laboratory. [Activity 7] Preparation of indicators in the laboratory from flowers of red cabbage. In the laboratory, indicators can be obtained from plant extracts especially brightly coloured flowers such as hibiscus and morning glory / red cabbage. The procedure is as follows. a) Collect a handful of the same type of brightly coloured flowers e.g., hibiscus or red cabbage (do not mix different flowers) and using a mortar, crash the flowers thoroughly into a paste and then add a little ethanol to the paste. b) Stir the solution well with a pestle and then filter the solution into a boiling tube. Carefully decant the mixture and keep the coloured solution in a test tube. This solution (filtrate) obtained is the indicator. c) Record the colour of the filtrate. Which type of indicator is this? d) Add the made indicator to various acidic solutions, water and alkaline solutions. e) The colour of the plant extract changes when it is in an acid or in a base. Different plant extracts produce different colours, but each, can be used to identify whether a solution is acidic or basic. It is for this reason, that the extract is called an indicator. Note: When preparing organic indicators, ethanol is used as a solvent because indicators are insoluble in water but soluble in ethanol which is a non-polar solvent. Therefore, the indicator obtained can be used to test for the acidity and alkalinity of different solutions. We now come to the universal indicator. Try to think what that could be! This is a mixture of other simple indicators in solution. It enables us to classify solutions into neutral, alkaline and acidic. The universal indicator is the most useful indicator. It shows the extent of alkalinity or acidity (i.e., in addition to showing whether a solution is acidic or alkaline, it shows whether the acid is weak or strong). The indicator may be available in solution or paper form. If in solution form, add 2 or 3 drops of universal indicator to test the various solutions. Match the colour change of the solution to the corresponding colour on the universal indicator PH chart. Record the colour change and the PH value. That’s it, the Universal indicator. Next is the pH and pH Scale. • [Activity 8] In groups, drop lemon juice into a solution made from red fruit (grapes, red cabbage) and universal indicator solution. Discuss and report on the colour change and how this provides an indicator of acidity. • [Activity 9] In groups, use litmus paper to decide whether a range of solutions (e.g., lemon juice, vinegar, diluted bleach, diluted liquid soap, tea, cola, tap water, carbonated water) are acid or alkali, and record their results in a chart, making note of the final colour. • Individually, record the group result and write an explanation about the level of acidity in each solution. [Group Work 3] {Explain in detail the concept of pH as a measure of the strength of acids and alkalis}. What is pH? pH refers to the degree of alkalinity or acidity of a solution. The pH of a solution is a number which shows the acidic or basic strength of the solution; It can also be defined as the negative logarithm to the base ten of hydrogen ion concentration. That is now science, you will understand that more in your advanced level. Also note that a pH meter classifies solutions as alkaline, acidic or neutral. And on a pH meter, the scale ranges from 0-14. Figure2.The_universal_indicator_pH_scale.jpg. From that pH scale, we should note that. a) Acidic solutions have pH of less than 7. b) Alkaline solutions have high pH i.e., greater than 7. c) Neutral solutions have pH of 7. There are some other important facts about pH. (i) Strongly acidic; This is a solution with the lowest pH value of 0-3. (ii) Weakly acidic; A solution with slightly higher pH value of 4-6.9. (iii) Strongly alkaline (basic); This is a solution with the highest pH value i.e., 10 – 14. (iv) Weakly alkaline; This is a solution with pH value just above 7 i.e., 7.1 to 9.9. Note: When distilled water is added to an alkaline solution, the pH value decreases towards 7, the solution becomes less alkaline. Next, let’s look at the pH values of some common solutions. Hydrochloric acid (0.0). Gastric juices (1.0). Lemon juice (2.5). Vinegar (3.0). Wine (3.5). Tomato juice (4.1). Black coffee (5.0). Acid rain (5.6). Urine (6.0). Rain Water (6.5). Milk (6.5). Pure water (7.0). Blood (7.4). Baking soda (8.5). Toothpaste (9.0). Borax solution (9.2). Milk of Magnesia (10.5). Lime water (11.0). Ammonia (12.0) and. Sodium hydroxide (14.0). • [Activity 10] In groups, review litmus colour charts and note that different shades have a numerical value of acidity and pH. Use this information to add a numerical value to your personal report and compare it with others. Agree on consistency or discuss where there is inconsistency. Now, let’s see how one could measure soil pH. Measurements of soil pH using a pH paper strip. To about 10g of the obtained soil samples, add 100 ml of distilled water. Thorough stirring is done to form a mixture that is left to stand for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, a pH paper strip is dipped into the supernatant and the obtained colour matched with those on the colour chart on the back of the paper strips to determine the pH. What are the significances of pH measurements? a) In the soap industry, it is important to know that the final product (soap solution) is neutral, that is, it must have a pH of seven. b) Soils which are too acidic are harmful in agriculture; This information is obtained by measuring the pH of the soil. Neutralization of excess acid is carried out by adding slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to the soil. c) Various drugs are prepared at given pHs which must be determined. What are the applications of neutralization reactions? a) Soil Treatment (Control of soil pH). The majority of plants grow best at pH 7. If the soil is acidic or alkaline the plant may not grow well. Therefore, chemicals can be added to the soil to change its pH. If the soil is too acidic, the most common complaint, it is treated with a base (chemicals opposite to an acid) in order to neutralize it; Common treatments use quick lime (calcium oxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate). b) Indigestion. We all have hydrochloric acid in our stomach which plays a role in the breakdown food! However, too much acid leads to indigestion; Therefore, to cure this ailment we need to neutralize the acid with a base such as, sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda), or an indigestion tablet (antacid tablet) that contains a base. c) Curing insect stings and ant bites. A bee sting contains an acid; In order to relieve the painful symptoms of the sting we need to neutralize the acid; By rubbing on calamine lotion (zinc carbonate) or baking soda, the acid can be neutralized. Wasp stings are alkaline; hence acid is needed to neutralize and remove the painful sting; Vinegar (ethanoic acid) is often used. d) Waste water treatment. Usually wastes from many factories contain acids; If they are allowed to flow into wetlands or water bodies, the acids will kill fish and other living organisms. Some acidic waste gases are greenhouse gases, and some cause acid rain. The factory wastes are therefore neutralised by adding basic substances such as potassium hydroxide from banana peel ashes or quick lime from limestone. [Activity 11] • In groups, discuss and record your thinking about the following: • Where there is no change in colour, this is the balance between acid and alkali (or a base) solution or neutral point. • Our stomachs contain hydrochloric acid, and too much of this causes indigestion. Antacid tablets contain bases such as magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate to neutralise the extra acid. • Bee stings are acidic. They can be neutralised. YES! Finally, we end our chapter. Next are questions (remember to keep updated for as many questions as possible). Together, nothing is impossible (Don’t miss the next topic);
