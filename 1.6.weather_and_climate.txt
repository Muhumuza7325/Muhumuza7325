INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY: INTRODUCTION TO EAST AFRICA*** "@OMD". TOPICS 6 – 9:*** "60 PERIODS". Theme ***Introduction to Geography*** "@OMD". TOPIC 6 ***WEATHER AND CLIMATE*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the main elements of the weather, their causes and how to measure them. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the differences between weather and climate (u); b) understand the elements of weather and how they are measured (u); c) carry out a project to observe, measure and record the elements of weather, make suitable instruments and visit a weather station(s); d) know the names of the main instruments used for recording the different elements of the weather and how each one is used (k); e) know the terms used for plotting weather on maps (k); f) know the names and characteristics of the main kinds of clouds and rainfall. (k); g) appreciate that people’s lifestyles are influenced by the type of weather and climate (a, v, gs); h) understand the positive and negative effects of weather on their own lives and those of their communities (u); i) draw and use climate graphs of local and other areas to describe climate (s). Weather and climate • describe the weather that day • Primary revision: list all the elements used to describe the weather, including sunshine, wind, clouds, rainfall, temperature, humidity, pressure. • These describe the weather. “What is the difference between weather and climate?” Weather describes a particular moment or day. Climate describes what the weather is usually like. Measurement of weather • Name any instruments you know for recording the weather. • List these on the chalk board and add any not named. • Explain that places where all elements of the weather are measured are called Weather Stations. • visit a working weather station to research the components of a weather station and how they work. Name, describe and practise using the tools and approaches you have seen and make your own equipment, where practical, such as Okta grids for measuring cloud cover and rain gauges. • Show diagrams, or ask to investigate, any weather instruments not seen at the weather station and explain their use. • work in groups, using your collected weather data to create charts and graphs that help to explain daily variations. Groups make a presentation about weather and climate, and everyday life, in their own or a contrasting locality. • Ensure you understand the following key terms: thermometer; rain gauge; measuring cylinder; sunshine recorder; wind vane; anemometer; barometer; humidity; hygrometer; relative and absolute humidity; Stevenson screen. Recording weather • In groups, make any simple weather instruments you can e.g., rain gauge (straight sided tin), wind vane • In groups start a weather diary to record daily weather, either by instruments, if available, or by observation e.g., dry, wet, very wet; sunny, cloudy; hot, warm, cold; wind strong, mild, calm; wind direction (from); thunder/lightening etc. • use simple statistics to record the weather. Recording weather on maps and graphs • Explain and show examples of recording weather on maps by lines, symbols or shading e.g., temperature (isotherms), rainfall (isohyets), pressure (isobars): “lines of equal.......................... ” Elicit ending. • use examples of maps and weather data to do an exercise on based on iso lines. • Practice how to record weather on graphs: line graphs for temperature; bar graphs for rainfall. • Using a set of figures, draw graphs. • keep written/digital weather diaries and a diary of day-to-day activities, presenting these together with an explanation of how weather can influence day-to-day human activity. • work in groups to research and explain how the local climate influences your lives, contrasting this with lifestyles in a different climate zone. Give examples of how extreme weather events and the effects of climate change affect people’s lives here and elsewhere in the world. Clouds and rainfall • Through questioning, revise the causes of rain (Air rises and cools and cool air can contain less water vapour so some turns into drops of water). • Show pictures of cloud types and/or go outside and see clouds as they appear in reality: depends on height, shape and thickness: • cirrus (very high, thin). • stratus: (lower, thick and flat). • cumulus: (low, thick and tall often growing upwards). • cumulo-nimbus (low, thick, tall and causing rain). • look for pictures of cloud types on the Internet. • Types of rain: Explain the different types of rain and what causes rain. Type depends on what causes air to rise: • relief rain: air rises due to passing over high hills • convectional: air rises because it gets hot in daytime • frontal: Two types of air/wind meet and hotter air moves up over cooler air • Ask where and when in local area each type is common;
