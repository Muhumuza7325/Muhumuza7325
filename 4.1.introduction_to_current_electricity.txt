Theme ***Electricity*** "@OMD". TOPIC 1 ***INTRODUCTION TO CURRENT ELECTRICITY*** "18 PERIODS". Competency; should appreciate that electric current is the transfer of charge through a conductor, either by electrons or by ions. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand what e.m.f is (u); b) understand that cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy, producing current and also the force needed to create a flow of current in a circuit (u, s); c) understand that electric cells are very useful but have their limitations (u, v/a); d) understand the nature of electric current, its sources, what makes it flow around circuits and how and it is measured (u, s); e) know that some materials are electrical conductors and other are insulators (k); f) recognise, understand and apply knowledge of series and parallel circuits (k, u, s, v/a); g) appreciate that circuits may be represented as circuit diagrams consisting of an agreed set of symbols to represent components (k, u, s). • In groups, revisit prior learning about electricity, carry out research and explain using annotated diagrams: • the structure of a simple cell and how chemical reactions can produce electricity • the flow of electricity around a circuit powered by an electric cell in terms of both the current / flow of charge and the potential difference created by the cell. • In pairs, brainstorm, research and report on: • common practical applications of electric cells • recent advances in cell technology • applications for which cells are not appropriate and the reasons why • other sources of e.m.f apart from simple cell • In pairs: • research and use diagrams to explain the symbols used in a circuit diagram and the differences between series and parallel circuits • investigate and report the relationship between voltage and the brightness of bulbs • explain the practical implications of this relationship. • In groups, plan and report on an investigation, using an electric circuit with batteries and bulbs, to explore the electrical conductivity of different materials (e.g., copper, wood, plastic, iron, aluminium, graphite, rubber, cardboard, glass, wool). • In groups, plan and report on an investigation using batteries, bulbs, and an ammeter to measure the current flowing through different parts of series and parallel circuits, and then explain why domestic circuits are in parallel. • In pairs, research and contribute to a presentation to explain how an electric current involves the transfer of a charge by electrons or ions;
