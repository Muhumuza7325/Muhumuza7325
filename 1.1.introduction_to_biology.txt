Theme ***Diversity of living things*** "@OMD". TOPIC 1.1 ***INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY*** "8 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands biology as a study of life and that all living organisms experience common life processes. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; Appreciate that; a) biology is the study of life (k); b) biology is applied in everyday life (u); c) life processes are common to all living things, but they are manifested differently in different organisms (u). The 4-year syllabus for biology is one of the 20 subjects of the lower secondary school curriculum of Uganda. The syllabus builds upon concepts, skills, attitudes, and values developed at the primary school level, which provide a firm foundation for further learning of biology. The key change in the new curriculum is a move from a knowledge-based curriculum to a competence and skill-based curriculum. It is no longer sufficient to accumulate large amounts of knowledge. Young people need to develop the ability to apply their learning with confidence in a range of situations. Thus, the curriculum requires an active, learner-centred rather than passive, teacher-centred approach. The role of the teacher is to build on learners’ existing knowledge and experience through posing problems to the learners. The new curriculum focuses on 4 “key learning outcomes”: self–assured individuals, responsible and patriotic citizens, lifelong learners, and positive contributors to society. The curriculum emphasises knowledge, application, and behavioural change. At the heart of every subject, there are generic skills (communication, co-operation and self-directed learning, critical thinking and problem-solving, creativity and innovation, among many others) that allow development into lifelong learners. Besides, there are also cross cutting challenges that are embedded across subjects to enable learners understand the connections between the subjects and complexities of life. Biology is a compulsory subject from Senior 1 to Senior 4. Its syllabus aims to: enable learners appreciate and understand the diversity and interconnectedness of life, as well as the dynamic interactions between living organisms and their environment; make learners aware of the significance of biological discoveries and their impact on human society and the natural world, emphasising the ethical and responsible use of biological knowledge and technologies, using the scientific approach. [Assignment 1] {What is biology?}. Science is the systematic study of the natural world, encompassing both living and non-living things, through observation, experimentation, and analysis to uncover the principles and laws governing the universe. Biology, a branch of science derived from the Greek words: bios (meaning "life") and logos (meaning "study"), focuses specifically on the scientific study of life, encompassing the structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, and interactions of living things (organisms) with their environment. It is a diverse and dynamic field that examines life at multiple levels, from microscopic molecules and cells to complex ecosystems and global patterns. Without any doubt, the 21st century (2001 to 2100) is biology's century, as advancements in biological research and technology are set to transform our understanding of life and address some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. While biology may have been perceived as challenging in the past, recent advancements have made it significantly more accessible. By focusing on its real-world applications and relevance, you'll discover that it can be an incredibly engaging and rewarding subject. Today marks the start of your exciting journey as a biologist, and we welcome you and wish you every success! To begin, what exactly is life? Life can be understood through a series of fundamental processes that define all living things. Observing plants and animals reveals distinct characteristics, common to all living things, known as the seven life processes, that indicate they are alive. These processes, central to biology, form the foundation of the subject and provide insight into what constitutes life itself. Firstly, living organisms exhibit movement in two forms: visible movement, such as locomotion in animals to seek food, shelter, or mates, and subtle movement, such as tropisms in plants, where they bend toward environmental stimuli like light, gravity, or moisture. Second, they undergo respiration, a process of releasing energy from food to sustain life activities. Third, living things demonstrate sensitivity, also known as irritability, responding to stimuli in their environment, such as light, temperature, or touch. Fourth, they require nutrition, obtaining and utilising nutrients for energy production, body growth, and repair, with animals consuming already made food and plants synthesising it through photosynthesis. Fifth, all living organisms exhibit growth, characterised by a permanent increase in size or cell number, often accompanied by development, essential for adaptation, reproduction, and overall health. Sixth, they engage in excretion, the removal of metabolic waste products such as urea in urine and carbon dioxide from the body, maintaining internal balance. Lastly, reproduction ensures the survival of species, with organisms producing offspring either sexually or asexually. Without effective reproduction, species face the risk of extinction. Beyond the traditional seven life processes, modern biology highlights additional traits such as homeostasis, the ability to maintain stable internal conditions, and organisation, which reflects the complex structure of living systems from cells to ecosystems. The capacity for adaptation and evolution over generations also underscores the dynamic nature of life, enabling species to thrive in changing environments. Generally, a thing is considered nonliving if it does not exhibit any of the seven major life processes: movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, nutrition, excretion, and reproduction. However, inconsistencies arise in categorising entities based on these criteria. For instance, while viruses contain genetic material (DNA or RNA) and have the ability to evolve through natural selection, they do not exhibit reproduction, movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, excretion, or nutrition independently. They rely on host cells to perform these functions, including most of their evolution, raising questions about their classification as living or nonliving and highlighting the complexities of defining life based solely on these criteria. The question of whether viruses are truly living or not remains a subject of ongoing scientific debate, and as of 23rd September 2024, there is no single, universally accepted answer. If we struggle to define life on Earth, how will we recognise and understand the existence of extraterrestrial life beyond our planet? However, by exploring the life processes, biology provides insights into the mechanisms that enable organisms to survive and thrive in diverse environments, with practical applications in medicine, agriculture, environmental conservation, and biotechnology to address global challenges and enhance human health and sustainability. Additionally, biology fosters an understanding of ecosystems, biodiversity, and the environmental impact of human activities, promoting conservation efforts and ecological balance. The study of biology also cultivates essential skills, including keen observation, accurate data reporting, and effective scientific communication. It also equips students with practical expertise in handling laboratory equipment and predicting experimental outcomes. Furthermore, biology opens pathways to diverse careers in medicine, pharmacy, biotechnology, environmental science, education, and agriculture, supporting both personal and professional development. Aligning with the life processes, the lower secondary school biology syllabus of Uganda is structured into twelve themes: diversity of living things, soil, nutrition in plants and animals, transport in plants and animals, respiration in plants and animals, excretion, coordination in animals, locomotion in animals, growth and development in plants and animals, reproduction in organisms, genetics, and interrelationships. These themes, in their respective order, span the four years of study, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding biological concepts and their applications. • In pairs, discuss and report on your understanding of the term biology. • In pairs, observe plants and animals, and identify characteristics that show that organisms are living. Identify, research on and record the seven characteristics of living things. [Assignment 2] {Explore the applications of biology in everyday life}. Biology is a practical and experimental science often studied in specialised environments such as laboratories or field settings. The discipline seeks to address fundamental questions such as: What are living organisms composed of? How do living systems function? How do organisms interact with their environment? And, what drives the diversity and complexity of life on Earth? As an experimental discipline, biology relies on precise handling of specimens and equipment, conducting tests and experiments, making critical observations, accurately recording findings, drawing meaningful conclusions, and adhering to ethical standards in the treatment of living organisms and the environment. Note that most foundational aspects of laboratory rules and apparatus will be covered in chemistry under Topic 1.2, Experimental Chemistry. Here, the focus will be on additional items and techniques specific to biological experiments. One of the essential tools commonly used to study biology is a hand lens, which is a convex lens mounted in a frame. Figure1.introduction_to_biology_001.jpg. Typically held about 5 cm away from both the eye and the object being observed, a hand lens magnifies the image, making it easier to examine small details of objects that are small but not too small. Magnification refers to how much larger the observed object appears compared to its actual size and can be determined using the formula: Magnification = Size of the image or drawing / size of the actual object. For example, to calculate the magnification of an object that is 10 cm tall, given that its image appears to be 20 cm tall: Magnification = 20 cm / 10 cm = 2. This means the object appears twice its actual size, which would be commonly indicated by the notation (×2) on the bottom right-hand side of the drawing. While a hand lens is valuable for examining relatively small objects such as leaves, insects, and flowers, it has limitations when it comes to observing finer structures. For more detailed investigations, especially at the cellular level, the microscope becomes an indispensable instrument. Microscopes allow scientists to magnify objects to a much greater extent, with greater resolution (the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects) revealing structures invisible to the naked eye. With the ability to magnify specimens up to thousands of times their actual size, microscopes provide insights into cellular anatomy, tissue organisation, and the complex interactions within living systems. There are many types of microscopes, but for this level, we shall focus on the compound light microscope, as it is the one we use. The compound light microscope is named so for its use of a beam of light and multiple convex lenses to view objects. It is commonly employed in hospitals, schools, and various industries for examining small specimens. Figure3.introduction_to_biology_003.jpg. The compound light microscope consists of several key parts: the eyepiece, which enables viewing of the specimen and magnifies the image from the objective lens; the barrel, which supports the eyepiece and objective lenses; the nosepiece or turret, which holds the objective lenses in position and allows rotation to select the desired magnification; the stage, where a prepared slide is placed for observation; the mirror, which reflects light from an external source through the specimen; the stand or base, which supports the instrument on a flat surface; the diaphragm, which regulates the amount of light passing through the specimen; the condenser, which concentrates light onto the specimen; the arm, used for carrying the instrument; the clip, which secures the slide on the stage; the coarse adjustment knob, for initial focusing of the specimen; the fine adjustment knob, for bringing the specimen into sharp focus; and the objective lenses, which magnify the specimen and typically include low power (shortest), medium power, and high power (longest). The microscope is a delicate and expensive instrument essential for studying biology, so it should be handled with care by always carrying it with both hands, never dropping it, keeping it upright, wiping the lenses only with soft lens tissue, and storing it in its specially designed box when not in use. Magnification is calculated using the formula: Magnification = Magnification of the eyepiece lens × Magnification of the objective lens. For example, if the eyepiece is marked ×10 and the objective lens is ×40, the total magnification would be 10 × 40 = 400, meaning the specimen is magnified 400 times its actual size (×400). Using a low-power objective lens (×4) with the same eyepiece would yield a magnification of 10 × 4 = 40, making the specimen appear 40 times larger than its real size (×40). Note that it is important to ensure the correct use of terminology in titles—'image,' 'drawing,' or 'diagram'—to accurately reflect the nature and purpose of the visual representation. An image is a visual representation of an object created through mechanical or digital means, while a drawing is a hand-created visual representation made using tools like pencils or pens, often reflecting the artist's interpretation or style. A diagram on the other hand is a simplified drawing used to explain concepts, systems, or processes, often with symbols, lines, and labels. Examples of diagrams include flowcharts, maps, schematics, and molecular diagrams. Understanding these concepts of magnification and representation is crucial for effectively studying and communicating biological observations. In addition to traditional tools like hand lenses and the compound light microscopes, modern biology has greatly benefited from advancements in technology, leading to the development of sophisticated apparatus that enhance our ability to study life at unprecedented levels. These modern instruments include electron microscopes that use a beam of electrons to achieve much higher magnification and resolution, confocal microscopes that use laser light to create high-resolution images by eliminating out-of-focus light, fluorescence microscopes that visualise specific structures using fluorescent dyes, phase contrast microscopes that enhance the visibility of transparent specimens without staining—ideal for live cells, atomic force microscopes (AFM) that provide detailed surface maps at the atomic level, and high-throughput sequencing machines that enable rapid sequencing of large DNA volumes, allowing scientists to explore biological samples with exceptional resolution and depth. One of the remarkable innovations in biological research is the use of virtual and computational tools, which enable scientists to interact with and manipulate complex biological molecules, such as proteins, in a virtual environment. For instance, molecular visualisation software allows researchers to enter the three-dimensional structures of proteins, providing insights into their functions, interactions, and potential drug targets. This computational approach facilitates simulations of molecular behaviour, offering predictions on how proteins fold, bind to other molecules, and participate in cellular processes. Additionally, advancements in bioinformatics enable the analysis of vast amounts of genetic and protein data, helping researchers identify patterns, relationships, and evolutionary connections among organisms. The integration of technology in biology is reshaping the field, allowing scientists to tackle complex challenges and uncover the mysteries of life with greater precision and efficiency. Video126.A_light_microscope.mp4. Biology encompasses numerous branches, each focusing on specific aspects of life and organisms, reflecting the diversity and complexity of the natural world. Botany, also known as phytology, studies plants, examining their structure, physiology, ecology, reproduction, and economic importance. It delves into their role as primary producers in ecosystems and their applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. Zoology, on the other hand, focuses on the animal kingdom, exploring animal behaviour, anatomy, evolutionary relationships, and ecological roles. Physiology investigates how different organisms function, covering vital processes such as respiration, digestion, circulation, and reproduction, which are essential for maintaining life. Closely related is anatomy, the branch dedicated to the study of the physical structure of organisms, providing detailed insights into their internal and external organisation. Genetics examines heredity and variation, focusing on the role of DNA, genes, and chromosomes in inheritance and evolution. This field has revolutionised medicine and agriculture through advancements like genetic engineering and genomics. Ecology addresses the interactions between organisms and their environment, emphasising biodiversity, resource use, and ecosystem balance, crucial for addressing environmental challenges. Taxonomy is the science of classifying and naming organisms, organising them into hierarchical groups based on shared characteristics, which aids in understanding evolutionary relationships and biodiversity. Beyond the core branches (botany, zoology, physiology, anatomy, genetics, ecology, and taxonomy), biology includes numerous specialised branches that complement and expand our understanding of life. Bioethics addresses ethical considerations in biological research and its applications, ensuring responsible scientific practices. Cell biology (cytology) studies the structure, function, and behaviour of cells, the basic units of life, and immunology examines the immune system and its role in defending against disease. Microbiology examines microorganisms such as bacteria (bacteriology), viruses (virology), fungi (mycology), algae (phycology), and protozoa (protozoology), often with applications in medicine, industry, and environmental management. Neurobiology investigates the nervous system, including brain function and behaviour, while developmental biology explores the processes of growth, differentiation, and development in organisms. Marine biology examines life in aquatic ecosystems, and entomology, ornithology, and ichthyology specialise in insects, birds, and fish, respectively. Evolutionary biology focuses on the origins, adaptations, and diversification of species over time, driven by natural selection and genetic variation. Palaeontology delves into ancient life forms through the study of fossils, providing insights into evolutionary history. Biophysics uses physical principles to study biological systems, bridging physics and biology. Biochemistry merges biology and chemistry to study the molecular basis of life, while molecular biology delves deeper into the interactions between biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Modern fields of biology include biotechnology, which leverages biological processes and systems to drive innovations in medicine, agriculture, and industry, such as the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and biofuels. Nanobiotechnology merges nanotechnology with biology to create nanoscale tools for drug delivery, diagnostics, and imaging. Stem cell biology investigates the properties and applications of stem cells, exploring their potential in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Genomics focuses on sequencing, analysing, and interpreting entire genomes, aiding in understanding heredity and disease, while proteomics studies the structure and function of proteins, providing insights into cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Environmental genomics explores the genetic composition of microbial communities in their natural environments, shedding light on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Epigenetics investigates heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence, revealing mechanisms behind development and disease. Bioinformatics applies computational techniques from computer science and information technology, along with artificial intelligence (AI), to analyse and interpret biological data, advancing genomics, proteomics, epigenetics and personalised medicine. Synthetic biology combines engineering and biology to design and construct new biological parts and systems, pushing the boundaries of innovation in bioengineering and medicine. Systems biology integrates data from multiple biological levels to understand complex interactions within organisms, and computational biology employs algorithms and AI to model biological systems and solve complex biological problems. Astrobiology is a multidisciplinary field that studies the potential for life in space, investigating how living organisms might survive in extraterrestrial environments and the conditions necessary for life beyond Earth. This includes the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of extremophiles—organisms that thrive in extreme conditions on Earth, providing insights into life’s possibilities on other planets. Together, these and many other branches form an interconnected framework that deepens our understanding of biology, and drives advancements in healthcare, environmental conservation, agriculture, and technology, while also expanding our knowledge of life’s possibilities on other planets. Thus, after studying biology, one can pursue a wide range of careers including being a biologist, an astrobiologist, a biology teacher or professor, a medical doctor (such as a general practitioner, general surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, internist, paediatrician, psychiatrist, ophthalmologist, cardiologist, dermatologist, obstetrician/gynaecologist, anaesthesiologist, radiologist, pathologist, physician, geriatrician, endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, oncologist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist), a nurse, a pharmacist, a dentist, a physiotherapist, a geneticist, a microbiologist, a nutritionist, an ecologist, a conservation biologist, an environmental consultant, a wildlife biologist, a biotechnologist, a quality control analyst, an agronomist, an agricultural scientist, a forensic biologist, a crime lab technician, a bioinformatician, a biochemist, a molecular biologist, a pharmaceutical developer, a zoologist, a botanist, a mycologist, a biomedical engineer, a biostatistician, a policy-maker, a science communicator, a regulatory affairs specialist, a veterinary scientist, a research scientist, an environmental educator, a health educator, a clinical laboratory technician, a marine biologist, an entomologist, an ornithologist, a palaeontologist, a biophysicist, a toxicologist, a clinical researcher, a public health official, a health policy analyst, a laboratory manager, a scientific writer, a wildlife rehabilitator, an agricultural extension officer, a bioethicist, a stem cell researcher, a food scientist, a science policy advisor, a journalist, a lawyer, and a counsellor, among many others. [Assignment 3] {Explore the manifestation of life processes in different organisms}. Life processes manifest uniquely across different organisms, reflecting their evolutionary adaptations and ecological niches. In unicellular organisms such as prokaryotes (which lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles), like bacteria and archaea, and eukaryotes (which possess a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles), such as some protists, processes like respiration, reproduction, and nutrient absorption occur within a single cell. For instance, bacteria can reproduce rapidly through binary fission, while photosynthetic protists, such as algae, utilise sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose through photosynthesis, showcasing energy transformation. In multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, animals, fungi, and some algae, life processes become more complex and specialised. Both plants and animals perform cellular respiration to convert food into energy and grow by utilising specific nutrients and environmental conditions. Both groups respond to environmental stimuli, with animals reacting quickly through their nervous systems and plants responding gradually through growth changes. They also excrete metabolic waste to maintain internal balance and reproduce to ensure species continuity. However, they differ in their methods of obtaining energy and nutrients. In plants, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, enabling them to produce energy-rich compounds and oxygen, critical for life on Earth; they require sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water for this process. In contrast, animals obtain energy by consuming organic matter and rely on complex systems such as the respiratory, circulatory, and excretory systems to sustain life. For example, mammals possess a highly developed circulatory system that delivers oxygen via haemoglobin in red blood cells, while amphibians exhibit dual respiration, utilising both lungs and skin for gas exchange. Plants and animals also differ in movement: plants demonstrate tropisms, directional growth responses to environmental stimuli, while animals exhibit locomotion, the ability to move from one place to another. Fungi, on the other hand, absorb nutrients through external digestion, releasing enzymes into their environment to break down organic matter before absorbing the resultant molecules. This diversity in life processes illustrates the remarkable adaptations of organisms, enabling them to thrive in various environments, from the depths of the oceans to the highest mountains. Importantly, these life processes demonstrate the interrelationships between organisms and their environments; no organism exists in isolation. For instance, plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, which is vital for animal respiration, while animals produce carbon dioxide, which plants require for photosynthesis. This interconnectedness highlights that each manifestation of life processes plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, contributing to the balance and sustainability of life on Earth. • In groups, brainstorm and list what plants and animals need to enable them to maintain their life processes. Discuss which life processes are common to both animals and plants, and any that are different, and record conclusions in a clear table. • You can use a suitable graphical program to design a pond or an aquarium.
