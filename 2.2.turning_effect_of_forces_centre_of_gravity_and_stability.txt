Theme ***Mechanics and properties of matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 2 ***TURNING EFFECT OF FORCES, CENTRE OF GRAVITY AND STABILITY*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to investigate the relation between turning effect of forces and stability of bodies. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the turning effect of forces and its applications (u, s, v/a); b) understand and apply the concept of centre of gravity (u, s, v/a). • In groups, revisit prior learning and research about balanced moments, in order to: • explain the principle of moments using a balance(see-saw). • explain turning effect and the meaning of equilibrium • apply this understanding to practice estimating and determining mass / weight and distance from the pivot in order to balance. • In pairs, practice moments calculations e.g., determine the value of distance, d, if AB is balanced in the figure below (or similar) (refer to the syllabus). • In pairs, investigate and report on how to find the centre of gravity of a lamina of uniform and non-uniform shape and then prepare a report on: • the relationship between the position of the centre of gravity of an object to its stability e.g., a bus, a racing car, etc. • how the position of the centre of gravity has implications for the design of objects • what happens when bodies in stable, neutral, and unstable equilibrium are displaced. Note: 1) Examples on moments should involve one or two pivots/turning points only; 2) Variety of examples and practical activities using a metre rule and a knife edge are recommended;
