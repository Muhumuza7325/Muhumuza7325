Theme ***Consumable Chemicals "@OMD"***. TOPIC 19 ***CHEMICALS FOR CONSUMERS*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates that the products used in everyday life exist as chemicals and some of them can be prepared at home or in the laboratory. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Analyse properties of soap and detergent and compare and contrast the effectiveness of their cleansing action (u, s); b) Evaluate the use of food additives (k, u, s); c) Understand the importance of chemicals in medicine (k, u); d) Appreciate the importance of the chemical industry and its contribution to our lives (u). To start, please note that in this very chapter, we shall be building on what we learnt from most of our previous chapters. To accomplish some of the suggested learning activities within this chapter, you will need prior knowledge of the chapters of chapter 9, Carbon in life and Chapter 3.2, Water. This chapter addresses the significant role of chemicals in everyday consumer products. From salt, soaps, and detergents to medicines, dyes, herbal remedies, and paints, chemicals are integral to the composition of these items. However, it's important to note that not all chemicals added to these products for specific purposes, are beneficial to our health. As such, to ensure consumer safety, the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) is responsible for testing and establishing compliance with specifications and regulatory chemical limits in products such as perfumes and flavours, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, soaps, detergents, and household chemicals. UNBS works in close collaboration with other institutions such as the National Drug Authority (NDA), the Directorate of Government Analytical laboratory (DGAL), the Natural Chemotherapeutics Research Institute (NCRI), among others. Figure344.4.5.chemicals_for_consumers_image_001.jpg. Typically, it is the products of non-natural origin that are most heavily regulated. Modern laws and regulations place a special responsibility on those trading these products to ensure their safety and fitness for purpose. Therefore, in this chapter, we will explore how everyday products exist as chemicals, recognising that while many are produced in industries, some can be prepared in laboratories or even at home. [Group Work 1] {Analyse properties of soap and detergent and compare and contrast the effectiveness of their cleansing action}. Soap and detergents: The history of soap and detergent manufacturing dates back to ancient times, with the earliest evidence from around 2800 BC in Babylon, where a clay tablet from 2200 BC details a formula of water, alkali, and cassia oil. Legend attributes the discovery of soap to Roman women washing clothes in the river Tiber at the base of Sapo Hill in Rome, where animal fats and ashes formed a soapy mixture. Over the centuries, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans advanced soap-making techniques, using oils and alkaline salts. During the Middle Ages, Europe, particularly Spain, France, and Italy, saw soap become a crafted commodity, further refined by Muslim chemists, who introduced new methods and ingredients. The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century marked a significant turning point, with soap mass-produced and widely accessible, while the 20th century introduced synthetic detergents and surfactants, driven by the need for effective cleaning agents during World War I and II, transforming cleaning products. Modern soap and detergent production involve complex chemical processes and a wide array of raw materials, resulting in a vast market of specialised cleaning products. It emphasises effectiveness, sustainability, and safety, with biodegradable options reducing environmental impact and regulations ensuring consumer protection. This evolution reflects humanity's continuous innovation in hygiene and cleanliness. For more details on soap and detergents, please refer to Chapter 9, carbon in life. Video76.History_of_soap.mp4. • In groups, revisit prior learning on the production of soap and its cleansing action and research and interpret data in the form of a presentation on: • the history of soap manufacturing, • the chemical nature of soap and detergent, • the additives in detergent such as biological enzymes and whitening agents, • the preparation of detergents. • In groups, plan, carry out and report on an investigation to find the differences in the effectiveness of the cleansing action of soap and detergent. [Group Work 2] {Evaluate the use of food additives}. Food, especially that which is processed, often features attractive colour, appearance, and smell. Substances added to food to directly or indirectly maintain or improve its safety, taste, freshness, texture, or appearance are known as food additives. Many different food additives have been developed over time to meet the needs of large-scale food production, as making foods on a large scale is very different from making them on a small scale at home. Some food additives have been in use for centuries for preservation, such as salt in meats like bacon or in dried fish, sugar in marmalade, or sulphur dioxide in wine, vinegar for pickling, nitrites in cured meats, and natural colourings like beetroot powder or turmeric. Modern additives also encompass antioxidants like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to prevent spoilage, emulsifiers like lecithin to maintain texture, and artificial sweeteners like aspartame. These additives ensure that processed foods remain safe and in good condition throughout their journey from factories or industrial kitchens, during transportation to warehouses and shops, and finally to consumers. The use of food additives is only justified when there is a technological need, they do not mislead consumers, and they serve a well-defined function. Food additives can be derived from plants, animals, or minerals, or they can be synthetic. They are added intentionally to food to perform specific technological purposes that consumers often take for granted. There are several thousand food additives used, all of which are designed to do a specific job in making food safer or more appealing. Food additives are usually assessed for potential harmful effects on human health before they are approved for use. Authoritative bodies at the national, regional and international levels are responsible for evaluating the safety of food additives. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) is the international body responsible for evaluating the safety of food additives for use in foods that are traded internationally. JECFA, groups food additives into 3 broad categories. a) Flavouring agents. These are added to food to improve the aroma or taste and constitute the greatest number of food additives. There are hundreds of varieties of flavourings used in a wide variety of foods, from confectionery and soft drinks to cereal, cake, and yoghurt. Natural flavourings are concentrated aromatic compounds extracted from sources such as fruits like apples and mangoes, nuts, spices like cinnamon and ginger, vegetables like garlic and onion, and even wine, specifically processed to isolate desired flavours and aromas. They are used sparingly to provide intense taste and scent to food products. In contrast, culinary ingredients from the same sources are whole or ground components added to dishes during cooking or baking, offering a broader range of compounds beyond just the specific flavouring agents. Culinary ingredients are often utilised in larger quantities, contributing to the overall taste profile of the dish rather than solely focusing on isolated flavours. Note that culinary ingredients are generally not considered flavouring agents. Additionally, there are artificial flavourings that imitate natural flavours, such as vanillin (E1510) (an imitation of vanilla), ethyl butyrate (E1514) (a pineapple flavour), benzaldehyde (E1519) (a cherry or almond flavour), isoamyl acetate (E1517) (a banana flavour), methyl anthranilate (E1518) (a grape flavour), ethyl methylphenylglycidate (E1515) (a strawberry flavour), amyl acetate (E1517) (an apple flavour), and delta-decalactone (Not assigned an E number, as it may not be widely used as a food additive in the EU) (a mango flavour), Monosodium glutamate (MSG) (does not have a unique E number, it is typically listed as MSG on food labels) (the natural umami flavour found in foods like tomatoes, mushrooms, and aged cheeses), among others, providing a broad palette for enhancing food experiences. These artificial flavourings offer several advantages: They're cost-effective, deliver consistent taste across batches, have a longer shelf life, and even allow for completely new flavour inventions. However, some consumers perceive them as less healthy, and they may lack the complex notes of natural flavours. Additionally, rare allergies to certain artificial compounds can exist. b) Enzyme preparations. These are a type of additive that may or may not end up in the final food product. Enzymes are naturally occurring proteins that boost biochemical reactions by breaking down larger molecules into their smaller building blocks. They can be obtained by extraction from plants or animal products or from micro-organisms such as bacteria and are used as alternatives to chemical-based technology. They are mainly used in baking (to improve the dough e.g., amylase), for manufacturing fruit juices (to increase yields e.g., pectinase), in wine making and brewing (to improve fermentation), as well as cheese manufacturing (to improve curd formation e.g., rennet). c) Other food additives. These are used for a variety of reasons, such as preservation, colouring, sweetening, stabilising and thickening. They are added when food is prepared, packaged, transported, or stored, and they eventually become a component of the food. Preservatives can slow decomposition caused by mould, air, bacteria or yeast. Sodium nitrite (E250) and sodium benzoate (E211) are examples of preservatives commonly used in food products to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, fungi, or moulds, thereby extending the shelf life of perishable items. Potassium sorbate (E202) serves a similar purpose, particularly effective in acidic food and beverage products. Nitrates and nitrites often work together in cured meats to inhibit bacteria and preserve colour, while sulphites (E220-228) that include sulphur dioxide, act as antioxidants and antimicrobials in dried fruits and wine. Organic acids like citric, acetic, and lactic acid can be natural or added to lower food pH and hinder bacterial growth, as seen in vinegar and some fruits. Additionally, antioxidants like vitamin C/ascorbic acid, along with various others such as vitamin E, BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole), BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene), rosemary extract, sodium erythorbate, citric acid, propyl gallate, and polyphenols, are utilised as preservatives to prevent oxidation and maintain the freshness and colour of specific foods. Video77.Food_preservatives.mp4. Colouring is added to food to replace colours lost during processing or other production, or to make food more visually enticing to consumers. They come in various forms, including natural colours like beetroot extract and synthetic dyes such as azo compounds and triphenyl compounds. Azo compounds, derived from petroleum-based chemicals, are commonly utilised to add vibrant colours to food items like candies, soft drinks, and processed snacks. Examples include Sunset Yellow (E110), which gives a bright orange-yellow colour to foods like snacks, soft drinks, and desserts, Allura Red (E129), imparting a vibrant red shade to candies, beverages, and confectionery, Brilliant Blue (E133), adding a striking blue colour to candies, sweets, and certain beverages, and Tartrazine (E102), providing a bold yellow colour to snacks, soft drinks, and some desserts. Similarly, triphenyl compounds, the aromatic hydrocarbons, also derived from petroleum-based chemicals, are synthetic dyes frequently found in confectionery, baked goods, and beverages. Examples include Fast Green FCF (E143), which imparts a bright green colour to various confectionery products, baked goods, and beverages. Erythrosine (E127) which adds a vibrant pink or red hue to candies, sweets, and certain baked goods, while Indigo Carmine (E132) provides a deep blue colour to confectionery items, baked goods, and some beverages. Non-sugar sweeteners are often used as an alternative to sugar because they contribute fewer or no calories when added to food. Examples include aspartame (E951), sucralose (E956), and stevia (E960). However, WHO has issued a recommendation against the use of non-sugar sweeteners in general, based on evidence that they don’t seem to benefit long term weight loss or maintenance and may increase risk of noncommunicable diseases. Thickening and stabilising agents like xanthan gum (E415), derived from the fermentation of sugars by bacteria, is used to add texture in various foods like salad dressings and puddings. Gelatine (E441), derived from collagen, and acacia gum (E414) (Gum arabic), derived from the sap of the Acacia tree, are also used as stabilisers and thickening agents in desserts, confectionery, beverages, and pharmaceuticals. Emulsifiers are food additives used to blend ingredients that typically do not mix well, such as oil and water. They stabilise these mixtures, ensuring consistent texture and preventing separation in products like baked goods, dairy items, margarines, salad dressings, and confectionery. Common emulsifiers include lecithin, mono- and diglycerides, polysorbates, and sorbitan esters. Emulsifiers enhance product stability, improve texture, and extend shelf life, making them essential in the food industry. Video79.Food_additives_summary.mp4. The safety of food additives. As much as we would like to believe that everything on store shelves is delicious, good for us, and safe, the truth is not always so reassuring. In fact, the food supply in many nations including Uganda, is full of chemical flavourings, additives, colourings, and other ingredients that you may not want to put in your body. While many food additives are deemed safe for consumption within regulatory limits, concerns exist regarding their potential health impacts. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of these additives before consuming them. Information about food additives is typically provided on packaging labels. By reading labels carefully, individuals can identify any additives present in the food and make decisions based on their dietary preferences, health concerns, or allergen sensitivities. This transparency in labelling empowers consumers to make choices that align with their personal values and nutritional needs, contributing to overall health and well-being. Direct food additives are those intentionally added to food for a specific purpose, such as enhancing texture, flavour, or shelf life. These additives are typically listed on the ingredient label of foods, allowing consumers to be aware of their presence. Indirect food additives, on the other hand, are substances that may become part of the food in trace amounts due to packaging, storage, or other handling processes. For instance, minute amounts of packaging substances like microplastics may inadvertently find their way into foods during packaging or storage, although they are not intentionally added to the food itself. Banned food additives. Certain additives have been linked to allergic reactions, hyperactivity in children, and other health issues in some individuals. Additionally, some additives can have adverse environmental effects, such as pollution from manufacturing processes or the release of harmful by-products into ecosystems. Food additives that are potentially harmful to humans and/or the environment have been blacklisted and therefore should not be in food. If food contains such chemicals, warning is always given on the label. Alkyl benzene sulphonate, once employed as a surfactant and emulsifier in food processing to enhance texture and stability, faced a ban due to health risks, including potential carcinogenicity and environmental hazards. Monosodium glutamate/MSG, a common food additive used to intensify and enhance the flavour of savoury dishes, has been a subject of controversy since a 1969 study of mice found that large amounts caused harmful neurological effects and impaired growth and development. Concerns have also been raised about the potential cancer-causing effects of certain food dyes. Red 3, also known as erythrosine (E127), has been shown to increase the risk of thyroid tumours in some animal studies, causing it to be largely replaced by red 40 (Allura Red AC - E129) in most foods. Frequently found in processed meats is sodium nitrite (E250) which acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of bacteria while also adding a salty flavour and a reddish-pink colour. When exposed to high heat, and in the presence of amino acids, nitrites can turn into nitrosamine, a compound that can have many negative effects on health. Exploring the concept of life without food additives often involves considering alternative methods of food preservation, flavouring, and colouring. Natural alternatives like salt, sugar, vinegar, and herbs can be used for preservation and flavour enhancement. However, without additives, food shelf life may be shorter, leading to increased food waste. Moreover, achieving consistent taste, texture, and appearance in processed foods may be more challenging without the use of additives. Video86.JECFA_Evaluating_the_safety_of_food_additives.mp4. • In pairs, collect and interpret data and report on the types of chemicals used in food additives and their functions as: • preservatives and antioxidants, e.g. sodium nitrite, sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid, • flavouring agents, e.g., monosodium glutamate (MSG), aspartame, • stabilizers and thickening agents, e.g., gelatine, acacia gum, • dyes, e.g. azo compound, triphenyl compound, • the use of banned substances such as alkyl benzene sulphonate. • In groups, collect and observe food labels and identify the additives used. Discuss and report on: • the rationale for the use of food additives, • the effect of food additives on health and the environment, • life without food additives. [Group Work 3] {In detail, explain the importance of chemicals in medicine}. One of the major contributions of chemistry is in the healthcare sector, where medicines are developed from chemicals. The creation of new drugs relies heavily on the chemical analysis and synthesis of novel compounds, giving rise to the specialised field of medicinal chemistry. This discipline encompasses the design, analysis, development, and synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs, integrating expertise from synthetic organic chemistry, pharmacology, and biological sciences. When one feels unwell, a doctor may prescribe drugs to help them recover. Medicines can be classified in various ways, such as by the body system they treat, their chemical compounds, or the diseases they address. When classified by the body system they treat, medicines might be categorised as cardiovascular drugs, respiratory drugs, gastrointestinal drugs, etc. Alternatively, classification based on diseases or illnesses, groups medicines as treatments for infections, chronic diseases, mental health conditions, pain relief, and more. Classification based on chemical compounds includes categories such as antibiotics, antiseptics, analgesics, haematinics, antifungals, antipsychotics, sedatives, and antipyretics, among others. Each category contains specific chemical components that are effective in treating particular illnesses. Discovery of medicinal chemicals: There is a long history of plants being used to treat various diseases, as evidenced in the records of early civilizations and even mentioned in holy books such as Genesis. In Uganda, the use of plants and animal derivatives as medicines dates back millions of years, though their discovery is little known due to a lack of evidence. However, the therapeutic properties of plants were described by ancient Greeks and Romans and recorded in their writings. During the Middle Ages, various "Materia Medica" and pharmacopoeias compiled traditional uses of plants. The herbals of John Gerard (1596), John Parkinson (1640), and Nicolas Culpeper (1649) provide insight into the widespread use of herbs. In Uganda, native or traditional medicine has been passed down through generations and integrated with practices from different communities. Natural Chemotherapeutics Research Institute (NCRI), a Ugandan Government Research and Development institute in Natural Products and Traditional and Complementary health systems, has a vision to be a centre of excellence in scientific research and development in Traditional and Complementary medicine. The institute has a medicinal plant garden to conserve some of the common medicinal plants of Uganda. The main objective of conservation is to ensure use of biological resources in ways that do not erode the world’s variety of genes and species or destabilise important habitats and ecosystems. Some of the medicinal plants are: i) Dracaena steudneri, an ornamental plant, used to treat various ailments such as ear pain, malnutrition, among others. ii) Aloe vera, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and antibacterial properties. iii) Aloe ferox, a close relative of Aloe vera with similar medicinal properties but thinner, less juicy leaves compared to the plump, succulent leaves of Aloe vera. iv) Moringa oleifera that some local people refer to as the miracle tree, which can be used in water treatment, and in human and animal nutrition, since its leaves are rich in many nutrients. It is also used to cure several ailments including malaria and typhoid fever. The plant also elicits lactation and boosts the immune system. v) Cymbopogon citratus, commonly known as Lemon grass that has different bioactivities including antioxidant, antimicrobial and antifungal properties. It traditionally treats high fever and headache. And, due to its pleasant aroma, it can be used as a flavour and also as a preservative in the food and cosmetics industry. vi) Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, anticarcinogenic and neuroprotective effects. vii) Ocimum basilicum, commonly known as the sweet basil, has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, anticancer, immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects. viii) The essential oils of Zanthoxylum fagara, commonly known as wild lime, have insecticidal activity. Zanthoxylum fagara is one of the plants used in the Covidex formula. ix) Warburgia ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda Green Heart tree, is traditionally used to treat several ailments including cough, toothache, common cold, stomach ache, fever, malaria, oral thrush and muscle pain. The bark of the tree is preferred for its quite many medicinal properties resulting from accumulation of high valuable phytochemicals during growth. Pharmacologically, its known to have antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, antiplasmodial and insecticidal activities. It is also one of the plants used in the Covidex formula. x) Punica granatum, commonly known as pomegranate, is used to treat cancer, cardiovascular related diseases, diabetes, dental conditions, erectile dysfunction, among others. xi) Catharanthus roseus, commonly known as Madagascar periwinkle, has antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anticancer and antiviral properties. xii) Artemisia annua, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is mainly used to treat malaria. It can also be used as a remedy for fever, skin diseases and haemorrhoids. xiii) Prunus africana, an evergreen tree, commonly known as the African cherry, is used to manage benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, diabetes, malaria, chest pain, gastrointestinal conditions, wound healing and skin infections. xiv) Azadirachta indica, commonly known as Neem tree, is a plant endemic to Eastern Uganda and has antioxidant, wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anticancer effects. These medicinal plants should be harvested sustainably. Sustainability is described as “a system that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Ready materials should be harvested at the right time, with proper harvesting techniques, harvesting equipment and storage to be considered. Herbarium specimens are often necessary since they are highly applicable in taxonomic identification and plant tissue culture can be used for faster production of medicinal plants and/or their products. Plant tissue culture refers to the growing and multiplication of cells, tissues and organs of plants on a defined solid or liquid media under an aseptic and controlled environment. Plant specimens to be used for herbal product development need to be dried to aid grinding and/or long-term storage. Drying can be mainly by sun, shade and artificial heat. The clean and dry medicinal plant materials to be ground are carefully sorted to ensure no foreign materials such as metals e.g., nails and coins, timber, other plant materials and/or insects are present. Presence of such materials interfere with the grinding and extraction processes and even some metals may cause accidents. The obtained plant samples for phytochemical extraction should be accurately weighed for standardisation purposes. Different extraction methods are employed for phytochemical extraction. Extraction is the separation of active ingredients from the sample. The methods of extraction include cold maceration, hot maceration, steam distillation and Soxhlet extraction. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, though hot maceration (which involves boiling the sample in water for about 20-30 minutes followed by filtering or decanting, depending on how the extract differentiates from other material), is often preferred for a wide range of plant specimens. It is recommended to concentrate and dry the obtained extracts for ease of storage. To separate and identify compounds present in the extract, chromatographic methods are used. Chromatography is a method of separation based on the principle where compounds in a mixture applied onto the stationary phase separate from each other while moving with the aid of the solvent system (mobile phase). Chromatographic methods include gas chromatography, Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), column chromatography, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Paper chromatography, etc. To maximise the benefits of herbal medicine, the methods of extraction and preparation need improvement to extract reasonable quantities of active ingredients. Packaging and conservation methods should also be enhanced. Zootherapy, the use of animal products in medicine, has a long history across cultures too, though less widespread than plant-based herbal remedies. Honey, known for its antibacterial properties, soothes coughs and wounds. Bee venom finds use in treating pain, arthritis, and even allergies in some traditions. Shark cartilage, though controversial, is used in alternative cancer and arthritis treatments. Snake venom components are being studied for blood clot and blood pressure issues. Fish oils, rich in omega-3s, address heart health, joint pain, and cognitive function. Snail slime features in some topical creams for wound healing and skin regeneration. Some practices utilise animal organs like kidneys, livers, and hearts for medicinal purposes, but the effectiveness of these often lacks scientific backing. For any herbal product to be allowed for clinical use, it must be safe and efficacious. Determination of the safety and efficacy of herbal products involves pre-clinical and clinical evaluations. Clinical trials in particular are time consuming, require commitment and robust funds. Just like conventional medicine, herbal medicine can affect the body and can be potentially harmful if not used correctly, as herbs contain active ingredients/chemicals from plant parts that can be toxic and cause adverse reactions. Thus, herbal medicines should be prescribed by qualified and registered practitioners. For instance, St. John's Wort, used for depression, can interact with various medications, reducing their effectiveness. Ephedra, used for weight loss, can cause high blood pressure, heart palpitations, and even stroke. Additionally, the misuse of comfrey, which is used for wound healing, can lead to liver damage due to its toxic alkaloids. Always remember that consulting a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy is essential. NCRI collaborates with other government institutions such as the National Drug Authority (NDA), Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) and the Directorate of Government Analytical laboratory (DGAL), to ensure that only safe and effective herbal drugs are made available to the population. Modern medicine: Modern medicine, a revolution in healthcare, offers a vast range of medications (pharmaceutical drugs) to combat diseases and manage pain. These lab-made chemical compounds have saved countless lives by fighting infections, alleviating pain, and controlling chronic conditions. However, medications can have side effects, from mild to serious. Following a doctor's prescribed dosage and duration minimises risks while maximising benefits. Remember, modern medicine isn't a universal solution and may require individual tailoring by doctors. Additionally, it can sometimes work hand-in-hand with alternative therapies, for a well-rounded approach to health. Modern medicines can be classified as: a) Analgesics medicine. Analgesic medicines, commonly known as painkillers, provide relief from pain without causing sleep or loss of consciousness. They are often referred to as anti-inflammatory drugs due to their ability to reduce local inflammatory responses. Most anti-inflammatory analgesics are derived from salicylic acid and phenacetin. Analgesics are divided into two classes: i) Non-narcotic analgesics: These medicines are non-addictive and include antipyretics, which reduce fever by lowering body temperature. The most famous examples of this class of medicine are aspirin and paracetamol. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is widely used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) [such as Panadol, Hedex and others] is used to treat moderate pain, body aches, and fever. Ibuprofen, another common non-narcotic analgesic, is used for pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects. ii) Narcotic analgesics: These analgesics can reduce pain and induce sleep. They are often addictive and are used for severe pain management. Morphine, obtained from the opium poppy, is used to relieve pain after medical operations, cardiac pain, labour pain during childbirth, and severe stages of cancer. Codeine, another opium-derived narcotic, is used for pain relief and to suppress cough. Oxycodone and hydrocodone, synthetic opioids, are used to treat severe pain conditions. Both classes of analgesics play crucial roles in pain management, with non-narcotic analgesics being suitable for less severe pain and fevers, while narcotic analgesics are reserved for more intense pain conditions due to their potent effects and potential for addiction. Video83.Opioids_and_Painkillers.mp4. b) Antibiotics medicine: Less toxic to humans and animals, antibiotics are substances that inhibit the growth of, or destroy bacterial pathogens. Their development began with the work of German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich, and a major breakthrough came with Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin from a fungus in 1929. Video82.Antibiotics_history_penicillin.mp4. Both traditional and modern medicine can treat common illnesses like cough and diarrhoea, often caused by bacteria. Modern medicine benefits from advances in medicinal chemistry, with most modern antibacterials being semi-synthetic modifications of various natural compounds. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics have been developed to improve their effectiveness and combat resistance. Antibiotics can be classified in several ways. The most common method classifies them according to their chemical structure. Antibiotics sharing the same or similar chemical structure will generally show similar patterns of antibacterial activity, effectiveness, toxicity and allergic potential. Generally, chemical classes of antibiotics are based on the chemical components in them and they include quinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides, oxazolidinones, tetracyclines, pleuromutilins, beta-lactams, lipoglycopeptides, polymyxins and cyclic lipopeptides. i) B-lactam antibiotics inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis and include penicillins (cephalosporins, amoxicillin, carbapenems, flucloxacillin cand penicillin G); Examples of cephalosporins (a subgroup within β-lactam antibiotics) are cefoxitin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Imipenem is an example of carbapenems. ii) Macrolides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and include erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. iii) Tetracyclines also inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline and lymecycline. iv) Fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis and include norfloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. v) Sulphonamides block bacterial cell metabolism by inhibiting enzymes and include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. vi) Aminoglycosides also inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and include streptomycin (less commonly used now), gentamicin and amikacin, but are usually injected due to poor oral absorption. vii) Peptide antibiotics also inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis and include bacitracin (applied directly to the skin due to potential kidney damage with internal use). viii) Lincosamides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and are often used for penicillin allergies (e.g., clindamycin). ix) Fusidic acid inhibits protein synthesis through a distinct mechanism than lincosamides or other classes. x) Pleuromutilins disrupt protein synthesis through a distinct mechanism (e.g., mupirocin, primarily used topically). Video81.Antibiotics.mp4. c) Antifungal medicine: Different fungicides are effective against different types of fungal infections. Chemicals used to control oomycetes, which are not fungi, are also referred to as fungicides as oomycetes use the same mechanisms as fungi to infect plants. Fungicides can either be contact, translaminar or systemic. The azole antifungal agents have 5-membered organic rings that contain either 2 or 3 nitrogen molecules (the imidazoles and the triazoles respectively). The clinically useful imidazoles are clotrimazole, miconazole and ketoconazole. Two important triazoles are itraconazole and fluconazole. Athletes foot, ring worm and candidiasis are some of the common fungal infections. Athlete's Foot is typically treated with topical (applied to the skin) over-the-counter (OTC) azole antifungals like clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF), miconazole (Micatin), or terbinafine (Lamisil AT). In severe cases, a prescription-strength topical or oral medication might be needed. Similar to athlete's foot, topical OTC azoles like clotrimazole or miconazole are often the first line of defence for ring worm. Prescription-strength topical or oral antifungals, such as terbinafine or griseofulvin, may be necessary for stubborn cases or scalp infections. Topical or oral azole antifungals like clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin are commonly used for candidiasis (thrush). For severe or recurring cases, fluconazole (Diflucan) might be prescribed. Note that similar to antibiotics, overuse of fungicides can lead to resistance in fungal strains. d) Psychotherapeutic medicine. Mood and behaviour changes can be a sign of mental illness. Emotional and mental disorders for example depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are treated with psychotherapeutical medicine. Psychotherapeutical medicine can be grouped into simulants, depressants and antidepressants. i) Stimulant medicine: Stimulants, sometimes called "uppers," temporarily increase alertness and energy levels. Prescription stimulants are primarily used for conditions like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to increase focus and attention in children and adolescents, not typically used for general mental illness in adults. Street drugs like cocaine and amphetamines are stimulants with a high risk of addiction and other health problems. Energy drinks often contain caffeine, a mild stimulant, but their effect on mental health is limited. ii) Depressants medicine: Fear, anxiety and stress are some of the common conditions that cause serious mental effects. The conditions can lead to sleep disorders and eventually mental breakdown. Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants are medicine that include sedatives, tranquilisers and hypnotics. Drugs that slow down brain activity, and therefore useful in treating anxiety, panic, acute stress reactions, and sleep disorders are called depressant medicine. Depressant medicine can be categorised as: a) Tranquilisers or antipsychotics: These are not technically depressants, but they help manage symptoms of psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) in conditions like schizophrenia. Examples include Zyprexa, Seroquel, Haldol. b) Benzodiazepines (Benzos) such as xanax, klonopin, halcion and librium, can be helpful for short-term anxiety relief but have a high risk of dependence and addiction. They work by enhancing the effects of a calming neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. c) Barbiturates such as amytal, numbutal and seconal, another class of depressants, were once used as sedatives and sleeping pills but are rarely prescribed today due to their even higher risk of addiction and overdose. Note that long-term use of any depressant medication carries significant risks. iii) Antidepressants: These improve mood and regulate neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Many different antidepressants exist, each working in slightly different ways. Generally, antidepressants affect how these neurotransmitters function in the brain. Common antidepressant examples include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/SSRIs (Zoloft, Prozac), Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors/SNRIs (Cymbalta, Effexor), Tricyclic Antidepressants/TCAs (Elavil) and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/MAOIs (Nardil). Note that for a more comprehensive treatment approach, medication is often used alongside psychotherapy (talk therapy). e) Antiseptics and Disinfectants. Antiseptics are chemicals that prevent the growth or kill the microorganisms without harming the living tissues. They can be applied to wounds, cuts, and infected skin surfaces, etc. They are also used in deodorants, mouthwashes and mouth fresheners to reduce unpleasant odours caused by bacterial decomposition in the body. The basic difference between antiseptics and disinfectants is that an antiseptic is applied to living cells, while disinfectants are applied to non-living surfaces to kill germs. A commonly used antiseptic is Dettol, a mixture of chloroxylenol and terpineol. Chlorine and phenol solutions are also known as disinfectants. Chemical components in antiseptics include alcohols, chlorhexidine, hypochlorites, anibacterial dyes, inorganic iodine compounds, halogenated phenol derivatives and quinoline derivatives. Chemical components in disinfectants include alcohols, chlorine and chlorine compounds, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, lodophors, ortho-phthaladehyde and peracetic acid.

Reports should also focus on the side effects of modern and traditional medicines, and the importance of the correct usage of modern and traditional medicines. [Group Work 4] {In detail, explain the importance of the chemical industry and its contribution to our lives}. Importance and contribution of the chemical industry. In summary, chemical science stands as a cornerstone of human civilisation, offering profound contributions across various domains. Through its understanding and manipulation of chemical molecules, it governs the tastes, scents, appearances, and functionalities of countless everyday items. From the flavours we savour to the fabrics we wear, from the energy that powers our homes and vehicles to the distribution of natural resources, chemistry intricately weaves itself into the fabric of our existence. The chemical industry, a vital player in this landscape, produces an array of products, indispensable to individuals and other industries alike. Its economic significance cannot be overstated, as it fuels the sustainable development of national economies and underpins the economic progress of nations. Beyond its economic impact, chemistry's influence extends far and wide, touching upon diverse realms such as environmental sustainability and political stability. Indeed, the chemical industry is a linchpin of societal progress, catalysing advancements in agriculture, healthcare, consumer goods, and beyond. It serves as a beacon of innovation, synthesising crop-enhancing chemicals to bolster food security, developing life-saving pharmaceuticals and pesticides, and pioneering materials like plastics and synthetic fibres that find applications in both industrial and consumer realms. In the modern industrialized economy, the chemical sector occupies a central position, fostering high-tech industries across a spectrum of fields. From agricultural chemicals to electronics, from pharmaceuticals to plastics, its reach knows few bounds. Yet, alongside its remarkable achievements, the industry grapples with environmental challenges. Chemical manufacturing processes can yield pollutants, and certain products may pose risks if not managed responsibly. However, the industry is increasingly embracing sustainable practices to mitigate its environmental impact. Concepts like green chemistry and cleaner production methods are gaining traction, aiming to minimise pollution and resource consumption. Additionally, a shift towards responsible chemical management throughout the product lifecycle is underway, emphasising accountability and stewardship. In essence, while the chemical industry navigates challenges, its role as a driver of progress remains indisputable. By marrying scientific innovation with responsible stewardship, it continues to shape a future where human needs are met without compromising the health of the planet.
