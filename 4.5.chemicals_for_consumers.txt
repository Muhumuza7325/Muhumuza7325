Theme ***Consumable Chemicals "@OMD"***. TOPIC 19 ***CHEMICALS FOR CONSUMERS*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates that the products used in everyday life exist as chemicals and some of them can be prepared at home or in the laboratory. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Analyse properties of soap and detergent and compare and contrast the effectiveness of their
cleansing action (u, s); b) Evaluate the use of food additives (k, u, s); c) Understand the importance of chemicals in medicine (k, u); d) Appreciate the importance of the chemical industry and its contribution to our lives (u). • In groups, revisit prior learning on the production of soap and its cleansing action
and research and interpret data in the form of a presentation on: • the history of soap manufacturing, • the chemical nature of soap and detergent, • the additives in detergent such as biological enzymes and whitening agents, • the preparation of detergents. • In groups, plan, carry out and report on an investigation to find the differences in the effectiveness of the cleansing action of soap and detergent. • In pairs, collect and interpret data and report on the types of chemicals used in
food additives and their functions as: • preservatives and antioxidants, e.g. sodium nitrite, sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid, • flavouring agents, e.g., monosodium glutamate (MSG), aspartame, • stabilizers and thickening agents, e.g.,
gelatine, acacia gum, • dyes, e.g. azo compound, triphenyl compound, • the use of banned substances such as alkyl benzene sulphonate. • In groups, collect and observe food labels and identify the additives used. Discuss and report on: • the rationale for the use of food additives, • the effect of food additives on health and the environment, • life without food additives. • In groups, carry out research
and prepare a presentation on types and functions of chemicals used in medicine, e.g., • traditional medicines derived from plants and animals, • analgesics such as aspirin, paracetamol, and codeine, • antibiotics such as penicillin and streptomycin, • psychotherapeutic medicine such as stimulants, antidepressants, and
antipsychotics. Reports should also focus on the side effects of modern and traditional medicines, and the importance of the correct usage of modern and traditional medicines. • In groups, carry out research and prepare a presentation on chemicals that have had a significant impact on humanity: • discovery of chemicals that improve the quality of life, such as antibiotics and detergent, • side effects of chemicals on life and the environment. • In pairs, research and report on good practice and common traits among scientists in carrying out research, such as patience, meticulousness, and perseverance.
