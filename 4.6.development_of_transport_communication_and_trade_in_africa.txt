Competency; The learner understands the main forms of transport and communication and trade in Africa; and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) use maps to show the major transport routes (s, gs); b) understand the role of the different types of transport in development (u); c) use photographs to identify the different types/modes of transport (s); d) appreciate the importance of transport in national and regional development (v, a); e) understand the difference between internal transport, inter-African transport and international transport (u); f) understand how the main forms of transport used for international journeys are different from those used in inter- African and internal transport (u); g) know the characteristics of the main forms of inter-African transport (k); h) appreciate the advantages, disadvantages and uses of the main forms of inter- African transport (v, a, gs); i) understand the development of water transport in Africa (u); j) understand why inter-African transport is less developed than transport between Africa and the rest of the world (u); k) know the main forms of international transport (k); l) understand the main forms of trade in Africa: internal, inter-African and international (u); m) understand the trade patterns of the selected countries and the factors influencing them (u); n) understand the contributions of trade to the development of the selected countries (s); o) use flow charts, statistics and maps to show trade patterns (s); p) understand the main forms of international communications (u); q) understand how the Internet has transformed international communication (u); r) use statistics flow charts, maps and graphs to analyse trade in African countries (s, gs); s) appreciate the importance of promoting inter African transport and communication to promote African unity and trade (v, a, gs). Transport in Africa • Use a map showing the main railways, important inter-African roads, main navigable waterways, main international airports and main ports of Africa. (show only the very important ones). • In pairs, make a table from the map, showing type of transport, the places it links, and countries linked. • suggest reasons for this pattern of transport: • transport developed by colonial powers which were more interested in exporting raw materials outside Africa and importing industrial goods than inter-African trade. • transport networks mainly developed within each country’s borders or within countries linked politically e.g., East Africa or southern Africa. • different colonial powers introduced railways with different gauges • many African countries produce the same kinds of goods, so there is no need for trade with one another. • Through discussion, assist each other to explore the physical problems that affect transport in Africa e.g., in Congo. • Which types of transport are likely to be important for inter-African trade (road and air, and rail in some places). Which types of transport are important for international trade outside Africa? (ship and air). • Suggest the usefulness and advantages of developing inland water transport e.g., on Congo River. What is the importance of developing ports in Africa. The role of China in developing African transport • use the Internet to look up: China: building railways in Africa. • Refer back to Chinese investment in large-scale projects in Africa (topic 30). • Explain Chinese investment in railways in Africa: the Tanzam railway in 1970s and the East African Standard gauge railway today. • Suggest the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese investment in railways in Africa. Trade in Africa • From previous knowledge, list the main forms of trade: inter-African and international. Explain why international trade is more important to most African countries than inter-African trade • Use an example of trade statistics of two African countries and draw a suitable graph or diagram to represent the statistical information. Use the graph or diagram you have drawn to comment on the trade. • Find on the Internet trade statistics for two African countries and compare the trade. • In groups, discuss and explain the problems facing inter-African trade. Identify the advantages and disadvantages of developing more inter-African trade. Communications in Africa • Revision: List the main forms of communication in the past and today. • How would you communicate with people in other African countries? • suggest the changes in communication brought about by the Internet and social media. How has this helped Africa? • Explain whether and how the internet will improve trade within Africa and back this up with reasons.
