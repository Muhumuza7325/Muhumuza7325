Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand that elements can be grouped into metals and non-metals and relate the physical properties of metals and non-metals to their uses (k, u, s); b) Know that the Periodic table is a classification of elements according to their atomic or proton number (k); c) Relate the arrangement of electrons in the first 20 elements to their positions in the Periodic table (u, s); d) Understand the relationship between the position of elements in groups and the charge on the ions that they form (u). [Assignment 1] {Familiarise yourself with the history of the Periodic table and the table itself and identify that the modern periodic table is a classification of elements according to their atomic or proton number}. Dobereiner and Newlands in the 1800s were the first scientists who attempted to come up with some sort of classification of elements known by that time. They devised the Law of Triads and the Law of Octaves. The modern periodic table is a table of elements arranged in order of increasing atomic number. It was developed in order to put together elements with similar chemical properties. The first periodic table was developed by a Russian scientist called Dmitri Mendeleev in the early 19th century. Mendeleev classified all the elements according to their mass numbers or atomic masses. The criterion, however, failed to categorize elements with similar chemical properties together because mass number does not determine the chemical properties of an element. Using his arrangement, Mendeleev left gaps in his Periodic table as he predicted new elements would be discovered which would fill those gaps. He even used the patterns of his table to make predictions of the properties of the undiscovered elements, with quite remarkable accuracy. As predicted, the original Periodic table was modified and corrected several times to accommodate new elements that were discovered later. Video7.Mendeleev_the_periodic_table.mp4. It was in 1913, when an English scientist called Moseley attempted to modify the periodic table of Mendeleev. Using X-ray spectroscopy, Moseley discovered that elements' properties were better organized by atomic number rather than atomic weight. He therefore used atomic number to classify all the elements and all the elements with similar chemical properties found themselves together, and this periodic table was referred to as the modern periodic table. The modern periodic table has a law called the periodic table law. It states that the chemical property of an element is the function of its atomic number. This means that the chemical property of an element is determined by the atomic number which is equal to the number of electrons, that, element contains (We shall discover this in detail in this very chapter). Modern technology, such as particle accelerators, has enabled scientists to synthesize superheavy elements that exist only briefly before decaying. By 1869, only 63 elements had been discovered, and by 2019, they were 118 elements. Note: The periodic table provides a great deal of information about elements; It’s used to predict both the chemical and physical properties of elements that make up the universe; Knowledge of the physical properties of elements enables one make the right choices for the materials to use for different purposes, explain the occurrence of particular processes and tell the durability of substances or materials. The modern periodic table. The modern periodic table is divided into groups and periods of the elements. An element is a pure substance that cannot be split or divided into two or more simpler forms by any known chemical means. There are about 118 different types of elements. Most of the elements exist in the earth crust. However, some of these elements are more abundant than others. The elements which have similar chemical properties are in the same columns called groups. The group number is written in Roman numerals. The horizontal rows of the elements are called periods. The period number is written in Arabic numerals. There are 8 groups in the periodic table, numbered I–VIII. Group VIII is also known as group O. The group number is equal to the number of electrons in the outer most energy level of the element. Elements of the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of outer most energy level electrons (valency electrons). Atomic size (radius) increases down the group as more energy levels are added. Figure145.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_001.jpg. Each element is represented by a unique chemical symbol. Elements in the same group have a common valency. The group number is equal to the number of electrons in the outer most energy level of the element. There are 7 periods in the periodic table. Elements in the same period have the same number of energy levels. Period 1 contains 2 elements, hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and 3 are short periods and contain 8 elements. Periods 4 and 5 are long periods and contain 18 elements each. Characteristics of a period. Elements in the same period have the same number of energy levels, occupied by electrons and give the period number. The atomic radius (size) decreases across a period, from left to right. Elements in the same period have different chemical properties. Elements in the same period have different valencies. Each period ends with a noble gas. Position of hydrogen. Hydrogen is placed in both group I and VII of the periodic table. This shows a unique property of hydrogen. It is considered a group I element because it has a valency of 1 and can form an ion with positive charge of 1. It is placed it group VII because it reacts like group VII elements e.g., sodium hydride is an ionic compound. Figure146.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_012.jpg. Figure146.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_002.jpg. Sometimes, elements in the different groups are known by different names e.g. Group I (Alkali metals), Group II (Alkaline earth metals), Group VII (Halogens), Group VIII (Noble gases/Rare gases/Inert gases). The elements in the periodic table are classified as Metals, Metalloids, Non-metals and Noble gases/Rare gases/Inert gases. i) Metals are on the left of the periodic table in group I, II and III. Metals react by loss of electrons. ii) Semi metals (metalloids). There are 7 metalloids in the periodic table [Boron in group III, (Silicon and Germanium) in group IV, (Arsenic and Antimony) in group V and the other 2 are in group VI]. Some of the metalloids such as silicon and germanium are semi-conductors, meaning they can carry an electrical charge under specific conditions. This property makes metalloids economically useful and valuable in the semi-conductor and computer chip industry. iii) Non-metals are on the right of the periodic table in groups V, VI and VII. Non-metals react by gain of electrons. iv) Noble/rare/inert gases: They are at the extreme right of the periodic table in group VIII (O). Noble gases are not reactive because they are very stable. Transition elements are found between group II and III and towards the bottom of the periodic table. Transition elements form coloured compounds and have variable valencies. Examples of transition elements include copper, iron, chromium, cobalt etc. [Assignment 2] {Group a minimum of 20 elements into metals and non-metals and relate the physical properties of metals and non-metals to their uses}. A metal is an element which forms positive ions by losing electrons except hydrogen. The metallic character of elements generally increases from the top to bottom, down a group and generally decreases from the left to the right of a period. Characteristics of metals. Metals are generally hard except Sodium and Potassium. They generally have high melting and boiling points. Metals conduct electricity and heat e.g., iron, copper, aluminum etc. Some metals are magnetic e.g., iron. Metals are malleable and ductile i.e.,; they can be bent without necessarily breaking. Metals exist as solids except mercury which exists as a liquid at room temperature. Gallium is a liquid at just above room temperature. Characteristics of non-metals. A non-metal is an element which forms negative ions by gaining electrons. Non-metals have low melting and boiling points except diamond and graphite. They are brittle, hard but can easily be broken if force is applied on them. They exist as soft solids except diamond, liquids and gases at room temperature except bromine. They are insulators (they do not conduct electricity and heat) except graphite. They are non-magnetic. Physical properties of metals and non-metals. Metals: Lustrous, can be polished i.e., shinning and thus can be used to make jewelry; Strong and tough, high tensile strength and thus can be used to build scaffolding and bridges; Malleable, Able to be hammered or pressed into shape without breaking/cracking and thus can be used in making electrical cables; Ductile, Able to be deformed without losing toughness, thus not brittle; Metals generally, have high densities; Good conductors of heat and electricity and thus can be used to make pans for cooking and electric cables; Sonorous i.e., produce a deep/ringing sound when hit and thus can be used in making bells. Non-metals: Not lustrous except Iodine; Low tensile strength; Not malleable; Not ductile; Non-metals generally, have low densities; Poor conductors of heat and thus can be used to make pan handles; Do not conduct electricity and thus can be used as insulating material around wire cables; Not sonorous. Trend of reactivity of elements in the periodic table. 1) Elements in the same group react in similar ways because they have the same number of electrons in their outer most energy level or shell. 2) Down the group of metals, reactivity increases. This is because of increase in atomic size (atomic radius). As the size of atoms increase, the outer most electrons become loosely held because they are no longer strongly attracted by the nucleus, hence, such electrons are easily lost. Because metals react by loss of electrons, the more easily a metal loses electrons, the more reactive that metal is. 3) Down the group of non-metals, reactivity decreases. This is due to an increase in atomic size (atomic radius). As the atomic sizes increase, the forces of attraction of the nucleus for the electrons decreases, hence electrons cannot be gained readily. The more easily a non-metal gains electrons, the more reactive that non-metal is. 4) Across the period of elements from the left to the right, reactivity decreases from group I to group IV and then increases up to group VII and falls sharply in group VIII. This is because, as you go across the period, the effective force of the nucleus increases, hence the outer most electrons become more strongly attracted. Please note that we shall cover properties of elements and trends in the periodic table in detail later on. The structure of the atom. Figure146.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_102.jpg. The development of atomic structure understanding has evolved significantly over history: Ancient Greek philosophers like Democritus proposed the concept of atoms as indivisible particles. John Dalton's early 19th-century atomic theory suggested atoms combine in whole-number ratios. J.J.Thomson's late 19th-century experiments led to the discovery of electrons. Ernest Rutherford's early 20th-century gold foil experiment revealed the nucleus, leading to his nuclear model of the atom. Niels Bohr expanded upon Rutherford's model with quantised energy levels for electrons. The mid-20th century saw the development of quantum mechanics, refining atomic theory with principles like wave-particle duality. Today's atomic model is based on quantum mechanics, describing atoms as nuclei surrounded by electron clouds in specific energy levels. Throughout this progression, scientific advancements and theoretical insights continually refined our understanding of atomic structure. Atomic structure deals with the study of the composition of an atom. Atoms are the building blocks from which all matter is made. An atom is the smallest particle of an element that takes part in a chemical reaction. All atoms of the same element are identical and different from those of other elements. An atom is spherical in shape and has a small region in the centre called the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by circular paths known as electron shells or energy levels that carry electrons. These shells are represented as circles. Therefore, each atom is made up of these two regions (The nucleus and the Energy levels). The nucleus. An atom consists of electrons moving around a small nucleus. The nucleus occupies the central part of the atom. This part is smaller compared to the orbit. The nucleus is extremely dense (heavy) because of the presence of protons and neutrons. Note: The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a single proton and for this reason, it is considered the lightest atom. The nuclei of other atoms consist of both protons and neutrons. The number of protons varies from 1 to 92. The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called the atomic number. The Orbit/shell/Energy level. The orbit is the space outside the nucleus of an atom where electrons revolve or are found. The greater the number of electrons in an atom, the greater the number of orbits. Studies have shown that electrons rotate around the orbits i.e., they are not stationary within the orbit. Electrons occupy the orbits according to their energy levels. The orbits nearer to the nucleus have the lowest energy while those orbits far from the nucleus have the highest energy. The energy level (shell) closest to the nucleus is called the 1ˢᵗ energy level or the K shell. The 2ⁿᵈ closest shell to the nucleus is the 2ⁿᵈ energy level or the L shell. This is followed by the 3ʳᵈ shell or the M shell. So, the energy levels are named 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ, 4ᵗʰ, etc., or K, L, M, N etc., from the shell closest to the nucleus outwardly. The outermost electron shell is also called the valence electron shell. The electrons are held within an atom by an electrostatic force of attraction between themselves and the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus. An electron can only remain rotating within the same orbit when the centripetal force and centrifugal forces are balanced. The chemical property of an element/atom is determined only by the electrons and not the protons and neutrons. Composition of an atom. Figure147.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_003.jpg. The atom is made up of three fundamental sub-atomic particles called protons, neutrons and electrons. These particles differ from each other in terms of mass and charge. Protons (p): They are present in the nucleus of an atom. A proton has one positive charge (+1), the smallest unit positive charge that can exist. Neutrons (n): They are present in the nucleus of all atoms except hydrogen. They have no charge (Are neutral). They have a relative mass of 1, i.e., the mass is approximately the same as that of a proton. The particles (protons and neutrons) occupy the nucleus of an atom and are collectively called Nucleons. Electrons (e): Electrons occur in the energy levels or electron shells and are constantly rotating around the nucleus. Electrons move in orbits around the nucleus, like planets move around the sun. An electron has one negative charge, the smallest unit negative charge that can exist. The masses of particles in atoms are measured by a unit called atomic mass unit (amu). 1 amu is equivalent to the mass of hydrogen which is the smallest atom. Both protons and neutrons have a mass of 1 amu. An electron has a very small mass, (1/1840) amu. (1/1840) amu means that the electron is (1/1840) times lighter than the proton or neutron. Therefore, its mass is said to be negligible. Meaning, it is the protons and neutrons that account for most of the mass of the atom, their number determines the overall mass of the atom. Note: An atom is neutral, therefore, the number of electrons (-ve) must equal the number of protons (+ve) in the nucleus. Figure148.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_004.jpg. Figure149.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_005.jpg. Atomic characteristics: An atom of any element differs from those of the other elements due to the difference brought about by atomic number and atomic mass of different elements. 1) Atomic Number (Z). Atomic number is the total number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of an element. It is donated by letter Z. The atomic number of each element is unique and it is used to identify the element. All atoms of the same element have the same atomic number. 2) Nucleon Number/Mass Number/Atomic Mass (A). Mass number is the sum of all protons and all neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. It is denoted by letter A. Mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons. The mass number and atomic number of an element can be written together with the symbol to completely describe the atom of an element. The mass number is written on the top left-hand corner and atomic number is written on the bottom left-hand corner of the symbol. An atom can be represented as: Figure153.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_009.jpg. Where X is the symbol of an element; A is the atomic mass or mass number or nucleon number and Z is the atomic number or proton number. Figure154.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_010.jpg. 37 represents mass number. 17 represents atomic number. 37-17 = 20 = number of neutrons. Figure155.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_011.jpg. Examples: (a) An atom of element of X has atomic number, 20 and mass number, 40. (i) Write the electronic configuration of the element. (2:8:8:2). (ii) State the group and period of the element. Group II because it has two electrons in the outermost shell. Period four because it has four shells/orbits occupied by electrons. (iii) Write the formula of the chloride, oxide and nitrate of X. Chloride, XCl₂. Nitrate, X(NO₃)₂. Oxide, XO. (b) Element Y has atomic number, 11. (i) Write the electronic configuration of Y. (2:8:1). (ii) State the period and group of Y. Give reasons for your answers. Period three because it has three shells having electrons. Group I because it has one electron in the last orbit/shell. (iii) Write the formula of sulphate of Y. Y₂SO₄. Isotopes. Isotopes are different atoms of the same element having the same number of protons but different number of neutrons, therefore different mass numbers. For elements that show isotopy, the most abundant (common) isotope is taken to be the representative of all the elements. The abundance is usually given as a percentage. Examples. Figure150.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_006.jpg. Figure151.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_007.jpg. Characteristics of isotopes. a) They have the same number of protons. b) They have different number of neutrons. c) They have the same number of electrons. d) They share the same chemical properties but may differ in their physical properties. Individually, research about other elements that have isotopes including potassium and oxygen. ISOTOPY. Isotopy is the existence of atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different mass numbers due to the difference in the number of neutrons. Video8.Structure_of_an_Atom.mp4. Relative atomic mass. Relative atomic mass (R.A.M) is the mass of one atom of an element compared to 1/12ᵗʰ (a twelfth) of the mass of the carbon-12 isotope. It is the mass of one atom of the element divided by 1/12ᵗʰ of the mass of carbon-12 isotope. Figure152.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_008.jpg. Relative atomic mass is a ratio of the same quantity and therefore, it does not have units. Using the formula above, hydrogen was given a mass of 1.0008 ≈ 1, Oxygen [16], Nitrogen [14], etc. The relative atomic mass is not always a whole number due to the presence of isotopes. In such a case, the value is obtained by taking the average of the relative masses of isotopes of an element based on their natural abundance. Calculation of Relative atomic mass from relative abundance of isotopes of an element. Examples. 1) Natural chlorine consists of 75% Chlorine–35 and 25% Chlorine-37. Calculate the relative atomic mass of chlorine. Chlorine–35 = (75x35)/100 = 26.25. Chlorine–37 = (25x37)/100 = 9.25. Relative atomic mass of chlorine = (26.25 + 9.25) = 35.5. 2) A sample of chlorine is a mixture of two isotopes, chlorine–35 and chlorine-37 in the ratio (3:1). Calculate the Relative atomic mass of chlorine atom. Total ratio (3 + 1) = 4. Chlorine–35 = (3x35)/4 = 26.25. Chlorine–37 = (1x37)/4 = 9.25. Relative atomic mass of chlorine = (26.25 + 9.25) = 35.5. 3) Naturally occurring Gallium consists of isotopes, Gallium–69 and Gallium–71 in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the relative atomic mass of gallium. 4) The percentage abundances of the isotopes of lead are as follows: Lead-207 = 25%, Lead-206 = 25% and Lead-205 = 50%. Calculate the relative atomic mass of lead. 5) Neon has three isotopes, Ne-20 (percentage abundance 90.5%), Ne-21 (percentage abundance of 0.3%) and Ne-22 (percentage abundance of 9.2%). Calculate the relative atomic mass of Neon. • In groups, use prior learning and research to discuss how: a) • You might identify a metal and a non-metal and present to other groups. b) • To arrange elements into a table according to whether they are metals or non-metals e.g., iron, sulphur, copper, hydrogen, silver, aluminium, oxygen, chlorine, argon, sodium, magnesium, calcium, iodine, nitrogen, zinc and present conclusions to other groups. [Assignment 3] {Relate the arrangement of electrons in the first 20 elements to their positions in the Periodic table}. Electronic structures of elements. The way electrons are arranged in an atom is referred to as electronic structure. The electrons move in definite orbits around the nucleus. The orbits which electrons occupy have definite energies. All electrons in a given shell have approximately equal energy. This energy increases in successive shells outwards from the nucleus. Electrons exist singly or in pairs in the energy levels. The orbit nearer the nucleus has less energy than subsequent orbits. The further away the orbit is from the nucleus, the greater the energy. Therefore, when electrons gain energy, they move to higher orbits. When they lose energy, they move to lower orbits. Figure156.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_012.jpg. Figure157.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_013.jpg. Figure158.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_014.jpg. Number of electrons in a shell. The number of electrons that can fill an energy level or shell numbered n is 2n², where n is the number of orbits. [n = 1, 2, 3, …]. If n = 1, number of electrons = 2. If n = 2, number of electrons = 8. If n = 3, number of electrons = 18. If n = 4, number of electrons = 32. However, a given energy shell can have less than the maximum number of electrons but not more. 1) The first shell (orbit) has the lowest energy and electrons fill it first. It holds a maximum of two electrons. 2) The second and third orbits, which are farther away from the nucleus, can each have a maximum of 8 electrons. 3) In the outer most shell of any atom, the maximum number of electrons possible is 8. Electronic configuration. The electronic configuration of an atom is an arrangement of electrons according to the sequence of energy levels. The electronic configuration is written by showing the number of electrons in each energy level, starting with electrons in the first energy level. Note: The arrangement of electrons in an atom is the electronic configuration and a structure drawn showing the distribution of electrons in the energy levels is the electronic structure. Figure159.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_015.jpg. Valency. Valency of an element can be derived from the electronic structure of its atom. Valency is the combining power of an element or radical. The power of an element to combine with others is determined by the structure of its atoms. This therefore implies that the valency of an element can be determined from the electron structure of its atoms. Elements with atoms having 1-4 electrons in the outer most shell, have valencies equivalent to the number of electrons in the outer most shell. i.e., Group I elements have a valency of 1; group II elements have a valency of 2; group III elements have a valency of 3 and group IV elements have a valency of 4. Figure160.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_016.jpg. Elements with atoms having 5–7 electrons in the outer most shell (group V-VII) have valencies equal to the number of electrons gained to acquire a stable electronic configuration (8 – electrons in the outer shell). Elements in group V gain three electrons each to make them stable, they therefore have a valency of 3; Elements in group VI gain two electrons each to make them stable, they therefore have a valency of 2 and elements in group VII gain one electron each to make them stable, they therefore have a valency of 1. Phosphorus 	(2:8:5) 		[3]. Sulphur 	(2:8:6) 		[2]. Chlorine 	(2:8:7) 		[1]. Note: Noble gases are said to be unreactive elements because they have a stable electronic configuration in which their outermost orbit has eight electrons giving them a valency of zero. Note: Therefore, valency can also be defined as the number of electrons lost or gained by an element in order to attain a stable electronic structure. Note: For metals with variable valencies, Roman numerals are included in their name to indicate the valencies of the metal. E.g., Iron (II) has a valency of 2, Lead (IV) has a valency of 4 etc. The information obtained from the electronic configuration of an atom can be used: a) To tell whether the element is a metal or non-metal or metalloid or rare gas. For metals, their outermost shell has generally less than four electrons. For non-metals, their outermost shell contains generally more than four electrons. Metalloids are elements which behave neither like a non-metal nor a metal. Their valences can vary depending on their chemical environment. This means that the valence of a metalloid in a compound can be influenced by factors such as the identity and arrangement of other atoms with which it interacts. These elements are found along the diagonal line in the Periodic table. b) To determine the valency/valence of the element. The outermost shell electrons of an element are called valency electrons because they determine the valency of the element. If an element has less than four electrons in the outermost shell, then those become the valency of that element. If an element has four or less electrons in its valency shell, then the valency of that element will be eight minus the number of electrons in the outermost shell. • Individually carry out research to find the chemical symbol and physical properties of each element and record your results in a chart. • In pairs, study the Periodic table and carry out research and complete reports, explaining: a) • The work of Mendeleev and others in classifying the elements. b) • The meanings of the terms, proton/atomic number and mass number. c) • The relationship between the proton (atomic) number of an element and the number of electrons. • In groups, discuss your findings and use a card activity and research to give each of the 13 most abundant elements in Earth’s crust, listed from the most to least abundant, its symbol, proton number, atomic mass, electron configuration, and element classification (• oxygen • silicon • aluminium • iron • calcium • sodium • magnesium • potassium • titanium • hydrogen • phosphorus • sulphur • carbon). • You can use any word processor to write the research report. [Assignment 4] {Explore the relationship between the position of elements in groups and the charge on the ions that they form}. Ion formation. If an atom does not have 2 or 8 valence electrons, it is not stable! Not stable means the atom will react by gaining or losing electrons, just to make sure that it has either a ‘2’ or ‘8’ as the number of valence electrons. When elements gain or lose electrons to become stable, they form “ions”. An ion is an electrically charged particle formed from an atom or a group of chemically combined atoms by gaining or losing one or more electrons. Ions are either negatively charged (anions) or positively charged (cations). Positive ion formation. Positive ions are formed when atoms or group of chemically combined atoms lose electrons. Atoms lose electrons so as to acquire a stable electronic configuration as the noble gases. The positive ions (cations) are formed by metal atoms, hydrogen atoms and ammonium. Metal atoms having 1-3 electrons in the outer most shells lose these electrons to form positive ions. Cations have more protons than electrons. Formation of sodium ion (Na⁺). Sodium atom with 11 electrons (electronic configuration, 2:8:1), has 1 electron more than the stable configuration of a noble gas, (2:8). During reaction, sodium loses the 1 electron in the outer most energy level (electron shell) to become stable and forms sodium ion (electronic configuration, 2:8) [Na(s) → Na⁺ + e ⁻]. Figure161.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_017.jpg. Formation of lithium ion (Li⁺). Lithium atom with 3 electrons (electronic configuration, 2:1), has 1 electron more than the stable configuration of a noble gas, (2). During reaction, lithium loses the 1 electron in the outer most energy level (electron shell) to become stable and forms lithium ion (electronic configuration, 2) [Li(s) → Li⁺ + e ⁻]. Figure162.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_018.jpg. Formation of Magnesium ion (Mg²⁺). Magnesium atom with 12 electrons (electronic configuration, 2:8:2), has 2 electrons more than the stable configuration of a noble gas, (2:8). During reaction, Magnesium loses the 2 electrons in the outer most energy level (electron shell) to become stable and forms Magnesium ion (electronic configuration, 2:8) [Mg(s) → Mg²⁺ + 2e ⁻]. Formation of Aluminium ion (Al³⁺). Aluminium atom with 13 electrons (electronic configuration, 2:8:3), has 3 electrons more than the stable configuration of a noble gas, (2:8). During reaction, Aluminium loses the 3 electrons in the outer most energy level (electron shell) to become stable and forms aluminium ion (electronic configuration, 2:8) [Al(s) → Al³⁺ + 3e ⁻]. Figure163.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_019.jpg. Negative ion formation. Negative ions are formed when atoms gain electrons. Atoms gain electrons so as to acquire a stable electronic configuration as the noble gases. The negative ions (anions) are formed by non-metal atoms. Non-metals having 5-7 electrons in their outer most shell gain electrons to form negative ions. Anions have more electrons than protons. Examples of anions are a chloride ion and an oxide ion. Formation of a chloride ion (Cl⁻). The ion is formed from a chlorine atom. Chlorine atom (electronic configuration, 2:8:7) lacks only one electron to attain the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas (2:8:8). The chlorine atom therefore gains the one electron during reaction and forms a chloride ion [Cl + e ⁻ → Cl⁻]. Figure164.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_020.jpg. Formation of an oxide ion (O²⁻). The oxide ion is formed from an oxygen atom. Oxygen atom (electronic configuration, 2:6) lacks two electrons to attain the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas (2:8). The oxygen atom therefore gains the two electrons during reaction and forms an oxide ion [O + 2e ⁻ → O²⁻]. Figure165.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_021.jpg. Formation of a sulphide ion (S²⁻). The sulphide ion is formed from a sulphur atom. Sulphur atom (electronic configuration, 2:8:6) lacks two electrons to attain the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas (2:8:8). The sulphur atom therefore gains the two electrons during reaction and forms a sulphide ion [S + 2e ⁻ → S²⁻]. Figure166.2.3.the_periodic_table_image_022.jpg. Note: A radical is an atom or group of atoms that exists in several compounds but does not exist on its own.
