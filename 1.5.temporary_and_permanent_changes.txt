Theme ***Temporary and permanent changes to materials*** "@OMD". TOPIC 2.2 ***TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT CHANGES*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner recognises occurrence of temporary and permanent changes, and their importance in everyday life. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand that many substances undergo permanent changes when they are heated or burnt, forming new materials, while other substances change temporarily (u, s); b) Recognise temporary (reversible) and permanent (irreversible) changes to matter under different conditions (u). Matter undergoes several changes classified as physical/non-permanent/temporary/reversible or chemical/permanent/irreversible changes. 1) Physical or temporary changes. Physical changes occur when no new chemical substances are formed. The products have the same chemical properties as the reactants. Examples of physical changes include: (a) Melting of candle wax. (b) Melting of ice. (c) Sublimation of iodine crystals. When iodine crystals are heated, they change into vapour which condenses to form iodine crystals. (d) Sublimation of ammonium chloride. 2) Chemical or permanent changes. Chemical changes occur when new chemical substances are formed. The products have chemical properties different from those of the reactants. Examples of chemical changes include: (a) Burning of wood, papers or grass. (b) Heating of copper (II) sulphate crystals. (c) Heating of potassium permanganate crystals. Figure7.1.5.temporary_and_permanent_changes.023.jpg. Note: Changes in colour of substances could be as a result of either a physical or chemical change. Table1.Colours_of_substances.odt. Suggested Learning Activities. • In groups, draw on prior learning from Topic 2 and identify which materials underwent permanent changes when heated. • In groups, plan and carry out a practical investigation to find out temporary and permanent changes, and record the results in a table about: • boiling and condensing water • heating and cooling candle wax • sublimation of iodine • breaking a wooden stick • melting of ice • boiling an egg • dissolving salt in water • rusting an iron nail;
