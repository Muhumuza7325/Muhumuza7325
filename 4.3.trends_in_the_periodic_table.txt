To start, we shall really need notes of chapter 6 (The Periodic table). In this very chapter, we shall be building on what we learnt from chapter 6. To accomplish some of the suggested learning activities with in this chapter, you will need prior knowledge from chapter 6 and the chapters of water, air and the reactivity series. Chemical families. This refers to elements with the same chemical properties i.e., elements in the same group of the periodic table with the same number of electrons in the outer most shell. The common chemical families are; alkali/alkaline metals; alkaline earth metals; halogens and noble gases. The alkali metals (Group I). Atoms of group I elements have one electron in the outer most shell which is easily lost during chemical reactions leaving a single positively charged ion. They are therefore monovalent. These metals are very reactive and are kept under oil in the laboratory where they have no contact with water and air. They are called alkali metals because they react with water to form alkaline solutions. Li (2:1), Na (2:8:1), K (2:8:8:1). Physical properties of Alkali metals. Have low melting and boiling points because each metal contributes only one electron to the sea of electrons hence weak metallic bonding. The melting point decreases down the group. They are soft and show shiny surfaces when freshly cut. The softness decreases down the group and the shiny surfaces soon tarnish due to reaction with oxygen to form the oxides. Conduct electricity and heat due to mobile electrons. Have low densities. Their density is less than that of water so they float on water. They do not possess tensile strength to any appreciable extent. Group I elements are the most reactive metals. They are the most electropositive elements. Electropositivity refers to the ability of an element to lose electrons. Reactions of alkali metals with air, water and chlorine. Reactivity of the alkaline metals increases down the group due to increase in atomic size (i.e., potassium is the most reactive followed by sodium and lithium is the least reactive). 1) Reaction with air When the metals are heated in oxygen, they burn readily forming oxides of the metal. Potassium burns with a bright purple flame producing white solids of potassium oxide. 4K(s) + O₂(g) → 2K₂O(s). Sodium burns in air with a bright yellow flame forming yellow solids of sodium peroxide in plenty of air. In limited in air, sodium burns with a yellow flame to form a white solid, sodium oxide. 4Na(s) + 2O₂(g) → 2Na₂O₂(s) (In excess air). 4Na(s) + O₂(g) → 2Na₂O(s) (In limited air). Lithium burns in oxygen with a crimson flame (intensive white) to form a white solid, lithium oxide. 4Li(s) + O₂(g) → 2Li₂O(s). 2) Reaction with water. All the metals react with cold water to produce hydrogen gas and alkaline solution of metal hydroxides. Potassium reacts very vigorously, darts on water and burns with a bright purple (lilac) flame producing fumes of hydrogen gas and an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide. 2K(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H₂(g). Sodium melts into a silvery ball, darts on water, reacting vigorously with water, producing fumes of hydrogen gas with a hissing sound and an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide. The sodium reduces in size as the reaction proceeds until when it finally disappears. 2Na(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g). Lithium floats on water surface, gradually dissolving producing hydrogen gas. An alkaline solution is formed. 2Li(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2LiOH(aq) + H₂(g). 3) Reaction with chlorine The alkaline metals react with chlorine to form metal chloride salts. E.g., Potassium burns in chlorine to form fumes of potassium chloride. K(s) + Cl₂(g) → KCl(s). Sodium continuous to burn in chlorine with a bright yellow flame to form white fumes of sodium chloride. Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → NaCl(s). Lithium reacts with chlorine to form lithium chloride. 2Li(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2LiCl(s). 4) Reaction with acids. Alkaline metals react explosively with acids to liberate hydrogen gas and forming a corresponding salt. E.g., sodium reacts with hydrochloric acid to form sodium chloride and hydrogen gas. 2Na(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H₂(g). Potassium reacts with sulphuric acid to form potassium sulphate and hydrogen gas. 2K(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → K₂SO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Uses of sodium. Manufacture of sodium hydroxide used in paper industry. In glass industry as sodium carbonate. Sodium vapour lamps are used for street lighting. Produce sodium chloride, a food additive. Molten sodium is used as a coolant in some nuclear reactors. The alkaline earth metals (Group II elements). All group II elements have 2 electrons in the outermost shell. They are divalent. Be (2:2), Mg (2:8:2), Ca (2:8:8:2). They are called alkaline earth metals because they are the only metals found beneath the earth which are alkaline. Other metals found beneath the earth include gold, copper etc. As the group is descended, the size of the atom increases as more energy levels are added. Physical properties of group II metals. Higher melting and boiling points than those of group II metals. This is because these metals release more electrons into the electron cloud forming a stronger metallic bond in the metal structure. This explains why they are also harder than group I metals. High densities because of small size of atoms that allows close packing Good conductors of heat and electricity since they have mobile electrons. They are harder than the alkali metals. They are silver-grey in colour when pure and clean. Chemical reactions of alkaline earth metals. Alkaline earth metals are less reactive than alkaline metals. This is because the valence electrons in alkaline earth metals are held more strongly due to increased effective nuclear charge making them not easily to be released. Reactivity of the metals increases down the group due to increase in atomic size. (calcium is the most reactive followed by magnesium then beryllium). 1) Reaction with air. The metals burn in air with their characteristic flames forming oxides of the metal. Magnesium burns in air with a brilliant white flame forming white ash of magnesium oxide. 2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s). Calcium burns in air with a bright orange/red flame forming white ash of calcium oxide. Ca(s) + O₂(g) → 2CaO(s). Both metals also form some nitrides especially if the supply of oxygen is limited. In limited oxygen, magnesium reacts with nitrogen of air to form a white powder of magnesium nitride. 3Mg(s) + N₂(g) → Mg₃N₂(s) (Magnesium nitride). 3Ca(s) + N₂(g) → Ca₃N₂(s) (Calcium nitride). When the nitrides are dissolved in water and the solution warmed, ammonia gas is liberated and an alkaline solution is also formed. Mg₃N₂(s) + 6H₂O(l) → 3Mg(OH)₂(aq) + 2NH₃(g). Ca₃N₂(s) + 6H₂O(l) → 3Ca(OH)₂(aq) + 2NH₃(g). 2) Reaction with water. Beryllium does not react with water. Magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water producing small bubbles of hydrogen gas and an alkaline solution of magnesium hydroxide. Mg(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g). Magnesium reacts very rapidly with steam to produce white ash of magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas. 2Mg(s) + 2H₂O(g) → 2MgO(s) + 2H₂(g). Calcium sinks to the bottom as it’s denser than water. Effervescence occurs and hydrogen gas is given off. A cloudy solution of calcium hydroxide is formed. Ca(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g). 3) Reaction with chlorine. The metals burn readily in chlorine to form white anhydrous chloride salts. Magnesium burns brightly in chlorine to form a white solid of magnesium chloride. Mg(s) + Cl₂(g) → MgCl₂(s). Calcium reacts with chlorine to form calcium chloride. Ca(s) + Cl₂(g) → CaCl₂(s). 4) Reaction with acids. Calcium reacts vigorously with acids forming a salt and hydrogen gas. Magnesium reacts steadily with acids forming a salt and hydrogen gas. E.g., magnesium reacts with dilute sulphuric acid forming magnesium sulphate and hydrogen gas. Mg(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → MgSO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Magnesium reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid giving off hydrogen gas. Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl₂(s) + H₂(g). Uses of alkaline earth metals. Beryllium is used in making parts of high-speed air craft and in missiles. It’s used in nuclear reactors and communication satellites. Calcium hydroxide is used as lime in building industry and road construction. Calcium is used in biological process for the formation of strong bones and teeth. Magnesium is used in photographic flash lights and fireworks. It’s also used in making magnesium hydroxide which is anti-acid medicine. Halogens (Group VII). The word halogen means ‘salt producer’, since all halogen elements react with most metals to form electrovalent, salt-like compounds. All members of this group have 7 electrons in their outermost shells. They have one electron short of the noble gas structure. They are the most electronegative elements. Electronegativity refers to the ability of an element to gain electrons. Physical properties of Halogens. Halogens exist as diatomic molecules in gas, liquid or solid state i.e., F₂, Cl₂, Br₂ and I₂. This is because they lack one electron to completely fill their outer most energy level, thus, their atoms share electrons in order to completely fill the outer most energy level. They are coloured (Refer to the colour chart). Down the group, physical state changes from gas to liquid to solid. (Fluorine and chlorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a liquid and, iodine is in solid form, the shiny black iodine solids sublime into a purple vapour on slight heating). The size of the molecules increases down the group due to the increasing size of the halogen atom. They have low melting and boiling points because of the weaker intermolecular forces of attraction. Their melting points and boiling points increase down the group due to strong forces of attraction down the group (the weak Vander Waal’s forces of attraction increase with increase in atomic size). They are poor conductors of electricity and heat. Solubility in water decreases down the group. Fluorine, chlorine and bromine are soluble and iodine is slightly soluble in water. Halogens are the most reactive non metals. Their atomic radii increase down the group due to the effect of increasing number of energy levels increasing nuclear charge. Chemical reactions of Halogens. The order of reactivity decreases down the group. The order of reactivity of halogens is Fluorine > Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine > Astatine [This follows their order in the periodic table]. This is because these elements react by gaining electrons and down the group, the atomic radius increases therefore, an incoming electron is less readily attracted by the nucleus. Therefore, the smaller the atom, the more readily and strongly does the nucleus attract an electron to the outer most shell and the more reactive that atom becomes. (a) Reaction with metals. Most heated metals continue to burn in halogens to form salts (metal halides). Metal(s) + halogen(g) → metal halide(s). Sodium continues to burn in a gas jar of chlorine to form dense white fumes which settle as white solids of sodium chloride. A similar reaction occurs with bromine and iodine are used. 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s). Zn(s) + Cl₂(g) → ZnCl₂(s). 2Fe(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → 2FeCl₃(s). (b) Reaction with water. All the halogens dissolve in water forming a mixture of acids. Chlorine dissolves in water to form a mixture of hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid. Cl₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HCl(aq) + HOCl(aq). This solution turns blue litmus paper red then bleaches it. The bleaching action is due to the presence of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that readily gives up its oxygen to the dye. Note: The bleaching power of halogens decreases down the group. A solution of bromine in water is weakly acidic and weakly bleaching due to formation of weak hydrobromic acid (HBr) and bromic(I)acid (HOBr) respectively. Br₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HOBr(aq) + HBr(aq). (c) Reaction with alkalis. Halogens react with alkalis to form a mixture of salts and water. Cold dilute sodium hydroxide reacts with chlorine to form a pale-yellow solution [A mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)]. Cl₂(g) + 2NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + NaOCl(aq) + H₂O(l). In a hot concentrated solution of an alkali (e.g. NaOH), sodium hypochlorite is not formed, but instead, sodium hypochlorate is formed (NaOCl₃). 3Cl₂(g) + 6NaOH(aq) → 5NaCl(aq) + NaOCl₃(aq) + 3H₂O(l). (d) Displacement reaction of halogens. When chlorine is bubbled through a colourless solution of potassium bromide, the solution gradually changes to red-brown as bromine is displaced from its solution by chlorine. 2KBr(aq) + Cl₂(g) → 2KCl(aq) + Br₂(g). If chlorine is bubbled through a colourless solution of potassium iodide, the solution turns dark brown as iodine is displaced from its solution. 2KI(aq) + Cl₂(g) → 2KCl(aq) + I₂(g). Chlorine being the most reactive, it displaces all the halogens from their solutions. Uses of halogens. Chlorine. As a domestic bleach and as a disinfectant in swimming pools. Manufacture of hydrochloric acid. In paper and textile industry. Manufacture of weed killer iodine. Iodine. Tincture of iodine used for medical purposes. Making of antibacterial agents. Bromine. In photographic industry as silver bromide. Used as petrol additives used in anti-knock petrol. Noble gases [Group VIII (O) elements]. They are called noble gases because they do not combine with themselves or with other elements. They are the least reactive non-metals and are sometimes referred to as the inert elements. This is because of completely filled outermost energy levels which make them stable. Helium (He) [2] [2]. Neon (Ne) [10] [2:8]. Argon (Ar) [18] [2:8:8]. Characteristics of noble gases. 1) Their outer most energy levels are completely filled with electrons making them very stable elements and chemically non-reactive. However, in spite of their stable electronic configurations, a few compounds have been formed from xenon (e.g., Xenon (II) fluoride, XeF₂) and krypton (E.g., krypton (II) fluoride, KrF₂). 2) The noble gases exist as monatomic gases. 3) They have very low melting and boiling points due to the negligible forces of attraction between the atoms. 4) Noble gases are colourless. Uses of noble gases. Helium is a very light gas and is used in inflating airships, weather balloons and aeroplane tyres. Neon is used extensively in neon lights for advertisement and in lasers. Argon is used in electric light bulbs. It stops oxidation of the hot tungsten filament that can darken the glass bulbs. Argon provides an inert environment for gas-liquid chromatography, for risky welding jobs and for some chemical reactions. Instead of air, a mixture of oxygen and helium is used by divers. Transition metals. These are metals found between group II and group III e.g., Zinc, copper iron chromium, nickel. Characteristics of transition metals. They have high densities, high melting and boiling points. Their valencies are variable i.e., they have more than one valency. They form coloured compounds. They behave as catalysts (most catalysts are transition metals/compounds). Exercise. Qn) Part of the periodic table is shown below. Figure326.4.3.trends_in_the_periodic_table_image_001.jpg.
