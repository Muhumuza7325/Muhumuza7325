Theme ***Modern Physics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 5 ***ATOMIC MODELS*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to appreciate the different atomic models and how they are used to explain the basic structure of atoms. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the structure of an atom in terms of a positive nucleus and negative electrons (u); b) understand the terms: atomic number, mass number, and isotopes, and use them to represent different nuclides (k, u); c) understand the methods by which electrons are ejected from /matter atoms and how these electrons are useful (u, v/a). • In pairs, revisit prior learning about atoms, (atomic number, mass number, nuclides, isotopes) and research on the representation of different atoms. • In groups, research and compare the Dalton model and Rutherford model of the atom. Explain atomic structure and components of a range of elements and isotopes in a report and on a poster. • In groups, research on and explain in a presentation: • how thermionic emission and the photoelectric effect occur • how cathode rays and X-rays differ. Note: 1) Laws of photoelectric effect are not required; 2) Numerical problems related to acceleration of electrons are beyond this level.
