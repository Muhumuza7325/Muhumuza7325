Theme ***Light*** "@OMD". TOPIC 5 ***REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY CURVED SURFACES*** "8 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should understand how concave and convex mirrors form images, and also be able to describe the uses of these mirrors in everyday life. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand reflection of light and the formation of images by curved mirrors (u); b) Use ray diagrams to show how images are formed by curved mirrors and the nature of the images (s); c) Determine the focal length of concave mirrors using a variety of methods. (s, gs). • In groups, investigate what happens to the reflection when an object is placed at different distances from a curved mirror, and then record results in a table. • In pairs, research what is meant by focal length (f) and curvature (c) and use ray diagrams to explain how a concave mirror can: • focus light from a distant object • produce a magnified real image. • In pairs, discuss the characteristics of images formed by curved mirrors and use either side of a shiny spoon (or actual mirrors) to compare and report on the differences between concave and convex mirrors. • In groups, determine the focal length of concave mirrors and make reports. • In pairs, research on, and explain using diagrams, why curved mirrors are used in optical instruments such as a telescope and in vehicle headlights. Note: a) The relation r=2f should not be derived; b) Image distance should be obtained by scale drawing only and not calculated from the mirror formula; c) Experimental determination of focal length of convex mirrors is not required;
