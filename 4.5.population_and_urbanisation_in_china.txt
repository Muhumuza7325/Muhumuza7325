Theme ***Population and urban development in Africa, and Other parts of the World*** "@OMD". TOPIC 29 ***POPULATION AND URBANISATION IN CHINA*** "14 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the size of China’s population, the history of its growth rate, the one-child population policy and its impacts on the country’s population growth and development. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the total population of China and the changes in her population growth rate (k); b) know the number and size of some urban areas in China (k); c) understand the size and rapid growth of China’s population and reasons for this (u); d) understand the reasons for the adoption of the one child policy in China (u); e) understand the consequences of the one child policy and changes in it (u); f) understand the reasons that lead to rural-urban drift and growth of urban areas in China (u); g) understand the growth of Shanghai as a major city (u); h) understand government control over the growth of urban areas (u); i) use maps, statistics, graphs and diagrams to analyse population (s, gs); j) draw a map to show the major urban areas of China (s); k) understand the methods which can be used to control the rate of population growth (u); l) appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of the one child policy(v, a); m) appreciate the advantages and problems of having a large or rapidly increasing population in a country (v, a); n) appreciate the need for, and use of population control methods (v, a). China’s population and population growth • Use a table to show the population of the world’s biggest countries, and some countries of Africa, as a proportion of the world’s population. Compare the populations and realise the size of China compared to other countries. • use Internet to find figures for the above table. • Using a table or graph of China’s population from about 1900 to the present, describe the growth of population during the period. • use Internet to construct the above table or graph • suggest reasons for the rapid growth and the later decline of the growth rate. Compare these reasons and trend with East Africa and other African countries (rapid growth but no decline in rate). • Explain the rapid growth: due to large birth rate but decreasing death rate due to modern medicine, as in Africa. • Through discussion, understand the one-child policy and its effect on population growth. Explain other social consequences of one child policy: special treatment of one child; abortions of female children as males are more important in culture; imbalance of males and females and not enough females for men to marry. • Through questioning, explore the reasons for the change to the two-child policy. • work in pairs to investigate and research the one-child policy in China on Internet and share the information you have found with your group. Urban areas in China • Using a table of number and size of urban areas in China with large populations, suggest reasons for the increasing size of urban areas based on topic 30 on industrialisation. • Explain the policies used to control rural-urban drift and population migration in China (people need permission to move to urban areas or they do not get social services, including free education). What problems may be avoided by this policy. • In groups, discuss whether this policy would be good in Africa, including Uganda. • Locate Shanghai on the map of China. • Suggest why Shanghai has become a big city. • In pairs or groups, suggest the reasons that led to the growth of Shanghai as a big city. Expand your ideas and point out China’s original growth as a European enclave like Hong Kong;
