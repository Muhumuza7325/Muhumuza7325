Theme ***Further use of maps; introduction to the rest of Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 22 ***THE CLIMATE AND VEGETATION OF AFRICA*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the distribution of climates in Africa, the reasons for the distribution and the effects of these climates on human development. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the relationship between the Earth and the Sun and how this affects temperatures and seasons (u); b) draw diagrams to show the relationship between the Earth and the Sun’s rays and the causes of temperature variations and use these to show why the Earth can be divided into tropical, temperate and polar regions (s); c) understand the characteristics of the climates of Africa and factors influencing them (u); d) appreciate that people’s lifestyles are influenced by the type of weather and climate (v, a); e) understand through case studies how selected climates and types of vegetation affect the way of life of the people in those areas (u); f) draw a map showing the climates and vegetation of East Africa (s); g) draw climate graphs of local and other areas and describe climates using these graphs (s); h) appreciate that the traditional way of life and farming of all people of Africa is strongly influenced by the climates (a, gs); i) appreciate that modern technologies and urbanisation have made people less dependent on the climate. (v, a, gs); j) Understand through fieldwork the characteristics of vegetation and how the vegetation is affected by the climates (u, s); k) appreciate the dangers of the overuse of the natural vegetation (v, a, gs); l) appreciate the need to love and care for their local area, community and country by replanting the vegetation in areas where it has been cleared(v, a); m) understand the main characteristics of the climates and how each affects the vegetation of the area (u); n) understand how the traditional farming and way of life was influenced by the climate (u). Factors affecting the climates of Africa • Through questioning, revise the seasons and apparent movement of the sun. Are the northern and southern hemispheres tilted towards the sun? • Explain that this affects the angle of the sun at midday. In March and September, the sun is overhead at noon on the equator. From March to September it is overhead at noon north of the equator, between equator and Tropic of Cancer. • Revise: What will happen to air when the sun is overhead and what will this cause? (Air will rise, causing convectional rain). • Through questioning, explore how the rising air causes winds to blow from north and south towards the rising air. Show the diagram and map of the winds caused by this situation: north east trades and south east trades. Understand the Inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ): an area of rising air and heavy rain. • look up Inter-tropical Convergence Zone on Internet and find out about its position, seasonal movements and effects on climate. • Through questioning, explore the relationship between the overhead sun, ICTZ, wind movement and rainfall pattern in Africa. • Explain how this relationship affects different climates: equatorial and savannah. • Explain that places outside the tropics have different kinds of climate not affected by the ITCZ. The climates of Africa • Get climate statistics and draw climate graphs for each kind of climate in Africa: equatorial, savannah, desert, Mediterranean. • suggest which climates are in the ITCZ twice a year (equatorial), once a year (savannah) and not at all (desert and Mediterranean). • draw a sketch map showing these climates in Africa • Using the graphs drawn and facts about ICTZ, explain the main climates: • equatorial • savannah • desert • Mediterranean. Note: Mountain climates in high mountain areas: much colder due to height and usually wet due to relief rain. Look up on the Internet each of the above climates in Africa and find the positions and characteristics of each. • Investigate the effects of climate on livelihoods through local scale case studies, and compare the case studies in order to identify some key positive and negative effects of climate. Effects of climate on way of life • Using ideas learnt in East Africa, suggest types of vegetation, farming, crops grown and animals kept in each of the above climatic regions (except Mediterranean—teacher to explain). • Equatorial: tropical rain forest; shifting cultivation or smallholdings: bananas, yams, sweet potatoes, dairy cattle, coffee, cocoa. • savannah: grassland and scattered trees; shifting cultivation or smallholdings: grain crops – maize, sorghum, millet, groundnuts, cattle, goats, cotton and tobacco. Traditional nomadic farming in drier areas. • desert: vegetation only in oases; no crops, nomadic farming with camels, sheep, goats. • Mediterranean: short shrubs, small trees; wheat, maize, olives, grapes • Use photographs of each of the climatic regions or use the Internet to find photographs and decide with reasons, which climatic region is being shown;
