Theme ***Modern physics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 7 ***DIGITAL ELECTRONICS*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; should understand how electronic components combine in digital circuits. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand how resistors are used to make potential dividers in control and logic circuits (u, s); b) understand elementary logic and memory circuits that exploit devices such as bistable and astable switches, logic gates and resistors as potential dividers (u, s); c) know that logic circuits are able to store and process binary information and that this can be exploited in an increasingly wide variety of digital instruments (k, u, s). • In groups, research potential dividers and report on how: • to construct potential dividers using different sized resistors • to measure the potential difference between different points • the volume control on a radio acts as a potential divider and draw a simple circuit to explain how a potential divider works. • In groups, research and prepare a presentation on how: • to construct truth tables for AND, NAND, OR and NOR gates • to use logic gates in control circuits • to construct a bistable switch from two NOR gates and represent this in a diagram • bistable switches may be used in a binary counting circuit • logic circuits store and process binary information, and how digital instruments use binary information.
