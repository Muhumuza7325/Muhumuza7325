Competency; The learner investigates evaporation and condensation as natural processes essential for replenishing supplies of fresh water in the water cycle. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand the occurrence of water as a natural resource, its physical and chemical properties and importance in everyday life (u, s); b) Appreciate how water is recycled by natural processes (u, v); c) Understand the process of water and sewage treatment (u, k). [Group Work 1] {Research about the occurrence of water as a natural resource, its physical and chemical properties and importance in everyday life}. [Group Work 2] {How is water recycled by natural processes}. Water is a chemical compound consisting of oxygen and hydrogen in the ratio of 2:1. Its chemical formula is H₂O. Water is a liquid of fundamental importance to all kinds of plants and animals. Every living organism needs water to survive, thus the slogan, “water is life”. Uses of water. 1) Biological use. All biological processes in living organisms require water as a medium for the reactions. For example, photosynthesis, excretion, transport of materials and transmission of impulses. 2) Domestic use. Drinking, cooking, washing, bathing, mopping, construction, recreation etc. 3) Farm use. Irrigation, for dipping animals, for drinking by animals, for fish farming etc. 4) Industrial use. Water is used as a solvent in many industries, for cleaning, for cooling purposes especially in power stations, used in steam engines, generating hydroelectricity, transportation using boats, ships, etc., and for recreation purposes and construction. 5) Habitat. Aquatic organisms such as fish, crocodiles and water lilies live in water. Occurrence. Pure water does not exist in a natural state, but supplies of water are obtainable all over the world. Water constitutes about 67% of the earth’s surface and occurs in rocks, the atmosphere and in all living organisms. Sources of water: The natural sources of water are rain, spring water, river water, sea water, etc. 1) Rain water. The water originates from rain and it is relatively pure with no dissolved minerals. However, it contains suspended materials and dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Rain water is good for washing as it forms lather easily with soap and does not contain dissolved salts. It is also good for drinking since it has a flat taste. 2) Wells and spring water. The water comes from underground and is obtained by drilling the ground in form of a bore hole or, the water just springs out of the ground. It is actually rain water that has drained into the ground and collected into a pool of underground water. It has less suspended materials but contains dissolved mineral salts, making it good for drinking. It may not be good for washing because of the dissolved mineral salts that delay the formation of lather. 3) River and lake water. The water is obtained from rivers and lakes. It contains both suspended materials and dissolved minerals. As water flows into rivers and lakes, it gathers floating materials and pollutants such as sewage and industrial wastes, so it is not good for washing and drinking. 4) Sea and ocean water. These provide large sources of water. The water contains a lot of suspended materials and dissolved substances. The accumulated mineral salts settle at the bottom of the water and the water may become saturated with the salt. This is why sea water tastes salty. 5) Ice caps. The water is obtained from melting ice and it is relatively pure. The ice formed at the peaks of mountains melts and the water runs down forming springs. The water Cycle. In spite of the fact that a lot of water is used daily domestically, industrially and in irrigation, the amount of water on earth remains fairly constant. Water keeps on changing from one state to another depending on the conditions of the environment. A cycle is a number of changes which go back to the starting point and which can be repeated. The water cycle is the process by which water circulates round the earth. The driving force for the cycle is the sun. Water vapour forms in the air when the sun shines and when wind blows across water. Water vapour in the atmosphere may also result from transpiration processes in plants and respiration processes of all living organisms and burning of starchy food materials forming carbon dioxide and water which are expelled into the atmosphere. Water vapour rises since it is less dense than air. As it rises, it cools. Finally, it is so cold that the vapour condenses forming tiny drops of liquid water. These drops float in the sky and form a cloud. The tiny drops of water in a cloud join together and fall to the ground as rain. The rain water passes into springs, rivers and seas. Once again it evaporates. Water on the earth’s surface is always changing into vapour, going into the air and then falling as rain. Figure237.1.8.water_image_001.jpg. Figure238.1.8.water_image_002.jpg. Video22.Water_Cycle.mp4. Properties of water. Pure water is a clear, colourless and odourless liquid at room temperature. Water is neutral to litmus. At a pressure of 760mmHg, water freezes at 0⁰C. At a pressure of 760mmHg, water boils at 100⁰C at sea level. It boils away completely and does not leave any residue. Water has a density of 1gcm⁻³ at 4⁰C. Water is an excellent solvent; It dissolves practically everything; It is often called a universal solvent. Chemical tests for water. Water can be tested chemically in two ways: 1) By using white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate which turns blue. CuSO₄(s) + 5H₂O(l) → CuSO₄.5H₂O(s). 2) By using blue cobalt (II) chloride paper that turns pink. CoCl₂(s) + 6H₂O(l) → CoCl₂.6H₂O(s). Action of cold water and steam on metals. The reactivity of metals with water is not the same. Some metals react very fast with water while others react very slowly with water. The reaction varies from metal to metal depending on the position of the metal in the reactivity series. Most reactive metals react with water forming a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas is liberated. Potassium: Potassium reacts vigorously with cold water, catches fire and burns with a purple/lilac flame; it floats, melts into a silvery ball and darts (moves rapidly) on the surface of water with a hissing sound and gives off hydrogen gas to form sodium hydroxide solution which turns red litmus blue. It explodes with a pop sound as it disappears. 2K(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H₂(g). NB: It is the intense heat produced that causes potassium to melt (because of its low melting point). Sodium: Sodium reacts vigorously with water. When a piece of sodium is placed in cold water, it floats, melts into a silvery ball and darts on the surface of water with a hissing sound. The sodium gradually becomes smaller and smaller as it reacts with water to produce an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide. The hissing sound is due to evolution of hydrogen gas. 2Na(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g). Note: Sodium usually doesn’t burn when reacting with water, however, if its movement on water is restricted, it burns with a yellow flame. Note: Sodium and Potassium are very reactive elements; For this reason, they are stored under oil to prevent them from coming into contact with air. Video25.Reactivity_of_Alkali_Metals_with_Water.mp4. Calcium: Calcium reacts steadily with water. When a small piece of calcium is dropped in water, it sinks and reacts quietly to form bubbles of hydrogen gas and an alkaline solution that turns red litmus paper blue. The water becomes milky or cloudy because the calcium hydroxide formed is not very soluble in water. Ca(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g). Magnesium: Magnesium sinks to the bottom and reacts very slowly with cold water to produce very few bubbles of hydrogen gas on the surface of the metal and an alkaline solution of magnesium hydroxide. Mg(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g). However, hot magnesium reacts rapidly with steam, burning with a bright white flame, leaving white ash of magnesium oxide. Much heat is evolved and the hydrogen gas produced may burn with a blue flame in air. Conditions for the reaction. (i) A clean piece of magnesium ribbon. The magnesium metal used is first cleaned to remove the oxide coating due to corrosion; (ii) The boiling tube is first heated to drive out all air (oxygen); (iii) Heating water to form steam. The cotton wool soaked in water is heated to release steam that reacts with the heated magnesium. Figure239.1.8.water_image_003.jpg. Hot magnesium catches fire in steam and burns brightly to form a white ash of magnesium oxide. Mg(s) + H₂O(g) → MgO(s) + H₂(g). Video26.Burning_Magnesium_in_water.mp4. Note: Aluminium does not react with water or steam due to the formation of an insoluble oxide layer which prevents contact between water and the metal inhibiting any further reaction. Therefore, the Aluminium foil is first cleaned to remove a coating of oxide film and then reacted with steam at red heat. A colourless gas is given off and a white coating is formed on the foil. 2Al(s) + 3H₂O(l) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3H₂(g). Zinc: Zinc reacts only when heated strongly in steam forming a solid that is yellow when hot and white when cold and hydrogen gas. This solid is zinc oxide. Zn(s) + H₂O(l) → ZnO(s) + H₂(g). Iron: Steam reacts slowly with heated iron to form a blue-black solid (tri-iron tetra oxide). This reaction is reversible and thus can be made to proceed in the reverse direction by passing excess hydrogen over heated tri-iron tetra oxide. 3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g) ↔ Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g). Elements below Iron in the reactivity series do not react with either cold water or even steam. Reaction of water with oxides. Water reacts with some metallic oxides (basic oxides) to form alkaline solutions. Potassium and Sodium oxides react with water to form potassium hydroxide solution and sodium hydroxide solution respectively. Na₂O(s) + H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq). K₂O(s) + H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq). Sodium peroxide reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide solution with effervescence of oxygen gas.  2Na₂O₂(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 4NaOH(aq) + O₂(g). Calcium oxide is slightly soluble in water. CaO(s) + H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq). However, when a few drops of water are added to a piece of calcium oxide at a time, for a little while nothing is observed, water vapour is given off with a hissing sound. The oxide begins to expand, it cracks and finally crumbles to a powder of calcium hydroxide. CaO(s) + H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(s). Magnesium oxide dissolves slightly in water to form magnesium hydroxide solution. MgO(s) + H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂(aq). Other metallic oxides are insoluble in water. With non-metallic oxides (acidic oxides), water forms acidic solutions. CO₂(g) + H₂O(l) ↔ H₂CO₃(aq). SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₃(aq). 2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq). SO₃(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₄(aq). P₂O₅(s) + 3H₂0(l) → 2H₃PO₄(aq). • In groups, draw on prior learning to brainstorm ideas about evaporation and condensation of water, ice, and steam as changes of state, and produce a chart of the water cycle to explain its physical and chemical properties and the role of the sun in providing energy to drive the cycle. [Group Work 3] {Explain the process of water and sewage treatment}. Water pollution. For us to make the best use of water from the various sources, we must learn to use the water sparingly and also keep it clean. Power stations that use river water for cooling for example, shouldn’t dump the water back in the river when it is still hot, since solubility of gases in water decreases with increase in temperature; Warm water from these power stations decreases the solubility of river oxygen content in the water, affecting aquatic life that is dependent on the oxygen. When undesirable materials enter water, the water becomes unsuitable for some purposes and such water is said to be polluted. Pollution is the presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance which has harmful effects to plant and animal life. Substances which bring about pollution are called pollutants. Water pollution is the discharge of unwanted materials or substances into water bodies. Common water pollutants. 1) Industrial wastes e.g., oils, and gases such as sulphur dioxide that dissolve and are washed by rain into water systems. These wastes change the pH of water affecting its quality in terms of taste, colour and smell. Bylaws should be made that protect water bodies. 2) Agricultural wastes e.g., herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers that are washed down the streams. These wastes change the pH of water and the phosphates and nitrates contained in them, aid the growth of algal blooms. The use of inorganic herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers should be minimised. 3) Sewage, mainly from homes and factories which find their way into water systems. Sewage containing excreta breeds germs that cause diseases like cholera, diarrhoea and typhoid. The community should be sensitised on the proper disposal of excreta. 4) Soapless detergents and waste soapy detergents, in homes, saloons and laundries, that may escape into water bodies and have an impact on life in water. The community should be sensitised on the proper disposal of water pollutants. Video27.Water_Pollution.mp4. Water treatment or Water purification. This is the removal of harmful substances from water, making it suitable for domestic use. In Uganda, the treatment of water is done by Uganda National Water and Sewage Co-operation (UNWSC). There are four main stages in the process of water treatment. 1) Screening. This involves the use of screens or wire mesh to remove large floating objects from water. 2) Addition of chemicals (sedimentation and neutralisation). Chemicals are added to the water to remove harmful substances and neutralize acids and bases. The chemicals as well remove hardness of water, precipitate metals and cause suspended solid particles to settle. Sedimentation in particular, involves the clustering together of suspended particles into big lumps which sink and settle at the bottom. Alum (Potassium Aluminium sulphate) which has the ability to cluster particles is added in controlled quantities. 3) Filtration. This involves the removal of suspended particles in water by use of gravel and sand. The last part of the filter bed consists of gravel and sand, which serve as physical filtration media, along with some beneficial microbes that aid in biological filtration by breaking down organic matter and further removing harmful bacteria. 4) Chlorination and fluoridation. This involves addition of minute quantities of chlorine water or fluorine. This destroys bacteria but is harmless to humans. Only a small concentration of chlorine is used because it is harmful. However, in swimming pools, a high concentration of chlorine is used as the water may contain a high bacteria concentration. In some countries, ozone is used instead of chlorine. Water treated with a high concentration of chlorine is not meant for drinking. 5) pH adjustment. Addition of chlorine to water lowers its pH. Soda ash (Na₂CO₃) may be added to normalize the PH of the chlorinated water. Summary of water purification process. Figure240.1.8.water_image_004.jpg. Figure241.1.8.water_image_005.jpg. Video23.The_Water_Treatment_Process.mp4. Sewage. This is water containing waste matter from toilets, bathrooms, sinks, factories and streets of towns. The sewage is normally carried away by underground pipes into prepared areas for treatment. Sewage treatment. The reason for treating sewage is to remove harmful pollutants before allowing it to join water bodies. Different companies and institutions have different procedures for treating sewage. However, sewage treatment generally involves the following steps: 1) Primary settlement tank. Through sieving and sedimentation, solid wastes sink to the bottom and are sent to an anaerobic digester. 2) Anaerobic digester. Anaerobic bacteria digest the sludge, producing methane gas. The digested sludge is sent to an aeration tank. 3) Aeration tank. Liquid from top of the primary settlement tank flows in the aeration tank. Aerobic microorganisms in the aeration tank, further decompose any remaining organic matter, aided by bubbling air. The mixture is sent to the secondary settlement tank. 4) Secondary settlement tank. The mixture undergoes secondary settlement allowing activated sludge to settle out, which is then recycled back to the aeration tank. 5) Effluent. The liquid at the top of the secondary settlement tank which is clear, has no smell and no disease-causing organisms is called an effluent. The effluent is then released into rivers or lakes, adhering to the environmental standards. Figure242.1.8.water_image_006.jpg. Figure243.1.8.water_image_007.jpg. Bio gas and sludge are the two by-products of the sewage works. Bio gas is often used as a fuel for cooking and lighting. Uses of sludge. Road surfacing as it can set into a hard solid. As a fertilizer because it is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. As a raw material to produce biogas. To fill quarries for land reclamation. Video24.Sewage_water_treatment. • In groups, use your water cycle charts, and prior learning about the characteristics of water, to identify and report on where pollution might occur, its causes, impact, and possible ways to prevent it. • Visit a sewage treatment plant and find out how effluent is recycled into useable water. Individually produce report(s) to explain the process of sewage treatment using your prior learning about the characteristics of water. Water in the atmosphere. Many substances absorb water from the air. Such substances are said to be hygroscopic. A hygroscopic substance is one which absorbs water from the atmosphere. Examples of hygroscopic substances include: Anhydrous copper (II) sulphate, calcium oxide (quick lime), concentrated sulphuric acid. Some substances absorb so much water from the atmosphere that they dissolve in it. Such substances are said to be deliquescent. Examples: Calcium chloride, sodium hydroxide, phosphorous pentaoxide, potassium hydroxide, iron (III) chloride. All deliquescent substances are hygroscopic, but hygroscopic substances are not necessarily deliquescent. Deliquescence is the absorption of water from the atmosphere by a solid to form a solution. Water of crystallization. Some substances form crystals that contain water. The water is chemically combined with the substance to form a crystal. A crystal is a solid that has solidified in a definite regular shape. The water comes off when the crystals are heated, and the crystals lose their shape and sometimes colour. A crystalline compound containing water is called hydrated, and the one without water is called anhydrous. Hydrated salts include, copper (II) sulphate crystals (5H₂O of crystallisation), Iron (II) sulphate crystals (7H₂O of crystallisation), magnesium sulphate crystals (7H₂O of crystallisation), sodium carbonate crystals (10H₂O of crystallisation), and sodium sulphate crystals (10H₂O of crystallisation). Water of crystallization is the definite amount of water with which some substances chemically combine when they form crystals from their solutions in water. It is sometimes referred to as water of hydration. Efflorescence. This is the giving up of water of crystallization by a crystal to the atmosphere. An efflorescent is a substance which loses its water of crystallization when exposed to the atmosphere. Please revisit the chapter of mixtures, elements and compounds (Topic 2.3) and harmonise content on crystallisation. We shall cover crystallisation in detail in Form Two. Hardness of water. Water can be classified as hard or soft. Hard water is water which does not readily form lather with soap. Soft water readily forms lather with soap. Examples of soft water include: Rain water, distilled water, deionised water, etc. Examples of hard water include: Tap water, sea water, borehole water, well water, spring water, etc. Compounds that cause hardness of water include: calcium hydrogen carbonate, Ca(HCO₃)₂, magnesium hydrogen carbonate, Mg(HCO₃)₂, calcium chloride, CaCl₂, magnesium chloride, MgCl₂, Calcium sulphate, CaSO₄ and Magnesium sulphate (MgSO₄). Effects of magnesium and calcium ions on soap. Soap is a sodium or potassium salt of a long chain carboxylic acid. It is known as sodium stearate (Na-st) or potassium stearate (K-st). Soap reacts with magnesium or calcium ions to form dirty white solids called scum. So, when hard water is used for washing, a lot of soap is used because part of the soap initially reacts with calcium and magnesium ions to form scum. Soap reacts with hard water according to the following equations. CaSO₄(aq) + 2Na-St(aq) → Ca-St₂(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq). Ionic equation: Ca₂⁺(aq) + 2St⁻( aq) → Ca-St₂(s). Mg(HCO₃)₂(aq) + 2Na-St(aq) → Mg-St₂(s) + 2NaHCO₃(aq). Ionic equation: Mg₂⁺(aq) + 2St⁻(aq) → Mg-St₂(s). How water becomes hard. (a) Rain dissolves carbondioxide as it falls, forming dilute carbonic acid, which makes it acidic. H₂O(l) + CO₂(g) ↔ H₂CO₃(aq). This acidic water, when passing through rocks containing calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate, reacts with some of these carbonates. The carbonates react with the carbonic acid to produce soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate or magnesium hydrogen carbonate. CaCO₃(s) + H₂CO₃(aq) → Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq). MgCO₃(s) + H₂CO₃(aq) → Mg(HCO₃)₂(aq). (b) When the acidic water passes rocks containing calcium sulphate or magnesium sulphate, dissolution occurs, releasing calcium ions or magnesium ions along with sulphate ions into the water. This makes the water hard because calcium and magnesium ions in solution react with soap and stop it from forming lather readily. Types of water hardness. Water is said to be hard if it contains calcium or magnesium ions. There are two types of water hardness. 1) Temporary hardness. This type of hardness is caused by the presence of dissolved magnesium hydrogen carbonate or calcium hydrogen carbonate in water and can be removed by boiling. 2) Permanent hardness. This type of hardness is caused by the presence of magnesium sulphate or magnesium chloride or calcium sulphate or calcium chloride in water which cannot be decomposed by boiling hence ‘permanent’. Removal of water hardness. Temporary hardness of water can be removed by the following methods. 1) Boiling: Boiling decomposes calcium hydrogen carbonate and magnesium hydrogen carbonate to form insoluble calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate respectively. The insoluble carbonates are filtered off leaving soft water. The calcium and magnesium carbonates may be deposited as solids as boiler scales or kettle fur. Ca(HCO₃)₂ (aq) → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g). Mg(HCO₃)₂(aq) → MgCO₃(s) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g). The boiler scale or fur produced is an insulator hence a lot of heat is required for boiling, and this wastes a lot of fuel or electricity. The fur produced may also block pipes carrying boiled water and possibly causing them to burst. Figure195.2.4.carbon_in_the_environment_image_022.jpg. Figure196.2.4.carbon_in_the_environment_image_023.jpg. Figure197.2.4.carbon_in_the_environment_image_024.jpg. By chemical means: 2) Addition of mineral acids like hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid that react with the soluble magnesium or calcium hydrogen carbonates to form a salt, water and carbondioxide. Ca(HCO₃)₂(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl₂(aq) + 2CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). 3) Addition of calcium hydroxide (lime water): Calculated quantity of calcium hydroxide is used to remove temporary hardness of water. It reacts with the soluble magnesium or calcium hydrogen carbonates to form insoluble magnesium and calcium carbonates respectively. Ca(OH)₂(aq) + Ca(HCO₃)₂ (aq) → 2CaCO₃(s) + 2H₂O(l). This method is cheaper than boiling as calcium hydroxide is readily available. However, when excess lime water is used, the water becomes hard again. 4) Addition of aqueous Ammonia: This precipitates out calcium or magnesium carbonate. Mg(HCO₃)₂(aq) + 2NH₃(aq) → MgCO₃(s) + (NH₄)₂CO₃(aq). Methods of removing both temporary and permanent hardness. 5) Distillation. Distillation of water removes all hardness; water is boiled to form steam which is condensed to form pure and soft water. Solid impurities are left in the distillation flask. However, it can only be used on a small scale because it is expensive. 6) Addition of sodium carbonate (washing soda). This precipitates insoluble calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate which can be filtered off. CaSO₄(aq) + Na₂CO₃(aq) → CaCO₃(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq). Mg(HCO₃)₂(aq) + Na₂CO₃(aq) → MgCO₃(s) + 2NaHCO₃(aq). The method is very cheap and easy to carry out on a large scale. Disadvantages of using sodium carbonate; The reaction forms insoluble carbonates which stain the clothes. Sodium carbonate hydrolyses in water to form an alkali which attacks the skin. 7) By passing water through permutit (Sodium aluminium silicate, Na₂Y). The calcium and magnesium ions in hard water can be exchanged with sodium ions using a suitable ion exchange material. This makes the water to become soft. The common ion exchange materials are zeolites and permutit. Zeolites are natural occurring forms of sodium aluminium silicate and permutit is the artificial form. Zeolite/permutit can be represented by the formula Na₂Y. Permutit is normally packed in a container and hard water is allowed to pass through it. MgSO₄(aq) + Na₂Y(aq) → MgY(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq). Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq) + Na₂Y(aq) → CaY(s) + NaHCO₃(aq). This method works on the principle of ion exchange. During the process, calcium and magnesium ions are removed from water and they appear as precipitates of aluminium silicate. The advantage here is that, the permutit can be recovered and used several times. Distinguishing between permanent hard water, temporary hard water and soft water. Procedure: Place equal volumes of each unboiled water samples in three different conical flasks. Run soap solution from the burette into each sample while shaking the conical flask vigorously until when lather forms. Take note of the volume of soap solution required to form lather with each of the unboiled water samples. Figure244.1.8.water_image_008.jpg. Results: The soft water required the least volume of soap solution to form lather compared to the samples of hard water. Repeat the above procedure with the boiled water samples. Results: Soft water required approximately the same volume of soap solution to form lather as the unboiled soft water. Temporary hard water after boiling required less volume of soap solution to form lather than the unboiled one. This is because the water was made soft by boiling and thus formed lather readily. Permanent hard water, even after boiling, required the same volume of soap solution as the unboiled to form lather. This is because even after boiling, the water still remained hard and took time to form lather. Sample Results: Figure245.1.8.water_image_009.jpg. Advantages of hard water include: Hard water is rich in calcium which builds strong bones and teeth. Calcium in hard water is responsible for the formation of strong shells of many animals e.g., snails and egg shells. Magnesium in hard water is important for photosynthesis since it is used for the formation of chlorophyll. Hard water has a good taste and it is used in the brewing industry. Hard water prevents lead poisoning and it is the only type of water transported by lead pipes. Disadvantages of hard water include: Hard water wastes soap due to formation of scum. Causes dirty marks on clothes due to scum and also damages silk and nylon. Causes fur in kettles and pans leading to wastage of fuel; Fur is a bad conductor of heat. Causes wrong colours in the dyeing process and poor finish during leather tanning. Causes formation of boiler scale which wastes fuel because it’s a bad conductor of heat. The boiler scales may also block the pipes carrying boiling water hence causing the pipes to burst. Exercise. 1) Explain why soap does not form lather readily at first with hard water and then eventually forms the lather? 2) Explain what is meant by hardness of water. What are the causes of temporary and permanent hardness of water? How do these compounds that cause hardness of water reach the water? 3) Explain in detail why a white precipitate is formed when: i) Carbondioxide is blown into lime water; ii) Temporary hard water is boiled; iii) Washing soda is added to water containing dissolved magnesium chloride. HYDROGEN. Hydrogen is the smallest element and the lightest gas. It is the first element in the periodic table of elements. Hydrogen usually does not occur naturally in a Free State (except when it is in negligible quantities) but in combined states as water, acid, hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. In nature, hydrogen exists as a diatomic molecule, meaning one molecule contains two atoms. The major source of hydrogen in nature is water. Laboratory preparation of hydrogen. Hydrogen is prepared in the laboratory by the action of either dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulphuric acid on zinc granules or zinc metal. Note: When preparing hydrogen in the laboratory, zinc granules are used instead of pure zinc, because some impurities in the zinc granules act as catalysts. Figure246.1.8.water_image_010.jpg. Dilute sulphuric acid is added to zinc granules in a flask through the thistle funnel. A little copper (II) Sulphate solution is added as a catalyst to speed up the reaction. Effervescence occurs as hydrogen gas is produced and collected over water. If the gas is required dry, it is passed through a wash bottle containing concentrated sulphuric acid or a U-tube containing fused calcium chloride and collected by upward delivery (downward displacement of air), as its less dense than air. Figure247.1.8.water_image_011.jpg. Equation: Zn(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). Other metals that can be used instead of zinc are iron and magnesium. Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq) → FeCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). Industrial manufacture of hydrogen. On a large scale, hydrogen gas is manufactured by the Bosch process. The raw materials used include coke and steam. Steam is passed over hot coke to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas. C(s) + H₂O(g) → CO(g) + H₂(g). A combination of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas is water gas. The carbon monoxide is absorbed in another chemical, leaving hydrogen gas behind. Physical properties of Hydrogen. It’s a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas. It’s neutral to litmus paper. It’s less dense than air. It is the lightest substance known, air is 14.5 times denser. It is only slightly soluble in water. Test for hydrogen. A mixture of hydrogen and air explodes with a ‘pop’ when lighted. When a burning splint is brought into a gas jar of hydrogen, the splint will be extinguished with a pop sound. 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g). Chemical reactions of Hydrogen. 1) Combustion. Hydrogen burns quietly with a pale blue flame in air forming water vapour. The gaseous product can be condensed in a cool environment to form a colourless liquid that turns white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate to blue indicating that it is water. This reaction is very dangerous because it leads to the explosion of the test tube. 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g). Figure248.1.8.water_image_012.jpg. 2) Reducing Action. Hydrogen is a reducing agent. It removes oxygen from the oxides of some metals, reducing them to the metals and itself is oxidized to water. An oxide is a compound formed between a metal or non-metal with oxygen. When dry hydrogen is passed over heated CuO in a combustion tube, a red glow spreads through the black oxide that then turns to brown as the oxide is reduced to the brown copper metal and a colourless liquid that turns white anhydrous copper II sulphate blue, forms on the cooler parts of the tube. Figure249.1.8.water_image_013.jpg. CuO(s) + H₂(g) → Cu(s) + H₂O(g). Hydrogen also reduces Lead (II) Oxide, Iron (III) oxide and Tri-iron tetra oxide. PbO(s) + H₂(g) → Pb(s) + H₂O(g). Fe₂O₃(s) + 3H₂(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3H₂O(g). Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g) ↔ 3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g). Reduction can be defined as the addition of hydrogen to a substance or the removal of oxygen from a substance. Oxidation can be defined as the removal of hydrogen from a substance or the addition of oxygen to a substance. Precautions. a) Dry hydrogen gas must be used. b) The combustion tube must be in a slanting position so as to prevent the water formed from running back to the hot part of the tube. c) Hydrogen should be passed through the combustion tube to expel out air before heating the oxide. d) Hydrogen should be passed through the tube for some time after heating. This prevents re-oxidation of the copper. e) The excess hydrogen should be burnt to prevent explosion with air. 3) A mixture of chlorine and hydrogen appears not to react at room temperature, but when exposed to sunlight or heated, the mixture explodes forming misty fumes of hydrogen chloride gas. H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g). When hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in water, it becomes hydrochloric acid. 4) Reaction with reactive metals. Hydrogen reacts with highly reactive metals to form hydrides. For example, sodium reacts with hydrogen to form sodium hydride. Na(s) + ½H₂(g) → NaH(s). 5) Reaction of hydrogen with nitrogen. Hydrogen reacts with nitrogen at 500⁰C and 200atm to form ammonia gas. This is a reversible reaction, that is also known as the harber process. 3H₂(g) + N₂(g) ↔ 2NH₃(g). 6) Reaction of hydrogen with sulphur. Hydrogen reacts with sulphur forming hydrogen sulphide gas which has a smell of a rotten egg. H₂(g) + S(s) → H₂S(g). Uses of hydrogen. Hardening of oils in fats to make margarine and cooling fats like blue band. This process is called hydrogenation. During this process, oil is converted to margarine by reacting it with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, nickel, at 180⁰C and 2atm. The oil absorbs hydrogen to form fats. Manufacture of Ammonia by the Haber process. Ammonia is an important gas because it is used in the manufacture of fertilizers, nitric acid and explosives. During this process, hydrogen is reacted with nitrogen gas to give ammonia in the presence of iron as a catalyst. It’s used in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. In this process, hydrogen is reacted with chlorine to form hydrogen chloride gas. When hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in water, it becomes hydrochloric acid. It is used in an oxy-hydrogen flame which is very hot for cutting and wielding steel. It is used to fill weather balloons because of its lightness. It is used in the manufacture of hydrogen bombs. It is used in converting coal into synthetic petrol. It is used as a rocket fuel;
