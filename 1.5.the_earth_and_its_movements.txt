Theme ***Introduction to Geography*** "@OMD". TOPIC 5 ***THE EARTH AND ITS MOVEMENTS*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the relationship between the Earth and the sun and the effects these have on our lives. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the relationship between the Earth and the sun and how this affects temperatures and seasons (u); b) draw diagrams to show the relationship between the Earth and the sun’s rays and the causes of temperature variations and use these to show why the Earth can be divided into tropical, temperate and polar regions (s); c) understand how the rotation causes day and night (u); d) know how we can locate places on a globe by using a grid including the use of latitude and longitude. (u); e) use and measure latitude and longitude (s); f) calculate time using longitude (s); g) appreciate how the movement of the Earth in relation to the Sun affects the way people live; the effect of temperatures and seasons, lengths of day and night (a, v, gs). • Give a set of ‘True’ and ‘False’ statements about the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the sun and carry out research in groups to identify the correct answers. Use your chosen facts to illustrate a demonstration of the Earth in motion over a twenty-four hour and yearly cycle, using models and oral explanation. • work in groups to: • investigate, using a globe or football and light source, how the energy from the sun reaches different parts of the Earth when it is tilted on its axis and in orbit around the sun. • explain this verbally and use relevant vocabulary. • Individually, draw your own diagrams and label them, writing a short explanation of how temperature variation occurs over the Earth throughout the year and how this causes different climatic zones. • In groups, write a set of questions for another group about the Earth’s relationship to the sun and then take it in turns to ask each other. • play globe-tossing games using a blow-up globe and respond to questions about latitude and longitude with increasing difficulty, developing your own questions to ask each other. • investigate webcams in different cities, East and West of where you are, to compare time zones and describe what is happening there; use a map of world time zones to help make the comparison. Rotation of the Earth • Guide to explore that the Earth moves, not the sun – proved by scientists like Copernicus • Using a globe or football, spin round to show the axis. The Earth spins on an axis. • In which direction are we moving in relation to the sun: at sunset, at sunrise? • Where are we in relation to the sun: in daytime; at night? • Demonstrate this with a globe or football and light source. Revolution of the Earth • Explain that the Earth revolves or moves round the sun once a year • Demonstrate this with a globe or ball moved round the classroom with a source of light in the middle. • Demonstrate and draw diagrams to show the meaning of the axis being tilted. • Demonstrate through questions that poles do not move and equator moves round fastest. • Move tilted globe or ball, with poles marked, round the ‘sun’. Which parts of the Earth are tilted towards or away from the sun at different times. (April – August – north tilted towards, south away; October – February – south tilted towards, north away. March and September: sun overhead at equator). • When will it be hotter or colder: when we are tilted away or towards the sun? • Explain and demonstrate that this causes seasons: Hot or summer when tilted towards sun, and cold or winter when titled away from sun. • Explain spring: moving from winter to summer; and autumn (American: fall): moving from summer to winter. • Why do places near equator not have hot and cold seasons. • Move globe or ball to position when north is tilted towards the sun: for how long will a place near the North Pole be in the sun; for how long will a place near the South Pole be in the sun? • Explain the different lengths of day and night in summer and winter. • research on the Internet for any sets of diagrams or pictures which explain the seasons. Latitude and longitude • Ask how we use lines on a map to find places. Use grid. • Explain that we can draw lines on a globe like a grid on a map, but they are circles. • Demonstrate with globe and diagrams: lines going around the world through north and south poles are longitude; lines going around at right angles to these are largest half way from the poles (the equator) and get smaller towards the poles. • Draw a diagram to show how latitudes and longitudes are measured by angles. • Identify examples of longitude and latitude of places in Uganda using atlas maps. • use atlas maps to practise latitude and longitude. • Explain through demonstration and questioning special lines using globe and light source as above: • Sun’s rays come from directly overhead near equator. Tropics of Cancer (north) and Capricorn (south) are the farthest away from the equator where the sun is overhead only one day a year. • When Earth is tilted away from sun in winter, places near the poles will not see the sun. When Earth is tilted towards the sun in summer, places near the poles will receive sun for 24 hours. The Arctic (north) and Antarctic (south) circles show areas where this happens at least one day per year. Time • Demonstrate: if Earth rotates round once in 24 hours: how many degrees does it go through: in 24 hours? In 1 hour? The Earth moves round on its axis completely i.e., 360⁰ in 24 hours, so 15⁰ in 1 hour. • Using diagrams, explore how time is measured from a line of longitude which passes through Greenwich in London. When it is noon at Greenwich, we count how many degrees we are east or west of Greenwich e.g., Uganda is about 45⁰ east of Greenwich. So how many hours does the sun reach us before Greenwich? We can find the time in any place by knowing our own time and adding 1 hour for every 15⁰ if the place is east of us and subtracting 1 hour for every 15⁰ if the place is west of us. • do some exercises to find time in different places. • search the Internet to find maps of world time zones;
