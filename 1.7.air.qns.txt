One of the two major components of air basing on their percentage compositions, today, many hospitals in Uganda do not have enough of it to support the life of Ugandans who are in need of this component. The government of Uganda wanted an investor who can produce it locally. Guide the investor on how he can carry out the process.;
Qn. 1) With reasons, explain why air is referred to as a mixture and not a compound
2) Explain in detail, how the different gases in air can be separated
3) Explain the importance of air
4) Explain processes such as burning and rusting/corrosion that use oxygen from the air to form oxides. Include word or molecular equation (s) for rusting and for the reaction between elements (metals and non-metals) and oxygen when they burn or corrode to form oxides
5) What are the conditions necessary for rusting to take place. Plan an investigation of the factors that affect the rate of rusting of iron, using the scientific method
6) What is air pollution, how does it occur and how can it affect the atmosphere.;
