Theme ***Locomotion in animals*** "@OMD". TOPIC 8.1 ***LOCOMOTION IN MAMMALS*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands how muscles and the skeleton interact to produce movement in mammals. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the structure and functions of the skeleton in supporting the human body (k, u); b) identify and describe the bones that form the two divisions of the human skeleton (k, u, s); c) understand how the action of muscles on the skeleton causes movements in animals (u, s); d) understand the causes, effects and preventive measures of muscle cramps (u). [Assignment 1] {Explore the structure and functions of the skeleton in supporting the human body}. Locomotion is the movement of the whole organism from one place to another. Living organisms locomote for various reasons, such as to look for food, search for mates, escape from enemies or predators, avoid competition for resources, colonise new areas, and seek favourable climatic conditions. With few exceptions, locomotion is brought about by the contraction of muscles against some kind of skeleton. The musculoskeletal system is therefore the basis of locomotion and we must start by looking at its arrangement in different animals. Three types of skeletons are recognised: The one you are probably most familiar with is that found in all vertebrates, including yourself. This is the endoskeleton, so-called because the skeletal elements, bone or cartilage, are internal to the muscles which are attached to them. Thus, in our own limbs, the bones are ensheathed by the muscles that move them (e.g., in the arm, the biceps and triceps muscles are external to the humerus). A rather different arrangement is found in arthropods (insects, lobsters, etc). Here the hard cuticle performs the function of a skeleton which, as it lies outside the muscles, is called an exoskeleton. For example, the flexor and extensor muscles of an insect's leg are enclosed within the box-like exoskeleton to which they are attached. Despite this structural distinction, both endo- and exoskeletons are jointed and operate on the same principles. A totally different system is found in soft-bodied invertebrates like sea anemones and earthworms. In these animals, there is no hard skeleton at all, its place being taken by a fluid under pressure. This fluid functions as a hydrostatic skeleton, being surrounded by muscles which contract against it. Note that for this level, all focus will be put on locomotion in mammals. The skeleton serves several crucial functions that are integral to the proper functioning of the body. It provides protection by shielding vital organs; for example, the skull safeguards the brain, while the ribcage protects the heart and lungs, reducing the risk of injury. The skeleton also allows for muscle attachment, as bones provide surfaces for muscles to anchor to, facilitating movement. Tendons connect muscles to bones, and when muscles contract, they pull on the bones, producing various movements. Additionally, the skeleton is involved in the manufacture of blood cells through a process called haematopoiesis, which occurs in the red bone marrow within bones such as the femur and the pelvic bones. In these locations, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are produced, each playing vital roles in oxygen transport, immune defense, and blood clotting, respectively. The skeleton also provides the structural framework that supports the body’s shape and posture, with the vertebral column supporting the upper body and allowing for an upright posture while serving as a central axis for the body’s other bones and muscles. Moreover, the skeleton stores important minerals like calcium and phosphorus, essential for bone strength and metabolic functions. It plays a role in the adjustment of the thoracic cavity’s volume during breathing through the rib cage, aids in sound transmission via ear ossicles, and contributes to the physical digestion of food through teeth, which are bony structures. Each of these functions works in tandem to ensure the body remains protected, mobile, and capable of essential life processes, highlighting the skeleton’s critical role in overall bodily function and health. Note: Functions of skeleton limited to: protection, muscle attachment, manufacture of blood cells, support and provision of body framework, with a brief illustration of example(s) in each case. Video85.Human_skeletal_system_functions.mp4. [Assignment 2] {Identify and describe the bones that form the two divisions of the human skeleton}. The human skeleton is a complex framework composed of approximately 270 bones at birth, which fuse to form 206 bones in adult humans, along with cartilage, ligaments, and tendons, accounting for about 20% of the total body mass. The axial skeleton, consisting of 80 bones, includes the skull, vertebral column (backbone, or spine), ribcage, and associated bones, including the hyoid bone, auditory ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes), and the sternum, forming the central core and protecting vital organs. The appendicular skeleton, comprising 126 bones, includes the limbs (arms and legs) and girdles (pectoral and pelvic girdles) that attach the limbs to the axial skeleton, facilitating movement and interaction with the environment. Figure286.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_001.jpg. In summary, the 206 bones in the human body include 22 skull bones, 6 ear ossicles, 1 hyoid, 26 vertebrae, 24 ribs, 1 sternum, 2 clavicles, 2 scapulae, 2 humeri, 2 radii, 2 ulnae, 16 carpals, 10 metacarpals, 28 phalanges (hand), 2 hip bones, 2 femora, 2 patellae, 2 tibiae, 2 fibulae, 14 tarsals, 10 metatarsals, and 28 phalanges (foot). Video86.Skeleton_bones_song.mp4. Axial skeleton: Comprising 80 bones, this division forms the central axis of the body, providing support, protection, and structure. It is divided into three major regions: the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage. The skull consists of 22 bones: 8 cranial bones (e.g., frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital) that encase the brain and 14 facial bones (e.g., maxilla, mandible, zygomatic) that form the face. These bones are joined by sutures, immovable joints that provide strength and stability. Additionally, the auditory ossicles—6 tiny bones (3 in each ear: malleus, incus, and stapes)—are included in the axial skeleton and play a crucial role in amplifying sound waves as they transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. Note: The stapes is the smallest bone in the human body. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord and supports the body's weight. While initially comprising 32 to 34 individual vertebrae during childhood, it fuses into 26 bones in adulthood: 7 cervical vertebrae (neck), 12 thoracic vertebrae (upper back), and 5 lumbar vertebrae (lower back). The sacrum (formed by the fusion of 5 sacral vertebrae) and the coccyx (tailbone) (formed by the fusion of 3–5 coccygeal vertebrae) complete the column. In humans, the coccyx is a vestigial structure, representing a remnant of a tail, and serves as an attachment point for ligaments and muscles. Figure287.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_002.jpg. The vertebrae articulate with one another by small pads of cartilage called intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers. An exception to this is the first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas and axis, which do not have intervertebral discs between them; instead, they form a unique pivot joint that allows for a greater range of motion in the neck. Vertebrae are held together by ligaments that prevent their dislocation but permit some movement, hence the vertebral column is flexible. They feature various parts that provide critical points for muscle and ligament attachment, facilitating movement and spinal stability. The spinous process, a bony projection that can be felt along the back, and the transverse processes, which extend from the sides, serve as primary attachment sites for muscles such as the trapezius, erector spinae, and intertransversarii, which stabilise the body. The superior and inferior articular processes further anchor muscles and ligaments essential for maintaining spinal stability. The neural arch encircles the spinal cord and, along with the pedicles connecting it to the vertebral body (also known as the centrum), offers additional attachment points for muscles and ligaments. Additionally, the laminae and, to a lesser extent, the vertebral body provide surfaces for muscle attachment, supporting posture and spinal alignment. These features vary across the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, reflecting the specific functional demands of each section. Notably, the first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas and axis, differ significantly from the rest of the vertebrae in both structure and function. The atlas (C1) lacks a vertebral body and spinous process, consisting of a ring-like structure that supports the skull and facilitates nodding movements such as "yes." The axis (C2) features a unique bony projection called the dens (or odontoid process), which extends upward into the atlas, forming a pivot joint that allows rotational movements, such as shaking the head to say "no." These specialised adaptations enable the skull's wide range of motion, distinguishing them from the other vertebrae designed primarily for support and flexibility along the spinal column. Furthermore, the mammillary processes and accessory processes found in lumbar vertebrae, along with the metapophysis and hypapophysis, provide additional sites for muscle attachment, enhancing overall spinal stability. Collectively, these components of the vertebral column play a crucial role in supporting the body, facilitating movement, and protecting the spinal cord, thereby maintaining overall spinal health and function. Figure288.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_003.jpg. Figure289.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_004.jpg. Figure290.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_005.jpg. Figure291.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_006.jpg. Video89.Vertebrae.mp4. Video90.Identifying_a_vertebra.mp4. The ribcage is composed of 25 bones: 12 pairs of ribs, the sternum (breastbone), and costal cartilage. It provides protection for vital organs such as the heart and lungs and plays a role in respiration (by expanding and contracting to facilitate the movement of air into and out of the lungs). Each rib is classified into three categories: true ribs (first seven pairs), which attach directly to the sternum; false ribs (eighth to tenth pairs), which connect indirectly to the sternum via costal cartilage; and floating ribs (eleventh and twelfth pairs), which do not attach to the sternum at all. Figure292.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_007.jpg. A typical rib bone has distinct external features, each contributing to its structure and function. The head or capitulum, located at the posterior end, has facets that articulate with the thoracic vertebrae at the costovertebral joint. Connected to the head is the neck, a narrow section leading to the tubercle, which features an articular facet for the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra at the costotransverse joint. The angle of the rib marks the point of greatest curvature, contributing to the ribcage’s shape and flexibility. The shaft, or body, is the long, curved part of the rib, with a costal groove along its inner surface that protects intercostal nerves and blood vessels. At its anterior end, the rib connects to costal cartilage, which links directly or indirectly to the sternum, enabling flexibility during breathing. These well-defined features collectively allow the rib to support, protect, and facilitate respiratory movement effectively. The sternum consists of three parts: the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. It serves as the central anchor point for the ribs and plays a crucial role in protecting the heart, lungs, and other vital organs within the thoracic cavity. Note: The axial skeleton also includes the hyoid bone, a single U-shaped bone in the neck that supports the tongue and is not directly connected to any other bone, facilitating swallowing by providing an anchor point for muscles involved in the movement of the tongue and larynx, assisting in speech production by allowing for the proper positioning of the tongue and vocal cords, and serving as a site for muscle attachment that supports the neck and maintains the airway during breathing. Practical: You are provided with specimens W, X, Y and Z which are from the same mammal. Giving two reasons in each case, identify the specimens. Specimen W is a rib bone because it has a head, a neck, a tubercle, and a hard, curved shaft. Specimen X is a lumbar vertebra because it has a large and robust body, a triangular vertebral foramen, thicker and more robust pedicles, broad plate-like laminae, a broad and short spinous process projecting posteriorly, long and robust transverse processes, large articular facets on the superior and inferior articular processes, metapophysis extending from the superior articular process, hypapophysis on the inferior aspect of the vertebral body, and the presence of mammillary and accessory processes. Specimen Y is a thoracic vertebra because it has a wide circular vertebral foramen, a long spinous process that is angled downwards, demifacets for rib articulation on the body, articular facets on transverse processes for rib movement, along with a heart-shaped body. Specimen Z is a cervical vertebra because it has a small, oval body, a large triangular vertebral foramen, short and divided transverse processes (though not all cervical vertebrae have bifid transverse processes), transverse foramina for the passage of vertebral arteries and veins, spinal grooves (also known as vertebral notches) on either side of the transverse processes, and a bifid spinous process. Examine the specimens and list down the characteristic features of each in a table.Basing on the characteristic features stated above, what are the functions of each specimen. Specimen W: Has a head for articulating with the thoracic vertebrae at the costovertebral joint. Has a narrow neck for connecting to the tubercle, which features an articular facet for the transverse process at the costotransverse joint.

Has mammillary processes and accessory processes that offer further points for muscle attachment, enhancing the overall stability of the lumbar spine. Specimen Y: Has a thick heart-shaped body that provides stability and support for the upper body's weight while allowing for articulation with the ribs. Has a wide vertebral foramen that allows for the passage of the spinal cord. Has a robust and rigid neural arch that protects the spinal cord. Has a long, downward-angled spinous process that projects posteriorly, increasing the surface area for the attachment of muscles and ligaments. Has transverse processes that feature articular facets, connecting with the ribs at the costotransverse joint, facilitating rib movement during respiration. Has demifacets on the vertebral body, allowing for the articulation of rib heads at the costovertebral joints, accommodating the thoracic cage's function in respiration. Specimen Z: Has a small, oval body for adequate support while minimising weight and allowing for flexibility. Has a large vertebral foramen that accommodates the spinal cord, ensuring protection while allowing for the passage of nerve roots. Has divided transverse processes (anterior and posterior tubercles) to increase the surface area for muscle attachment. The transverse processes are equipped with transverse foramina, allowing for the passage of the vertebral arteries and veins, which supply blood to the brain. Has spinal grooves (also known as vertebral notches) on either side of the transverse processes that accommodate the spinal nerves, providing a passage for their exit from the vertebral column. Has a bifid spinous process to increase the surface area for attachment of muscles and ligaments, enhancing stability and movement. The neural arch has a hard and rigid structure that encircles the spinal cord, providing crucial protection. The superior and inferior articular processes have a role in articulating with adjacent vertebrae, forming zygapophysial joints that enable a significant range of rotational and lateral movement. Which specimen does specimen W articulate with? Specimen W, identified as a rib bone, articulates with the thoracic vertebrae. The head of the rib connects to the costal facets on the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae at the costovertebral joint, allowing for stability and movement. Additionally, the tubercle of the rib articulates with the transverse process of the corresponding thoracic vertebra at the costotransverse joint, facilitating the rib's role in the respiratory mechanics and providing support to the thoracic cage. Basing on the observed features, state the region of the animal where each specimen was obtained. Specimen W: The rib bone is characteristic of the thoracic region of the animal's body. The rib articulates with the thoracic vertebrae and is part of the rib cage, which protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs. Specimen X: The lumbar vertebra is part of the lower back region of the animal, specifically located in the lumbar section of the vertebral column. The long transverse processes and a broad and short spinous process are typical of the lumbar region, which supports much of the body's weight. Specimen Y: The thoracic vertebra is part of the mid-back region, between the cervical and lumbar vertebrae. It has features that articulate with the ribs, indicating its position in the thoracic region of the vertebral column. Specimen Z: The cervical vertebra is located in the neck region of the animal. The short, divided transverse processes and presence of transverse foramina for the passage of vertebral arteries and veins are typical of the cervical region, which supports the head and facilitates movement and flexibility of the neck. Using the characteristic features in your table, construct a dichotomous key. Make a drawing of each specimen in the space provided. The appendicular skeleton: Comprising 126 bones, this division includes the bones of the limbs and the girdles that attach them to the axial skeleton, enabling movement and interaction with the environment. Pectoral girdle: Consists of the 2 clavicles (collarbones) and 2 scapulae (shoulder blades), which connect the arms to the trunk. (Total: 4 bones). Upper limbs: Include the 2 humeri (upper arm bones), 2 radii, and 2 ulnae (forearm bones), 16 carpals (wrist bones), 10 metacarpals (bones of the hand), and 28 phalanges (finger bones). (Total: 60 bones). Pelvic girdle: Formed by 2 hip bones, each consisting of the ilium, ischium, and pubis (Total: 2 bones). Note: The pelvic girdle, sacrum and coccyx collectively form the pelvis, which connects the legs to the trunk, supports the body’s weight during standing and movement, protects pelvic organs, facilitates movement of the lower limbs, assists in childbirth, and contains red bone marrow for blood cell production through haematopoiesis. Lower limbs: Include the 2 femora (thigh bones), 2 patellae (kneecaps), 2 tibiae, and 2 fibulae (lower leg bones), 14 tarsals (ankle bones), 10 metatarsals (bones of the foot), and 28 phalanges (toe bones). (Total: 60 bones). Each of these bones contributes to the body’s structure, protection, movement, and stability, allowing the skeleton to perform essential functions. Note: The femur is the largest bone in the body. Video87.The_skeletal_system_anatomy.mp4. • In groups, research the structure of the human skeleton using a 3D model, your own bodies, diagrams, animations, and other online resources in order to: • identify the two divisions of the skeleton • name the bones that form the appendicular and axial skeleton • identify the regions of the axial skeleton • draw and label examples of cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae • identify the parts for muscle attachment on the vertebrae. [Assignment 3] {Explore how the action of muscles on the skeleton, causes movements in animals}. Locomotion in any animal involves three key considerations: propulsion, support, and stability, with the specifics depending on whether the animal moves in water, on land, or in the air. In tetrapods, such as mammals, propulsion is achieved through the action of muscles that act as levers to create forward motion. The medium of air provides little or no support, so limbs serve as struts to hold the body off the ground. While early tetrapods had splayed limbs, mammals have evolved to position their limbs directly under the body, improving efficiency. Stability is a significant challenge during movement and is maintained by adjusting the centre of gravity, aided by reflexes and coordinated limb movements. This adaptability is evident in animals like horses and kangaroos, which remain stable even when periodically lifting their legs. Additionally, the ability to stand permanently on the hind legs (bipedalism) has been a crucial development in human evolution, allowing for greater mobility and the ability to navigate various environments effectively. The musculoskeletal system of tetrapods is adapted to withstand the forces of movement, ensuring efficient transmission of forces and overall functionality. Limb bones, such as the femur, are designed for strength and lightness, with compact bone reinforcing stress-bearing areas. The bones, connected by ligaments that provide strength and stability, serve as rigid frameworks, while muscles, composed of muscle fibres and attached to bones via tendons that stretch less easily and are generally less strong than ligaments, produce the force needed for movement. Muscle fibres are the contractile units within muscles, enabling them to generate force and facilitate movement. Additionally, fascia is a connective tissue that surrounds and separates muscles and muscle groups, providing support and facilitating movement by connecting muscles to one another. By acting on the skeleton, muscles facilitate motion at well lubricated joints, ensuring efficient locomotion. Joints are essential structures within the human skeleton, serving as connection points between bones that often enable movement and flexibility, making them vital to both stability and mobility. They are lubricated by synovial fluid and cushioned by articular cartilage, a type of hyaline cartilage that covers the ends of bones at synovial joints, reducing friction and absorbing shock to ensure smooth and efficient motion. Joints come in different types, each uniquely structured to facilitate specific motions. Video94.Planes_of_movement.mp4. For example, the shoulder (glenohumeral) joint, a ball-and-socket joint, allows for flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and circumduction, supporting a wide range of motion across the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes. This range makes it essential for movements like raising, rotating, and swinging the arm in various directions. Note: The shoulder joint possesses the largest range of motion of any joint in the human body. Similarly, the hip (coxal) joint, also a ball-and-socket joint, provides flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and circumduction across these planes, enabling movements such as sitting, standing, and rotating the leg. The elbow (humeroulnar) joint, in contrast, is a hinge joint that primarily permits flexion and extension in the sagittal plane, allowing controlled bending and straightening of the arm. The knee (tibiofemoral) joint, another hinge joint, limits movement to flexion and extension in the sagittal plane, critical for walking and standing. The ankle (talocrural) joint facilitates plantar flexion and dorsiflexion in the sagittal plane, essential for activities like walking and running. The neck, specifically at the joint between the first two cervical vertebrae (C1 and C2), forms a pivot joint, allowing for flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes, enabling side-to-side and up-and-down head movements. The spine (vertebral column), made of multiple articulating joints, also supports flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation in all three planes, contributing to overall trunk mobility and stability. Gliding (plane or planar) joints, such as those in the wrists (between carpal bones), ankles (between tarsal bones), and vertebrae, allow small sliding movements, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction in the sagittal and frontal planes, contributing to flexibility and balance. Condyloid (condylar or ellipsoidal) joints, such as those in the wrist and fingers, permit flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction in the sagittal and frontal planes but not rotation, facilitating precise tasks like gripping. Saddle joints, like the one at the base of the thumb (carpometacarpal joint), enable unique movements, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction, allowing the thumb to move toward and away from the palm, vital for gripping and grasping. Lastly, the jaw (temporomandibular joint) combines hinge and gliding actions, enabling elevation, depression, protraction, retraction, and lateral excursion in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes, essential for chewing and speaking. Each joint type contributes uniquely to how muscles and bones interact to produce movement: muscles contract and pull bones across joints, translating muscle action into movement. Joints are therefore fundamental in enabling purposeful motion, and they also absorb impact, reducing stress on bones and soft tissues. Conditions affecting joints, like arthritis or injuries, can restrict this mobility and highlight the joint's role in movement and overall physical function. Proper joint care, including regular movement and exercises that promote flexibility and strength, is key to maintaining their functionality, especially since joint issues can lead to complications such as muscle cramps, which may restrict joint mobility temporarily and impact daily activities. Thus, joints are integral to both the supportive and dynamic capabilities of the skeleton, facilitating a complex range of movements while supporting structural stability. However, not all joints allow for movement; some, like sutures in the skull and the gomphoses that anchor teeth to their sockets, are classified as immovable joints (synarthroses). These fixed joints provide stability and protect vital structures, illustrating the diversity of joint types and their roles in the skeletal system. Video95.Joints.mp4. • You can use mind mapping or word processing software to categorise the different types of joints in a human body. • Project: In pairs, research on the structure of any flexible joint. Develop a model or draw an annotated diagram to explain its structure and function. Video91.Joint_movements.mp4. Although the muscles are numerous and complex, they can be classified into two main categories based on their control: involuntary and voluntary muscles. Involuntary muscles operate without conscious control and include cardiac muscles, which are found in the heart and contract rhythmically to pump blood, and smooth muscles, which are located in the walls of organs such as the intestines and blood vessels, facilitating involuntary movements. In contrast, voluntary muscles, primarily skeletal muscles, are under conscious control and are responsible for movements that require intentional effort, such as walking, lifting, and other physical activities. Skeletal muscles can be further classified by the actions they perform when they contract. They include flexors (which bend joints), extensors (which straighten joints), protractors (which move a part forward), retractors (which move a part backward), adductors (which move a part toward the midline), abductors (which move a part away from the midline), rotators (medial and lateral, which turn a part around its axis), levators (which raise a part), depressors (which lower a part), constrictors or sphincters (which close openings), and dilators (which open openings). Often working in pairs known as antagonistic muscles, skeletal muscles enable precise and coordinated movements. In practice, a contracting muscle's antagonist maintains sufficient tension to provide a firm base for movement, which is crucial for controlling movement and maintaining posture. For example, when standing still, postural muscles exhibit slight contraction, known as muscle tone, which stabilises the body in a fixed position. The different muscles are supplied by axons from the limb nerve, the brachial nerve in the case of the forelimb, sciatic nerve in the case of the hind limb. By channelling impulses down the appropriate axons, the central nervous system ensures that each set of muscles contracts at the right time. In vertebrates, muscles act on the skeleton by contracting and relaxing in a coordinated manner, often functioning in pairs known as antagonistic muscles. The movement of the forelimb or arm exemplifies this coordination, involving the biceps and triceps muscles along with those responsible for forearm rotation. The pronator muscles, such as the pronator teres and pronator quadratus, facilitate pronation (rotating the forearm to turn the palm downward), while the biceps brachii, which inserts at the radius, contracts to enable supination (turning the palm upward) and flexion of the arm at the elbow by pulling on the radius. During this action, the triceps, which inserts at the ulna, relaxes, allowing the biceps to function effectively. Note: In anatomy, the insertion of a muscle refers to the point where the muscle attaches to a bone that is moved during contraction, typically located on the distal end of the muscle, allowing for movement of the associated joint as the muscle shortens and pulls on the bone. Conversely, when the triceps brachii contracts to extend the arm at the elbow, it pulls on the ulna, resulting in the straightening of the arm. In this case, the biceps brachii relaxes, allowing the triceps to function effectively. These movements are regulated by the nervous system through reciprocal innervation, ensuring that as one muscle contracts, its opposing muscle relaxes, enabling smooth, precise lifting, lowering, and rotational movements of the forearm. Figure293.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_008.jpg. Figure294.3.7.locomotion_in_mammals_image_009.jpg. However, conditions like tetanus can disrupt the coordinated action of muscles on the skeleton. Tetanus, caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, produces a neurotoxin called tetanospasmin and is typically spread through contaminated wounds, particularly deep puncture wounds from objects like nails or animal bites, where the anaerobic environment allows the bacteria to thrive. Once in the body, the toxin blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, preventing the relaxation of muscles. As a result, motor neurons remain constantly excited, leading to prolonged muscle contractions, or spastic paralysis. Such contractions severely impair normal skeletal movements, causing symptoms like "lockjaw" and rigid spasms, which can be life-threatening if untreated. There is no cure for tetanus once it has developed, making it essential to immunise children against this potentially fatal condition to ensure their normal muscular and skeletal function. The tetanus vaccine is safe and effective, but immunity decreases over time, so booster doses are needed. In summary, the action of muscles on the skeleton, through coordinated contractions and reciprocal innervation, enables efficient movement and stability in animals. The adaptation of skeletal muscles and bones in tetrapods is essential for locomotion, whether it’s moving on land, in water, or in air. The interaction between muscles and bones ensures that animals can perform tasks such as walking, running, or standing with minimal energy expenditure and maximum stability. However, it is important to note that certain processes, such as the movement of sperm via flagella, the action of hair-like cilia in the airways, and the motility of specific white blood cells, operate independently of the muscular system. Video92.How_the_human_muscular_system_works.mp4. • Working in pairs, use your bodies to identify movable parts and the plan in which the movement occurs at each joint. Produce a table naming the joints and the type of movement that occurs at each. • In pairs, observe each other moving the forearm up and down (bending the arm at the elbow). Identify the set of muscles that bring about each movement and research on the name of the muscles responsible for lifting and for extending the arm. Produce an annotated diagram explaining your conclusions. [Assignment 4] {Explore the causes, effects and preventive measures of muscle cramps}. Muscle cramps are sudden, painful contractions of a muscle or muscle group that often occur unexpectedly, typically lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. These cramps commonly affect the muscles of the calves (the muscles at the back of the lower leg), thighs, and feet, and can arise during physical activity, at rest, or even during sleep. Causes of muscle cramps include dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (especially low levels of potassium, calcium, and magnesium), overuse of muscles, and poor blood circulation. Conditions such as nerve compression, insufficient blood flow to the muscles, and underlying health issues like diabetes and thyroid disorders can also trigger cramps. Additionally, certain medications, particularly diuretics and statins, may increase the risk of experiencing these painful contractions. Athletes, people who engage in strenuous exercise, and individuals who sit or stand in one position for extended periods are more prone to cramps. The effects of muscle cramps can range from mild discomfort to intense, sharp pain, which may immobilise the affected muscle temporarily. Persistent or frequent cramps can interrupt physical activities and lead to prolonged muscle soreness. In severe cases, recurrent cramps may indicate an underlying health issue, such as electrolyte imbalances or circulatory problems, that requires medical attention. To prevent muscle cramps, it is crucial to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced intake of essential electrolytes through foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, such as bananas, nuts, and dairy products. Regular stretching and warm-up exercises before intense activity can help maintain muscle flexibility and reduce cramping risk. Additionally, taking breaks during prolonged physical activity or when sitting for extended periods can improve circulation and prevent muscle strain. It is advisable to avoid exercising immediately after eating, as this can increase the risk of muscle cramps due to blood being directed to the digestive system, which reduces the blood available to the muscles. Wearing properly fitting footwear can support foot and leg muscles, further reducing the risk of cramps. For individuals with frequent cramps, consulting a healthcare provider can help identify any underlying causes and establish targeted prevention strategies. Video93.Muscle_cramps.mp4. • In pairs, share experience of and research on the causes and effects of cramps and how to avoid them. Produce a short advisory leaflet;
