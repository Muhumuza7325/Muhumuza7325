Wildlife conservation • In pairs, with the word “wildlife” on the chalkboard, decide on a definition of the word. Then tell the class your definition. • In pairs, discuss why wildlife in East Africa is rapidly being destroyed (population increase, clearing for farming, poaching). • Contribute your ideas to a whole-class discussion. • What might be the consequences of failing to conserve wildlife? • Recognise some threats to wildlife and suggest ways to conserve wild life in East Africa. • In pairs, with the word “tourist” on the chalk board, decide on a definition of the word. Then tell the class your definition. • Guide in a discussion about the connection between wildlife and tourists. • Use photographs to identify important tourist attractions and draw a map to show the main national parks and other tourist areas in East Africa. Why do tourists come? • Working in small groups, discuss the following: • Are all people who come to East Africa, tourists? • What other kinds of people come to East Africa? (Tourists come for pleasure only; Others come on business). • Where would you like to go if you had the money to become a tourist. • Do tourists come to East Africa to see the kinds of things you want to see? Why not? • Explain that tourists mainly come from industrialized countries where they may live in big polluted cities, so they like to see natural areas and wild life. East African tourists might like to see big cities because they live in rural areas. • use Internet to find tourist attractions in East Africa. • make sketch or digital maps to show the location of key features that might attract tourists to East Africa and select one attraction to create a sketch map suitable for a tourist brochure. Discuss which features might be the most important and why. • Use photos of tourist attractions and tourist activities. (National/Game parks, game/wildlife reserves, wild animals, beaches and sea etc.,). • suggest other kinds of areas which attract tourists (historic and pre-historic sites; religious places etc.,). Identify jobs associated with tourism and write a job description for one. Identify and discuss pros and cons of tourism and draw a diagram to show how different groups of people benefit from tourism. Tourism in the local area. Individually think of an area you know e.g., the area round your school or your home area and investigate through fieldwork: what things in the area are or might be good for tourists; What activities might tourists be encouraged to do; How the people of the area could encourage tourists to come. • Use your findings to plan a day’s activity as though you were a tourist guide. • Work in pairs and role-play one being a tourist, and the other persuading them to go on the day activity they have designed. Then swap roles. Where do tourists come from? • Use internet to find statistics of tourist arrivals and origins of tourists in East Africa • Explore statistics of tourist arrivals and origins of tourists for one or all East African countries. draw graphs and analyse them to show tourist arrivals and origins. You could map the statistics if relevant software is available. • Explain that most tourists to East Africa come from industrialized countries, especially Europe which is traditionally linked to East Africa and is close. Also, North America and increasingly China, Japan and South Korea as those countries become more industrialized and richer. Why is East Africa popular for tourists? • Use a wall map of East Africa and ask to list main areas tourists go to. Ask why East Africa is popular for tourists. • Explain that East Africa has some of the best game/national parks and wild life/game reserves, coastlines, mountain scenery and rivers and lakes in Africa • What else attracts tourists? Well-developed facilities: hotels, lodges, roads, tourist transport companies and sports grounds. What are the challenges facing tourism? • In groups, discuss why sometimes tourists do not come to some parts of East Africa and the dangers which may spoil tourism. • Ask why tourists no longer go to some parts of the Kenya coast e.g., north of Masindi (political instability e.g., Al Shabab: rumours of political trouble e.g., during elections or between different ethnic groups/tribes).
