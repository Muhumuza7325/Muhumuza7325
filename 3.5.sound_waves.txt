Theme ***Waves*** "@OMD". TOPIC 5 ***SOUND WAVES*** "14 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to describe the nature of sound waves and how they are transmitted by vibrations in a medium. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; understand that sound is an example of a wave form that requires a medium through which to travel, and determine its velocity in air by the echo method (k, s). • In pairs, plan, carry out and report on investigations, using tuning forks to: • show how sound is produced as a form of energy, making observations relating to vibrations, loudness, and pitch • explore the transmission of sound through air, water and different solids, explaining transmission in terms of density and particle theory. • In groups, plan, carry out and report on investigations to find the velocity of sound in air over 50+ metres, using the echo method, and explain the reasons for the outcomes. Note: The concept of resonance and vibrations in strings and pipes should be left out.
