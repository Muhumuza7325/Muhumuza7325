[Group Work 1] {Explain in detail, the differences between endothermic and exothermic reactions and detail the importance of these reactions in our everyday lives}. All matter possess energy in one form or another. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but only transformed from one form to another. Some substances have energy due to movement of the particles and this is referred to as kinetic energy. The energy that a substance possesses due to its position or due to the arrangement of its component parts is referred to as potential energy. Energy is the capacity of overcoming resistance or doing work. It is a property of matter; it can do work and can be obtained from work. Due to the fact that energy can be present in many forms, it is difficult to determine the magnitude of the total energy possessed by a substance, it is easier to determine the energy changes which take place when the substance interacts with other substances. Chemical changes are normally accompanied by energy changes that can be recognized in many different forms such as: Light e.g., when magnesium burns in air, Sound e.g., explosion of hydrogen and oxygen, Electricity e.g., in a cell reaction (electrochemical cells) and Heat e.g., burning of fuel like charcoal and wood. During metabolism, the chemical energy of food such as carbohydrates is converted to heat energy to keep the body warm, to mechanical energy in muscles and to electrical energy in the impulses within our nerve fibers. In some cases, a reaction may involve a mixture of several energy forms, for example the reactions of potassium with water. The most common form of energy change in chemical reactions is the heat change (enthalpy change). Thermochemistry is the study of heat changes that take place during a chemical reaction. There are basically two types of heat or enthalpy changes (endothermic and exothermic reactions). When a substance gains heat, its temperature rises and when it loses heat, its temperature drops. The prefix 'exo' means 'out' while 'endo' means in. 1) Endothermic reactions. These are reactions during which heat is absorbed from the surroundings and this is detected as a drop in temperature (the temperature of the surroundings decreases). Solution turns cold (the heat in your hands is absorbed, so you feel the test tube becoming cold). The temperature of the products falls below the initial temperature but with time it drops to room temperature as heat is absorbed from the surroundings. At the end of the reaction, the heat content of the products is less than that of the reactants. Thus, in such reactions, the products are at a higher energy level than the reactants and the enthalpy change is positive. Examples of endothermic reactions. Dissolving ammonium nitrate in water, dissolving sodium thiosulphate in water, evaporation, melting, photosynthesis, thermal decomposition. Note that the spraying of deep freeze sprays on football players or them being massaged with ice packs after sustaining injuries, utilises an endothermic reaction. 2) Exothermic reactions. These are reactions during which heat is liberated to the surroundings and this is detected as a rise in temperature (the temperature of the surroundings increases). The solution or test tube becomes hot. The temperature of the products rises above room temperature but with time it drops to room temperature as heat is lost to the surroundings. At the end of the reaction, the heat content of the products is less than that of the reactants. Thus, in such reactions, the products are at a lower energy level than the reactants and the enthalpy change is negative (-∆H). Examples of exothermic reactions. Adding concentrated sulphuric acid to little water in a test tube, reacting dilute sulphuric acid with magnesium ribbon, reacting sodium hydroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid, Burning magnesium in air, condensation, freezing, neutralization reactions, combustion of fuels and respiration. Most reactions are exothermic. ENdothermic reaction means heat or energy ENTER (absorbed/gained) to break bond(s)! EXothermic means heat or energy EXIT (given out/lose) to form bond(s)! Energy flow in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is a community of living organisms, along with their physical environment, interacting as a system. Picture it as a bustling community, from the tiniest microbes to the mightiest predators, all seamlessly intertwined with their surroundings in a finely tuned dance of life. The flow of energy is unidirectional in nature, propelling life forward in a continuous cycle of growth, consumption, and renewal. At the heart of this intricate web lies the sun, radiating energy that kickstarts the entire system. Through the magic of photosynthesis—an endothermic reaction—plants and algae harness this solar power, converting it into the life-sustaining fuel of carbohydrates. From there, the energy journey begins. Herbivores munch on these green wonders, passing on the energy as they become prey to carnivores. Each step up the food chain, energy is transferred, sustaining the diverse array of creatures populating the ecosystem. Yet, at every transfer, a bit of energy dissipates as heat, nature's tax on efficiency, a consequence of the exothermic reactions that fuel life's processes such as respiration. But the cycle doesn't end there. Decomposers step onto the stage, breaking down the remains of the fallen into simpler forms, releasing trapped energy and essential nutrients back into the environment. These nutrients then fuel the growth of new life, closing the loop of the energy cycle. This dynamic flow of energy isn't just about survival; it's about balance. It fuels growth, reproduction, and movement while simultaneously driving the intricate processes that maintain the ecosystem's equilibrium. It is in this delicate dance of energy exchange, that life thrives, and nature finds its harmony. • In groups, research, discuss and report on: • examples of important everyday reactions (such as fermentation, respiration, cooking, burning, etc.,) in which energy is either absorbed or released; • investigations of endothermic or exothermic reactions using the scientific method of dissolving substances (e.g., sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium nitrate, etc.,) in water and noting the temperature changes in each case as the energy stored in bonds is released; • the energy transformations in burning ethanol, paraffin or wood and the change from chemical energy to heat and light. • Individually, research the flow of energy through an ecosystem in which reactions are endothermic (e.g., photosynthesis) and exothermic (e.g., respiration) and produce a chart to explain energy flow and loss; Enthalpy. The amount of energy or heat content of a system is called the enthalpy. It is denoted by the symbol H. Since it is not easy to precisely determine H, we normally consider the enthalpy change of the system (the heat evolved or absorbed), indicated as ∆H, where ∆ = Change of. For an exothermic reaction, the total energy of the reactants is greater than the total energy of the products. For an endothermic reaction, the total energy of the products is greater than the total energy of the reactants. The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction can be calculated as follows: ∆H (read as Delta H) = Total energy of products - Total energy of reactants. Heat energy is measured in kilojoules (KJ). The heat change in a chemical reaction (∆H) is expressed as a negative value if heat is evolved. The SI unit for heat changes is KJmol⁻¹. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) ΔH = -394KJ/mol. This means that when 1 mole of carbon in solid state is completely burnt in gaseous oxygen, it forms 1 mole of gaseous carbon dioxide with evolution of 394KJ of energy. (394KJ are evolved when 12g of carbon combines with 32g of oxygen). C(s) + 2S(s) → CS₂(l) ΔH = +106KJ/mol. This means that when 1 mole of carbon reacts with 2 moles of sulphur, it forms I mole of carbon disulphide with absorption of 106KJ of energy. (106KJ are absorbed when 12g of carbon combines with 64g of sulphur). Bond Making and Bond Breaking. The source of heat change in a chemical reaction is the potential energy which substances possess. Energy is released when bonds, electrovalent, covalent etc., are made and energy is absorbed when bonds are broken, i.e., bond making is an exothermic process since it liberates heat to the surrounding while bond breaking is an endothermic process since it requires heat to the surrounding. Energy is taken in to break bonds and energy is given out for bond forming. The enthalpy changes of a reaction can be calculated by taking the difference between the energy required for bond breaking and the energy required for bond making. ∆H = Total energy absorbed for bond breaking – Total energy released for bond making. Since ∆H < 0 for an exothermic reaction, the energy released for bond making is greater than the energy absorbed for bond breaking. For an endothermic reaction where ∆H > 0, the energy absorbed for bond breaking is greater than the energy released for bond making. Activation Energy. Reactant particles must overcome an energy barrier before they can form products. They must possess a minimum amount of energy for this to occur. The minimum energy required for reactants to form products is the activation energy. Particles that have energy that is equal to or greater than the activation energy will be able to react. Energy Level Diagram. An energy level diagram shows both the enthalpy change and activation energy of a reaction. For an exothermic reaction, the total energy of the reactants is higher than the total energy of the products. The activation energy needed is low. Figure323.4.4.energy_changes_during_chemical_reactions_image_001.jpg. For an endothermic reaction, the total energy of the products is higher than the total energy of the products. The activation energy needed is high. Figure324.4.4.energy_changes_during_chemical_reactions_image_002.jpg. Fuels. Fuels are substances that are burned to release energy. Fossil fuels are commonly used and they undergo complete combustion with excess oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. Apart from combustion of fossil fuels, fuel cells can also be used to release energy. One such fuel cell is a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. In such a cell, oxygen is reduced at the anode to form hydroxide ions while hydrogen is oxidized to form water. Anode: 2H₂(g) + 4OH⁻(aq) → 4H₂O(l) + 4e⁻. Cathode: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e– → 4OH⁻(aq). Overall: 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l). [Group Work 2] {Explain in detail the heat of reaction and interpret energy profiles of chemical reactions}. Heat of reaction. The heat of reaction for a chemical reaction is the amount of heat evolved or absorbed when molar quantities of substances react together completely. Types of heats of reactions. Heat of combustion. This is the amount of heat liberated when one mole of a substance is completely burnt in oxygen. Most combustion reactions are exothermic. Some substances, however, especially those containing nitrogen or sulphur, can undergo endothermic combustion. Examples; 1) Carbon undergoes complete combustion according to the equation. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) ∆H = -393KJmol⁻¹. Calculate the amount of heat evolved when 20g of carbon is completely burnt. 12g of carbon liberate 393KJ. 20g of carbon liberate ((393x20)/12) = 655KJ. 2) Glucose burns in air according to the equation. C₆H₁₂O₆(s) + 6O₂(g) → 6CO₂(g) + 6H₂O(g) ∆H = -2802KJmol⁻¹. Calculate the amount of heat produced when 45g of glucose is completely burnt in air. Molar mass of C₆H₁₂O₆ = 12x6+1x12+16x6 = 180g. 180g of C₆H₁₂O₆ liberate 2802KJ. 45g of C₆H₁₂O₆ liberate ((2802*45)/180)KJ. = 700.5KJ. Determination of heat of combustion of ethanol. Figure325.4.4.energy_changes_during_chemical_reactions_image_003.jpg. A known mass of water (150cm³) is put in a thin metal can. Initial temperature of water is noted, t₁⁰C. The spirit lamp with a wick inserted in it is filled with some ethanol and weighed. The mass of the lamp and ethanol before burning is noted, m₁g. The lamp is lit and placed under the metal can to shield it from draughts; the whole apparatus is placed in a large tin to prevent heat loss. A wire gauge is not used as it would absorb some of the heat. Using the flame from the burning ethanol, heat the water in the can while stirring the water gently with the thermometer. The metal tin is heated until the highest temperature of the water is reached. This highest temperature of the water is noted, t₂⁰C. A tin can is often preferred because tin is a good conductor of heat and transmits most of the heat directly to the water. The lamp is put out immediately and reweighed with its contents to find the new mass of lamp and ethanol after burning, m₂g. Treatment of results: Mass of ethanol = (m₁-m₂)g, Mass of water = 150g, Temperature rise = (t₂-t₁). Specific heat capacity of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹. Heat gained by water = mass x specific heat capacity x temperature rise = mc∆T = 150 x 4.2 x (t₂-t₁)J. Molar mass of ethanol, C₂H₅OH = 12x2+1x5+16+1 = 46g. (m₁-m₂)g of C₂H₅OH liberate 630(t₂-t₁)J. 46g of C₂H₅OH liberates (630(t₂-t₁) * 46)/(m₁-m₂)J. Note: The heat of combustion in this experiment would be lower than the theoretical value because; Heat is lost to the environment during the experiment. Some heat produced warms the metal can and air but does not pass into the water. Examples; 1) When 0.382g of ethanol was burnt, the heat liberated raised the temperature of 100g of water from 16.5⁰C to 43.5⁰C. Calculate the heat of combustion of ethanol (SHC of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, C = 12, H = 1, O = 16). Heat gained by water = mc∆T = 100x4.2x(43.5-16.5)J = 11340J = 11340/1000J = 11.34KJ. Molar mass of C₂H₅OH = 12x2+1x5+16+1 = 46g. 0.382g of C₂H₅OH liberate 11.34KJ. 46g of C₂H₅OH liberate ((11.34*46)/0.382)KJ = 1365.5KJmol⁻¹. 2.When 0.16g of methanol was burnt, the heat generated raised the temperature of 200g of water from 21⁰C to 25⁰C. Calculate the heat of combustion of methanol (S.h.c of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, C = 12, O = 16, H = 1). Heat gained by water = mc∆T = 200x4.2x(25-21)J = 3360J = 3.36KJmol⁻¹. Molar mass of methanol, CH₃OH = 12+1x3+16+1 = 32g. 0.16g of CH₃OH liberate 3.36KJ. 32g of CH₃OH liberate (3.3*32)/0.16 = 672KJmol⁻¹. Exercise. 1) In an experiment to determine the enthalpy of combustion of propan-1-ol (C₃H₇OH), 0.54 g of propan-1-ol was burnt and the heat evolved caused the temperature of 150cm³ of water to rise by 21.5⁰C. Calculate the value of enthalpy of combustion (Ans = 1505KJmol⁻¹). 2) When 0.4 g of ethanol was burnt, it raised the temperature of 0.1 g of water by 20⁰C. Calculate the enthalpy of combustion by taking into consideration that the specific heat capacity of water is 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹ (Ans = 976.7KJmol⁻¹). 3) The enthalpy for the complete combustion of carbon is -393KJmol⁻¹. a) Write an equation for the complete combustion of carbon. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) ΔH = -393KJ/mol. b) 80kg of charcoal costs shs.4000. Calculate the cost of charcoal required to produce 16375KJ. From the equation 393KJ of heat is liberated by 12g of Carbon 16375KJ of heat is liberated by ((16375*12) ⁄ 393)g of Carbon = 500g or 0.5Kg of Carbon. 80 kg of charcoal (carbon) costs shs.4000. 0.5 kg of charcoal (carbon) costs ((4000*0.5)/80) = shs.25. 4) Use the following specimen results to calculate the heat of combustion of ethanol. Initial mass of ethanol lamp and ethanol before burning = 29.974g. Mass of ethanol lamp and ethanol after burning = 29.592g. Initial temperature of water = 17.7˚C. Final temperature of water = 41.2˚C. Volume of water in can = 100cm³. (Given, density of water = 1g/cm³; specific heat capacity of water = 4.2J/g/K C = 12, H = 1, O = 16) [Ans = -1189KJmol⁻¹]. 5) Ethanol burns in excess air according to the equation. 2CH₃OH(l) + 3O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 4H₂O(g) ΔH = -730KJ/mol. Given that 3.2g of methanol were burnt, determine: i) The amount of heat liberated (32.5KJ). ii) The mass of carbon dioxide produced (4.4g). 6) Methane burns according to the equation below. CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). A litre of methane costs shs.600. Calculate the cost of methane required to produce 1.746 × 103KJ of heat. (1 mole of gas occupies 24 litres at r.t, heat of combustion of methane is -882KJmol⁻¹). Importance of enthalpy of combustion. It helps in nutrition when recommending suitable food stuff for an individual, depending on his or her energy requirements. The enthalpy of combustion is vital when buying fuel, since the different types of fuel differ in their energy values. • In groups, design and carry out an investigation to compare the heat given out when different fuels burn (e.g., peanuts, oils, paper, and wood). Heat of solution. Enthalpy of solution is the amount of heat evolved or absorbed when one mole of a substance is completely dissolved in water so that further dissolution causes no further temperature changes. Or; This is the heat change which occurs when one mole of a solute is dissolved in a specified amount of solvent to form an infinitely dilute solution. An infinitely dilute solution is one in which further dilution does not show any heat change. Note: Enthalpy of solution can be either endothermic or exothermic. If it is exothermic, it means that the solute is not very soluble in water and would easily dissolve on heating. If it is endothermic, the solute is said to be very soluble in water e.g., sodium hydroxide, gases such as sulphur dioxide, and anhydrous copper (II) sulphate. Determination of heat of solution of Ammonium nitrate. A known volume of water (100cm³) is placed in a beaker / calorimeter and its initial temperature noted. A known mass of ammonium nitrate (4.0g) is carefully added to the water in the beaker / calorimeter with constant stirring. Stir the mixture well with a stirrer until there is no change in temperature and record the highest or lowest temperature of the solution reached. Typical results. Initial temperature of water = 18.5⁰C, Final temperature of water = 16.0⁰C, Temperature fall = 2.5⁰C, Mass of ammonium nitrate = 4.0g, Mass of water = 100g, Specific capacity of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹) Heat absorbed = mc∆T = 1050J = 1.05KJ. Molar mass of ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ = 14+1x4+14+16x3 = 80g. 4.0g of NH₄NO₃ liberate 1.05KJ. 80g of NH₄NO₃ liberate (1.05/4.0*80)KJmol⁻¹ = +21.0KJmol⁻¹. Example; 0.5g of ammonium nitrate was dissolved in 50cm³ of water. The temperature dropped from 24⁰C to18⁰C. Calculate the enthalpy of solution of ammonium nitrate (specific heat capacity of water = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of water = 1gcm⁻³, N = 14, H = 1, O = 16). Heat absorbed = mc∆T = 50x4.2x(24-18) = 1260J = 1.26KJ. Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+1x4+14+16x3 = 80g. 0.5g of NH₄NO₃ liberate 1.26KJ. 80g of NH₄NO₃ liberate 1.2/0.5*80KJ = 201.6KJmol⁻¹. Exercise. 1) 1 g of sodium chloride was added to 1000cm³ of water in a calorimeter. The temperature of water changed from 23⁰C to 27⁰C. Calculate the heat of solution of sodium chloride (shc is 4.2J/g/K and density is 1g/cc) [Ans = 99.8118KJ/mol]. 2) When 10g of ammonium chloride was dissolved in 100cm³ of water, the temperature changed from 21⁰C to 19˚C. Determine the molar heat of solution of ammonium chloride (shc of solution = 4.2J/g/˚C, density of water = 1g/cm³, N = 14, H = 1, Cl = 35.5). [Ans = 4.9434KJ/mol]. 3) When 16g of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate were dissolved in 150cm³ of water, the temperature changed from 24˚C to 29˚C. Determine the heat of solution of the anhydrous copper (II) sulphate [Ans = 34.860KJ/mol] and with a reason, state whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. Heat of neutralization. This is the amount of heat evolved when one mole of aqueous hydrogen ions reacts with one mole of aqueous hydroxide ions / hydroxyl ion to form one mole of water. H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l). The heat of neutralization depends on the nature of the acid and the base reacted i.e. The enthalpy change associated with the neutralization of strong acids by strong bases typically remains relatively constant at around -57.3 kJ/mol. While there might be slight variations depending on the specific acid and base or experimental conditions, this value serves as a consistent benchmark for such reactions. This is because strong acids and bases and the salt produced are completely ionized giving many free hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions which readily combine giving a lot of heat. There is no heat required for bond breaking as the ions are already existing freely. For strong acid/weak base or weak acid/strong base or weak acid/weak base, the heat released is small (less than 57.3KJmol⁻¹) and inconsistent. This is because weak acids and bases are partially ionized giving few hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions and some heat which should have been released is used to completely ionize the weak acid and base instead, for neutralization to occur Determination of heat of neutralization between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. A fixed volume, V₁ = 100cm³ of a known molarity, m₁ of hydrochloric acid (2M HCl) is measured into a plastic beaker / vacuum flask / a calorimeter and the initial temperature of the acid, T₁ is noted. Similarly, a fixed volume, V₂ = 100cm³ of a known molarity, m₂ of sodium hydroxide (2M NaOH) is measured and the initial temperature of the alkali, T₂ is noted. NaOH is carefully added into the beaker / vacuum flask / calorimeter containing HCl, stirring gently with a stirrer. The highest temperature of the mixture, T₂ is noted. Treatment of results. Initial temperature of hydrochloric acid = 21.0⁰C. Initial temperature of sodium hydroxide = 22.0⁰C. Average temperature of solutions = 21.5⁰C. Final temperature of the mixture = 34.5⁰C. Specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹) Heat evolved = mc∆T = 200x4.2x(34.5-21.5)J = 10920J = 10.92KJ. Moles of HCl or NaOH = 2/1000*100 = 0.2moles. 0.2moles of HCl liberate 10.92KJ. 1mole of HCl liberates 10.92/0.2 = 54.6KJmol⁻¹ ∴ The heat of neutralization of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide = 54.6KJmol⁻¹. Examples; 1) 1.50cm³ of 2M hydrochloric acid reacts with 50cm³of 2M sodium hydroxide, both at 22⁰C in a plastic beaker. The mixture was stirred and its maximum temperature was 35⁰C (specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³). Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization of sodium hydroxide. Heat gained by the solution = mc∆T = 100x4.2x(35-22)J = 5460J = 5.46KJ. Moles of NaOH = 2/1000*50 = 0.1moles. 0.1moles of NaOH liberate 5.46KJ. 1mole of NaOH liberates = 54.6KJmol⁻¹. 2) When 50.0cm³ of 1.0M sulphuric acid was added to 50.0cm³ of 2M sodium hydroxide, the temperature of the resultant mixture rose by 13.6⁰C (specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³). Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization of sodium hydroxide. Heat gained by the solution = mc∆T = 100x4.2x13.6J = 5712J = 5.712KJ. Moles of NaOH = 2/1000*50 = 0.1moles. 0.1moles of NaOH liberate 5.712KJ. 1mole of NaOH liberates 5.712/0.1 = 57.12KJmol⁻¹. Exercise. 1) When 50cm³ of 0.5M hydrochloric acid was added to 50cm³ of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide in a calorimeter. There was a temperature rise from 27.5 to 30.8℃. Calculate the heat of neutralization (Ans = 55.44). 2) 50cm³ of sodium hydroxide of concentration 0.4M required 20cm³ of 0.5 M sulphuric acid for complete neutralization. The temperature rise was 3.4℃. If both solutions in the calorimeter were initially at the same temperature. Find the enthalpy of neutralization of the reaction. (Assume the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible and s.h.c of water is 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹) [Ans = 62.475]. 3) 50cm³ of 2M HCl and 50cm³ of 2M NaOH both at 22˚C where mixed in a plastic beaker. The mixture was stirred and the maximum temperature contained was 35˚C (SHC of solution = 4.2J/g/˚C Density of solution = 1g/cm³). a) Write the ionic equation for the reaction. b) Calculate the heat change for the reaction [5460J]. c) Calculate the heat change when 1 mole of the acid is neutralized by 1 mole of the base i.e., molar enthalpy of neutralization [546KJ]. d) In another experiment, 50cm³ of 2M NH₄OH was used instead of the NaOH. State whether the heat of reaction was greater than, equal to or less than the value you calculated [Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base and not completely ionized, its heat of neutralization was less than the calculated value]. 4) When 50cm³ of 0.5M HCl acid solution was added to 50cm³ of 0.5M KOH solution in a calorimeter, there was a temperature rise from 27.5˚C to 30.8˚C. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization of the reaction. (density of water = 1g/cm³ and its heat capacity is 4.2J/g/˚C). 5) Use the following results to calculate the heat of neutralization of an acid. (Assume density of solution = 1g/cm³). Volume of 2M NaOH = 20cm³. Volume of 2M HCl = 20cm³. Initial temperature of HCl = 14.0˚C Initial temperature of NaOH = 14.4˚C. Final temperature of the mixture = 27.2˚C. (Answer = 54.6KJ/mol). Heat of Displacement. This is the amount of heat absorbed or evolved when one mole of a substance is displaced from its compound by another substance higher than it in the electrochemical series. These reactions are normally occupied by colour changes. Determination of heat of displacement of copper. Measure 50cm³ of 0.2M copper (II) sulphate solution into a plastic bottle fitted with a bung carrying a thermometer. Stir and record the initial temperature of the solution. Weigh 1g of iron filings, add the filings to the solution and stir well using a thermometer (crucial for accurately determining the highest temperature attained by the solution). Record the highest temperature attained by the solution. Results and calculations. Initial temperature of CuSO₄ = 21.0⁰C, Final temperature = 27.0⁰C, Rise in temperature = 6.0⁰C, Mass of 50cm³ of CuSO₄ solution = 50g. Specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹. Heat change = mc∆T = 50x4.2x6.0J = 1260J = 1.26KJ. Moles of CuSO₄ = 0.2/1000*50 = 0.01moles. 0.01moles of CuSO₄ liberate 1.26KJ. 1mole of CuSO₄ liberates = -126KJmol⁻¹. The thermochemical equation for the reaction is: CuSO₄(aq) + Fe(s) → Cu(s) + FeSO₄(aq) ∆H = -126KJmol⁻¹. b) A known volume of copper (II) sulphate solution of known molarity is measured into a conical flask and its initial temperature is taken. The solution is put in a calorimeter and a known mass of zinc dust is added to the copper (II) sulphate solution with constant stirring until there is a reasonable change in the heat content of the mixture. The highest temperature attained is recorded. Example: 1(a) When an excess of iron filings was added to 25cm³ of 0.4M copper (II) solution, there was a temperature rise of 15⁰C. Calculate the molar enthalpy of displacement of copper specific heat capacity of solution = 4.2Jg⁻¹K⁻¹, density of solution = 1gcm⁻³. Heat change = mc∆T = 25x4.2x15 = 1575J = 1.575KJ. Moles of CuSO₄ = 0.4/1000*25 = 0.01moles. 0.01moles of CuSO₄ liberate 1.575KJ. 1mole of CuSO₄ liberates 1.575/0.01 = +157.5KJmol⁻¹. (b) Write the thermochemical equation for the reaction. CuSO₄(aq) + Fe(s) → Cu(s) + FeSO₄(aq) ∆H = +157.5KJmol⁻¹. 2) To 100cm³ of 0.2M copper (II) sulphate solution in a plastic beaker was added excess zinc dust. There was a temperature change from 20⁰C to 30.4⁰C. Why was a plastic beaker used? The plastic beaker is a poor conductor of heat and minimizes heat loss to the surrounding.

Heat of formation. The heat of formation, also known as the standard enthalpy of formation, is the change in enthalpy that occurs when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states at a specified temperature (usually 25°C or 298K) and pressure (usually 1atm). The standard state of an element is its most stable form at the specified temperature and pressure. For example: H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) → H₂O(l) ΔH Formation = -286KJ/mol. 286JK of heat is evolved when one mole of water is formed from I mole of gaseous hydrogen and ½ a mole of gaseous oxygen.

When a solid is heated, its particles absorb energy, leading to an increase in their kinetic energy. Initially, these particles are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement and vibrate in place. As the solid absorbs heat, the particles vibrate more vigorously, eventually gaining sufficient energy to break the intermolecular forces holding them in position within the solid lattice. Upon reaching the melting point, the solid transitions into a liquid state. This transition requires an input of energy to overcome the cohesive forces between particles, facilitating their movement past one another. However, during this phase transition, the temperature remains constant despite the continued addition of heat energy. This is because the energy absorbed is utilized to disrupt the intermolecular bonds rather than raising the temperature of the substance. The energy absorbed during the melting process is known as latent heat. "Latent" denotes that this energy is concealed within the substance's internal structure and does not manifest as an increase in temperature. Once all the solid has melted, further heating will cause the temperature of the liquid to rise. Melting represents an endothermic process as it necessitates the absorption of heat energy. The enthalpy of melting, or fusion, signifies the energy absorbed per mole when a substance transitions from a solid to a liquid state. Conversely, freezing corresponds to an exothermic process, releasing heat energy as the substance shifts from a liquid to a solid state. The enthalpy of freezing denotes the energy liberated per mole during this transition. Enthalpy changes associated with melting and freezing are typically determined under standard conditions of 1 atmosphere pressure and at the specific temperature at which the phase transition occurs. This standardization enables consistent comparisons between substances. A crucial relationship exists between the enthalpies of melting and freezing: the enthalpy of freezing equals the negation of the enthalpy of melting. Symbolically: ΔH freezing = -ΔH melting. ​This relationship underscores that the energy absorbed during melting precisely balances the energy released during freezing, assuming the transitions occur at identical temperatures and pressures. Note: For both Freezing & Melting, temperature remains constant during the process! Vaporization. Vaporization occurs when a liquid transitions into a gas phase. In the liquid phase, particles are in constant motion, and intermolecular forces persist, holding the particles together. Heating a liquid elevates the average kinetic energy of its molecules. Consequently, some molecules, possessing energy levels exceeding the average, can overcome the attractive forces of neighboring molecules and enter the vapor phase. Vaporization, thus, is classified as an endothermic process. The enthalpy of vaporization represents the energy change occurring when one mole of a substance undergoes a state change from liquid to vapor. ΔH vaporization = Enthalpy of vapor - Enthalpy of liquid. Condensation is the reverse of vaporization and it is exothermic. ΔH condensation = -ΔH vaporization. • In groups, research on heat of reaction, and interpret energy profiles, create a presentation to explain energy profile diagrams for exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions;
