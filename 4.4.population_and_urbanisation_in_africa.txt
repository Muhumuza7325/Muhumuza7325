POPULATION AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. TOPICS: 28 – 29: 36 PERIODS. Theme ***Population and urban development in Africa and Other parts of the world*** "@OMD". TOPIC 28 ***POPULATION AND URBANISATION IN AFRICA*** "22 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the growth rates and distribution of population in Africa, reasons for rapid urbanisation and its consequences. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the concepts related to population (u); b) understand the relationship between population, resources and the provision of services (u); c) understand the demographic transition model and how this relates to the historical growth and population structures of East Africa(u); d) understand the factors which have led to rapid population increase in Uganda and the rest of East Africa e. use maps, statistics, graphs and diagrams to analyse population (s); f) know the areas of high, moderate and low population density in Africa (k); g) locate and name some major urban areas in Africa (k, s); h) understand the distribution of population in Africa and the factors that influence the distribution (u); h) understand why the population of some countries is growing faster than others (u); i) appreciate the advantages and problems of having a large or rapidly increasing population in a country (v, a, gs); k) understand the methods which can be used to control the rate of population growth (u); l) appreciate the need for, and use of population control methods (v, a, gs); m) use statistics and graphs to show rapid urban development (s); n) understand rural-urban migration and the reasons for this type of migration(u); o) understand the rapid growth of urban areas, problems facing urban areas and the effects of urbanisation on the environment (u); p) draw maps to show the main areas of high density of population and main urban areas of Africa (s); q) appreciate the need for planning urban areas and urban growth (v, a, gs); r) understand the relationship between a rapidly growing population and urbanisation (u). Population growth • Revision by questioning: Explain birth and death rates, and how these rates affect population growth. • Using the statistics of Africa’s population about every 10 years from 1900 to date, describe the growth of population over the period. • use the Internet to find the above figures. • suggest reasons for the rapid growth of population in Africa e.g., • high fertility rate • high birth rate • early marriage. Distribution of population • Using a map showing the distribution population in Africa, identify the main areas of high density (over 40 persons per sq.km), moderate density (10 – 40 people per sq.km) and low density (less than 10 persons per sq.km) and suggest reasons for these densities. • work in groups to discuss and list the factors which affect the density of population in Africa. • Explain and expand your views where necessary. Problems caused by rapid population increase • Look up population growth on the Internet. • work in pairs and discuss the problems caused by increasing rate of population growth and high densities of population, drawing on your own experience and previous discussion of Uganda (topic 21). Look at rural and urban areas. Compare views with another pair. • As a whole class, discuss and give opinions on whether African countries should try to reduce the high rate of population growth, giving reasons. • How can the rate of population growth be reduced. Do you agree with the following possible methods: • birth control and family planning • abstinence • education of women • education of men • limiting number of children allowed in a family, as in China Urbanisation in Africa • make a statistical analysis of the population growth in some urban areas. • choose some urban areas/cities in Africa. Look them up on Internet and describe their characteristics. • discuss the causes of rural-urban drift. • discuss and list the problems caused by rapid urban growth: revision of topic 21. • discuss the need for planning urban areas. • look up Lagos on Internet • Carry out a case study of an urban area in Africa: Lagos or similar area, emphasising growing inequality and social problems caused. • discuss how the problems of urban areas can be solved or alleviated;
