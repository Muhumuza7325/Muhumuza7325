Theme ***Introduction to Geography*** "@OMD". TOPIC 3 ***MAPS AND THEIR USES*** "14 PERIODS". Competency; The learner knows the main features of a map and understands the differences between a map and reality. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) draw a sketch map of the school and/or the local area (s); b) use and interpret symbols and identify features on a map using a key (s); c) identify directions on a map, using basic compass points (s); d) follow routes on a map (s); e) draw a map using a simple scale and use scale on a map (s); f) use letter and number co-ordinates or bearings and directions to locate places on a map (s); g) locate places on an atlas map using latitude and longitude and describe the places from information on the map (s); u)derstand the difference between a map and a photograph (u, s); h) understand that there are many types of maps on different scales (u); i) use a linear scale and representative fraction to estimate distance, area and size of features on a map(s). Types of scale • Look at a photograph of a person and compare this with the real size of the person or, if you have a mobile phone, take a ‘selfie’ and ask your neighbour if it is your real size. • if a photograph reduces the real size of a person by a certain amount, does it reduce all parts by the same amount? • Understand that a scale does the same thing on a map or photograph. Explore the concept of the representative fraction scale, e.g., 1:10 • Produce a sketch map of an area showing comparative size, shape and distance. Calculate representative fractions to help you do this. • use paper and digital maps at different scales to measure and compare distances between features of your locality e.g., your home and school, nearest town, river etc. • measure areas, distance and length of features on maps to ask and answer questions about a locale e.g., about patterns of land use. Investigate types of symbols used on a map and devise some of your own. • play games using grid references to find hidden objects out of doors or use these as clues to guess the feature on a map. • use globe-tossing activities to find places, using latitude and longitude clues and then they write your own clues. • develop these skills in meaningful contexts and fieldwork to investigate where places are and what they are like. Directions and compass • On the same map, how do you know which direction to go? • Explain that maps show real directions. • Swap maps and in pairs ask to explain directions between places. • Using a map with compass directions and through asking for directions between places, revise compass from primary school. • draw, the main points of compass. • Explain compass bearings based on degrees of a circle. • do an activity based on compass bearings. Grids • Show a map with grid and explain grid: eastings, northings, four and six-figure grid references. • locate places using a map grid. Types of maps • explain certain places you have seen drawn on maps. • Explain that we can draw any area on a map from the school or district to Uganda, Africa or the whole world. • Show examples of different types of maps: wall maps, atlases, globes (Physical, political, topographic, road/street, climate, thematic) and explain what each map shows and how it differs from other maps;
