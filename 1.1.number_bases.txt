THEME: NUMBERS
TOPIC 1: NUMBER BASES 15 PERIODS
Competency: The learner uses decimal place value to develop understanding of numbers written in other bases.
LEARNING OUTCOMES SUGGESTED LEARNING ACTIVITIES SAMPLE ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
The learner should be able to:
• identify numbers in any base using
abacus. (k)
• Playing number games, for example matching numbers in base two with identify place values of various number
• convert numbers from one base to
another. (u)
numbers in base ten e.g. 1111 base two is
matched to 15 base ten.
• Imagine living in cartoon world where
people have just eight digits rather than ten
– what would their arithmetic be like?
• Design counters in different number
bases using strips threaded through card:
• Prepare strips numbered 0 to 9, thread
through card so a single number on each
number is displayed, use to make different
numbers. Change the length of the strips to
investigate different number bases (e.g. 2222
in base 8).


How
do you find p and q if 10020 base p = 87 base q ?
