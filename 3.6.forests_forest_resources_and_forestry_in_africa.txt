FORESTRY AND IRRIGATION IN AFRICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. TOPICS 23– 24: 36 PERIODS. Theme ***Forestry and irrigation in Africa and other parts of the world*** "@OMD". TOPIC 23 ***FORESTS, FOREST RESOURCES AND FORESTRY IN AFRICA*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the importance and uses of forest resources in Africa and why they should be preserved. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know where the main forest resources in Africa are and their main uses (k); b) draw maps to show the areas of the case studies on forestry and graphs to illustrate their climates (s); c) understand the location and reasons for location of the forest resources in Africa (u); d) know the characteristics of the forests in Africa (K); e) understand the importance of forests in terms of the environment (u); f) understand factors that favour the development of a hardwoods industry (u); g) understand the methods of harvesting trees from the forest (u); h) understand the development of the hardwood trade in Gabon (u); i) recognise from photographs the characteristics of forests and activities related to logging in Gabon (s); j) use simple graphs, charts and diagrams to present and analyse statistics on the timber industry in Gabon (s, gs); k) draw a map showing the major forested areas and timber processing areas in Gabon (s); l) appreciate the dangers of unsustainable forestry in Africa and the dangers of destroying forests (v, a, gs); m) appreciate the dangers of overuse of the natural vegetation (v, gs); n) understand the effects of human activities on the environment (u); o) draw diagrams and flow diagrams to show stages in logging (s); p) appreciate the need to preserve the natural environment (v/a, gs); q) appreciate the dangers of overuse of natural resources: deforestation and over- fishing (v/a, gs). African forests and their importance • brainstorm from previous knowledge where the main forests in Africa are and how these are related to the climate. What type of timber do they produce? draw and use maps to show this information. • Use your maps to explain the location and types of forests in Africa and link these two aspects to climate. • brainstorm from previous knowledge the main characteristics of tropical rain forests. • work in groups to research African forests on Internet and identify a list of benefits they bring to the environment, people and the economy. • In groups, discuss the importance of forests in preserving the environment (preserving, binding and forming soils; absorbing rain fall and giving off water vapour through transpiration, creating rainfall). • use your research and present your data to other groups with explanations. The use of forests in Gabon • Explain that African forests mainly contain hard wood trees, the most valuable timber. • Suggest why the timber industry has developed in Gabon (accessible with flat land, rivers for floating logs, other transport, capital often from overseas, political stability; the most important). • Look at photographs of logging and describe what you see. In pairs, construct a flow diagram to show the production, use and export of timber (show clearing roads/paths, chain saws, tree falling, cutting timber into logs, transport, log collection points, export overseas by barge/ship, local use in timber factory). Exchange your flow diagram with another pair, discuss your ideas and agree on how to improve them. • Why is it better to process the timber and make things in Africa, rather than selling it directly overseas. What can be made? What are the difficulties in processing timber? (furniture industry, building, paper; the main difficulty is inadequate capital). Destruction of forests in Africa • work in groups to research deforestation in Africa using the Internet or textbooks. Use this research and class discussions to assume the role of the Minister responsible for Forests and report back with a policy to control the cutting down of forests. • Have you heard of illegal destruction or cutting down of forests in Uganda? Why is this happening, and what are the trees used for? (Forests cut for timber for sale, for charcoal, and clearing land for farming). • Explain that this is happening in all forested areas of Africa. What are the dangers of cutting down too much forest cover. What are the difficulties of controlling deforestation? • How can this be controlled and how can we replace the forests (e.g., use strict laws, prevent corruption, replant forests, and have laws that one must replace every tree they cut). • Through questioning, assist to explore why re-planting forests only works partially (the planted forest does not contain the same variety of species as the natural forest and hard wood takes a long period of time to grow).
