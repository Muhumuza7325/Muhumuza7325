[Assignment 1] {Explore the role of enzymes in influencing life processes and the factors that affect the working of enzymes (No details of lock and key mechanism required)}. Enzymes are organic compounds, protein in nature, that speed up the rate of biochemical reactions in the body of an organism and remain unchanged at the end of the reaction. They act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy required for reactions to occur. Enzymes remain unchanged at the end of the reaction and are produced by living cells. Their specific structure allows them to interact with particular substrates, facilitating the conversion of these substrates into products. Nomenclature of enzymes. Enzymes are named following several systems, but the simplest rule is to add the suffix "-ase" to the name of the substrate. A substrate is the substance that the enzyme acts upon. For example, enzymes that act on proteins are called proteases, those that act on carbohydrates are generally referred to as carbohydrases, and those that act on maltose are called maltases. However, some enzymes have retained their traditional names, such as ptyalin, rennin, pepsin, and trypsin. It is important to note that the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) has established a more standardised system for naming enzymes. This system uses a four-digit numerical code to classify enzymes based on their reaction type. However, the simpler systems described above are still commonly used. Classification of enzymes. Enzymes are classified based on the type of reactions they catalyse. Isomerases catalyse reactions involving the conversion of molecules into their isomers. Phosphorylases are involved in reactions that add a phosphate group to a molecule. Hydrogenases catalyse the addition of hydrogen atoms, while dehydrogenases are responsible for the removal of hydrogen atoms. Kinases catalyse reactions that involve the transfer of phosphate groups from one molecule to another. Hydrases catalyse the addition of water to a substrate without breaking it down, whereas hydrolases catalyse the addition of water to break down substrates into simpler products. Carboxylases catalyse reactions involving the addition of carbon dioxide. Enzymes can also be classified based on their location of activity. Intracellular enzymes catalyse reactions within the cells that produce them, such as all respiratory enzymes. On the other hand, extracellular enzymes are produced by a cell to catalyse reactions outside of that cell. For example, all digestive enzymes in humans are extracellular. Importance of enzymes. The rate at which some reactions occur in the body without enzymes is too slow to sustain life. Just imagine our bodies without enzymes! How long would the breakdown of food take? Enzymes speed up the rate of a reaction without changing the product formed and the nature of the reaction i.e., an enzyme cannot make a reaction that would not occur to take place and it cannot make an endothermic reaction exothermic but only ensures that products are formed in the shortest time possible. They work by lowering the activation energy, the minimum energy required for the reaction to proceed. This allows substrates to overcome the energy barrier more easily, leading to a faster reaction. By acting like efficient matchmakers, enzymes, just like any other catalysts bring reactants together in a way that facilitates their interaction and speeds up the overall process. Figure447.2.5.nutrition_in_mammals_image_001.jpg. Enzymes are essential for a wide range of biological processes, including metabolism, digestion, cellular processes, and various medical and industrial applications. Enzymes regulate metabolism, breaking down food into energy, building and repairing tissues, and eliminating waste, ensuring the body functions optimally. They also play a crucial role in digestion, breaking down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. Moreover, enzymes are involved in many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, protein synthesis, and energy production. In addition to their biological functions, enzymes have numerous medical and industrial applications. They are used in diagnostic tests to detect diseases, in treatments for certain medical conditions, and in various industrial processes such as food production, detergents, and biofuels. During food processing, manufacturers use enzymes to produce lactose-free products, such as yoghurts, by adding the enzyme lactase to break down lactose into glucose and galactose. This process is beneficial for individuals with lactose intolerance, who cannot digest lactose effectively. Additionally, enzymes can be used to reduce the allergenicity of certain foods. By modifying proteins or other allergens using enzymes, manufacturers can create products that are less likely to trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is particularly important for people with food allergies, as it allows them to enjoy a wider variety of foods. Properties of enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts that significantly speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. This catalytic property allows them to be effective even in small amounts. All enzymes are proteins, and their specific structure determines their function. While many enzymes catalyse reversible reactions, some can only catalyse reactions in one direction. Enzymes are highly specific, often acting on a single type or class of substrate. For example, maltase specifically breaks down maltose. Each enzyme operates best under specific conditions, such as a particular temperature and pH range. For instance, lactase functions optimally at human body temperature (37°C), while pepsin works best in an acidic environment. Enzymes are sensitive to pH and temperature. Changes in pH can alter the enzyme's structure, particularly the shape of its active site, rendering it less effective or completely inactive. Extreme pH levels can lead to the breaking of bonds that maintain the enzyme's three-dimensional structure, resulting in denaturation, where the enzyme loses its specific shape and, consequently, its functionality. Temperatures that are too low can inactivate enzymes, while excessively high temperatures can cause denaturation, leading to loss of structure and function. Enzymes can be activated by certain substances, known as activators, such as chloride ions in the case of amylase. Conversely, they can be inhibited by other substances, known as inhibitors or poisons e.g., cyanide. Mechanism of enzyme action. The widely accepted mechanism by which enzymes are known to work is the “key and lock” hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that the enzyme has a specific region known as the active site where the substrate fits just like a key fitting in a lock. The substrate must have a complementally shape to the active site of the enzyme. In this hypothesis, the key is analogous to the substrate and the lock to the enzyme. When the substrate combines with the enzyme, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. This breaks down to release the products and the enzyme, which can pick other substrates. Figure103.nutrition_in_mammals_image_103.jpg. [Assignment 2] {Conduct experiments on and explain the effects of pH and temperature on enzyme activity}. [Assignment 3] {Understand the effect of pH and temperature on enzyme activity}. Factors affecting enzyme activities. Enzyme activity is influenced by various factors, including temperature, substrate concentration, pH, the presence of activators and inhibitors, and enzyme concentration. To accurately study the effect of one factor, it is essential to maintain all other factors at constant and optimal levels. This ensures that any observed changes in reaction rate are directly attributable to the factor being investigated. a) Concentration of substrate: Substrate concentration significantly affects enzyme activity. As the concentration of the substrate increases, the rate of the enzyme-catalysed reaction generally increases. This is because there are more substrate molecules available to bind to the enzyme's active sites. However, there is a point at which increasing the substrate concentration no longer leads to a significant increase in reaction rate. This occurs when all the enzyme's active sites are fully saturated with substrate molecules. Adding more substrate won't increase the reaction rate because there are no more available sites for the substrate to bind to. In this scenario, enzyme concentration becomes the limiting factor. To further enhance the reaction rate, it's necessary to increase the concentration of the enzyme itself. This will provide more active sites for the substrate to bind to, allowing for a higher overall reaction rate. A graph showing how the rate of reaction varies with substrate concentration. Figure99.nutrition_in_mammals_image_099.jpg. b) Enzyme concentration: As the concentration of the enzyme increases, the rate of the reaction generally increases. This is because there are more enzyme molecules available to bind with the substrate. However, there is a point at which increasing the enzyme concentration no longer leads to a significant increase in reaction rate. This occurs when all the substrate molecules are being acted upon by the available enzymes. At this point, enzyme concentration is no longer the limiting factor, and the reaction rate becomes constant. To further increase the reaction rate, one would need to increase the concentration of the substrate. A graph showing variation of enzyme activity with enzyme concentration. Figure101.nutrition_in_mammals_image_101.jpg. c) The pH of the medium. The pH of the medium significantly affects enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal pH range within which it functions most effectively. Deviations from this optimal pH can disrupt the enzyme's structure and reduce or completely stop its activity. For example, pepsin, an enzyme found in the stomach, operates best in an acidic environment with a pH of 1.5 to 2.5. This acidic environment is necessary for pepsin to break down proteins in the stomach. In contrast, trypsin, an enzyme found in the duodenum, functions optimally in an alkaline pH range of 8.5 to 9.5. This alkaline environment is necessary for trypsin to continue the process of protein digestion in the small intestine. A graph showing variation of different enzyme activity with pH. Figure102.nutrition_in_mammals_image_102.jpg. An experiment to determine the effect of pH on enzyme activity: To investigate the influence of pH on enzyme activity, three test tubes are labelled A, B, and C, each containing 2cm³ of hydrogen peroxide solution. To test tube A is added 1cm³ of sodium hydroxide solution (alkaline pH), to test tube B is added 1cm³ of hydrochloric acid solution (acidic pH), and to test tube C is added 1cm³ of water (neutral pH). A potato cube is added to each test tube, and the rate of effervescence (gas bubble production) is observed. The results indicate that the enzyme in the potato tissue is most active at a neutral pH, as evidenced by the rapid effervescence in test tube C. Test tube A, with an alkaline pH, exhibits slower effervescence, suggesting reduced enzyme activity. In contrast, test tube B, under acidic conditions, shows no effervescence, indicating complete enzyme inactivity. These findings demonstrate that the pH of the medium significantly affects enzyme activity. The control experiment, using water as the pH buffer, helps to establish a baseline for comparison and ensures that any observed changes in effervescence are due to the pH of the medium, rather than other factors. Explanation: The potato extract contains the enzyme catalase, which catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas. The effervescence observed in the test tubes is due to the release of oxygen gas. As an alternative to the potato experiment, amylase activity can be investigated using a similar setup, but with amylase solution, starch solution, and pH buffers (hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, or water) added to test tubes, followed by incubation and the addition of iodine solution to assess starch breakdown. Video25.Potato_Catalase_Enzyme_Experiment.mp4. d) Temperature: Enzymes are highly sensitive to temperature. At very low temperatures, enzymes become inactive, leading to a slow reaction rate. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also increases, resulting in more frequent collisions between the enzyme and substrate, which can enhance the reaction rate. However, there is a specific temperature, known as the optimal temperature, at which the enzyme exhibits maximum activity. Further increases in temperature decreases the rate of reaction exponentially/sharply/steeply since high temperatures can cause the enzyme to denature i.e., the active site of the enzyme is altered (changed) or completely destroyed. This denaturation process is often irreversible, meaning that the enzyme cannot regain its original structure and function once it has been damaged. A graph showing the variation of enzyme activity with temperature. Figure100.nutrition_in_mammals_image_100.jpg. An experiment to determine the effect of temperature on enzyme activity: To investigate the influence of temperature on amylase activity, three test tubes are labelled A, B, and C, each containing 20cm³ of 1% starch solution. Test tube A is placed in an ice bath / ice cubes / very cold water; test tube B in a 35°C water bath; and test tube C in a 60°C water bath. 1cm³ of amylase enzyme is added to all three test tubes, and the setup is incubated for 40 minutes. After incubation, iodine solution is added to each test tube to detect the presence of starch. Observation: In test tube A, starch is present. In test tube B, starch is absent. In test tube C, starch is present. The results show that amylase is most active at 35°C, effectively breaking down starch. At low temperatures (ice bath), the enzyme is inactive, while at high temperatures (60°C), the enzyme is denatured, losing its ability to catalyse the reaction. These findings demonstrate that temperature significantly affects enzyme activity, with optimal conditions necessary for maximum enzyme function. The control setup is where the test tube contents are maintained at 35°C. This temperature is chosen because it is the optimal temperature for amylase activity. Video26.Effect_of_Temperature_and_pH_on_Enzymes.mp4. e) Presence of enzyme inhibitors. Enzyme activities decrease in presence of enzyme inhibitors and increase in their absence. f) Presence of activators. Enzyme activities increase with presence of enzyme activators and decrease with absence of enzyme activators. • In groups, research on and discuss the effects of enzymes on chemical reactions, list the properties of enzymes, and the names and functions of some enzymes, that work in the human digestive system. Produce a presentation to explain findings. • In groups, design and carry out an experiment to determine the effect of one factor (pH or temperature) on enzyme activity. Share findings with other groups and develop understanding of the effect of pH and temperature on enzyme activity. Check findings against established science theory. [Assignment 4] {know and identify different types of mammalian teeth, and relate their structure and position in the jaw to diet}. Mammalian teeth. Mammalian teeth are hard, calcified structures embedded in the jaws (the upper and the lower). Unlike homodonts, which have teeth of the same size and shape, mammals are typically heterodonts, meaning they have different types and shapes of teeth designed for specific functions, depending on the mammal's diet. Internal structure of mammalian tooth: Each mammalian tooth consists externally of a crown, a neck and a root. The exposed portion of a tooth is called the crown, while the portion anchored in the jawbone is called the root. The crown is used for breaking down food into small particles during chewing, grinding and cutting. The neck is the junction between the crown and the root. The root is the region which lies embedded in the jaw bone. It cannot be seen and it anchors / fixes firmly the root into the jaw bone. Teeth have different number of roots because they perform different functions and therefore require different forms of anchorage into the jaw bone. Figure104.nutrition_in_mammals_image_104.jpg. The internal structure of a mammalian tooth consists of four primary layers: the enamel, dentin, pulp, and cementum. Enamel, the hardest substance in the human body, is composed primarily of calcium phosphate crystals, making it incredibly durable and resistant to wear and tear. It forms the crown's outer layer, providing strength and protection for the tooth. Dentin, a slightly softer material, makes up the bulk of the tooth and is composed of a calcified matrix containing microscopic tubules. These tubules transmit sensations to the pulp, contributing to the tooth's sensitivity. The pulp, located at the tooth's centre, contains blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue, providing nutrients, sensory information, and support for the tooth. Cementum, a thin layer covering the root, is a bone-like substance that helps anchor the tooth to the jawbone. The periodontal ligament, a fibrous tissue, further secures the tooth in place. The gum (gingiva) protects and supports teeth by covering the tooth roots and jawbone. These components work together to form a strong and functional tooth structure, enabling the tooth to perform its essential functions of biting, chewing, and grinding food. Types of teeth in mammals. Mammals have a diverse array of tooth types, each specialised for a particular function. The relative size and number of each tooth type varies among different mammalian species, depending on their diet. In summary, there are 4 types of teeth in mammals: incisors are used for biting and cutting, canines for tearing and piercing, and premolars and molars for chewing, grinding and crushing food. a) Incisors: Incisors are the front teeth in both the upper and lower jaws of humans. They have a chisel-shaped crown with a sharp, flat edge and typically have only one root. Incisors are primarily used for cutting and biting food. Note: Elephant tusks are actually elongated incisors. They are significantly larger and more prominent than typical incisors in other mammals and serve various purposes, such as defence, foraging, and social interactions. b) Canines: Canines are located next to the incisors and are typically long, pointed teeth. They are poorly developed in herbivores, but very prominent in carnivores, where they are used for holding, piercing, and tearing flesh. The crown of a canine is conical shaped, sharp, and pointed. Canines typically have one root. c) Premolars: Premolars are located behind the canines on both jaws and have two roots for firm anchorage into the jawbone. They have flat, broad surfaces with two or more cusps and ridges, which increase the surface area for grinding food. Premolars are primarily used for chewing and grinding food. d) Molars: Molars are typically absent in young mammals and develop later in life. They have wider crowns with more ridges and cusps compared to premolars, providing a larger surface area for grinding food. Molars may have three or more roots for firm anchorage into the jawbone. They are primarily used for grinding and crushing food, especially tough materials like meat and plant matter. Video27.Different_Types_of_Teeth.mp4. Dentition refers to the number, arrangement, and shape of teeth in an animal. Teeth performing the same role are positioned together in the same region of the mouth, to provide a large surface area which increases their efficiency in pertaining their function. Most mammals, including humans, have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: milk teeth and permanent teeth. The milk teeth, which appear in early childhood, are 20 in number for humans and are replaced by 32 permanent teeth between the ages of 7 and 11. Dental formula is a standardised notation that indicates the number of each type of tooth in half of the upper jaw and half of the lower jaw. It provides valuable insights into an animal's diet and evolutionary adaptations. In the dental formula, the number of teeth in the upper jaw is listed above that in the lower jaw. The different types of teeth are represented by the following letters: Incisors (I), Canines (C), Premolars (P), and Molars (M). Dental formula of human (Adult): I 2/2, C 1/1, P 2/2, M 3/3 = 32. This means that man has 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars on each half on the upper and lower jaws. Therefore, adult man has 8 teeth on each half on the jaws which adds up a total of 32 teeth. Dental formulae of other omnivores. Pig: I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 3/3 = 44. Bear: I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. However, many adult bears lose their anterior premolars, leading to a reduced dental formula of I 3/3, C 1/1, P 2/2, M 2/3 = 34. The dental formulas of humans, pigs, and bears reflect their omnivorous diets. While the overall structure is similar, slight variations in the number of premolars among pigs and bears can be attributed to their individual dietary preferences. Carnivore dentition: Carnivorous animals such as dogs, cats and lions are adapted for feeding on other animals. Their teeth are adapted for capturing and killing other animals and tearing their flesh. Their incisors are chisel shaped and enable them to grip and strip off pieces of flesh from bones. Their canines are long, curved and pointed for piercing the prey and preventing it from escaping. The fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar are large and powerful. They are called the carnassial teeth. The carnassial teeth are adapted for cracking bones and scrapping (removing) meat from them, overlapping like the blades of scissors to effectively tear and slice flesh. The other premolars and molars have jagged edges that fit perfectly together making them ideal for cracking bones. Dental formulae of some carnivores. Dog: I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. Cat: I 3/3, C 1/1, P 3/2, M 1/1 = 30. While dogs and cats share a similar dental formula structure, the cat's fewer premolars may reflect its more specialised diet. A drawing of the dentition of a dog: Figure105.nutrition_in_mammals_image_105.jpg. Herbivore dentition: Herbivorous animals, such as cows, goats, and elephants, have dentition adapted for consuming plant foods like grass, leaves, and small stems. Their incisors and canines are chisel-shaped and found only in the lower jaw. In the upper jaw, a thick horny pad replaces these teeth, aiding in grasping and plucking grass. A large gap called the diastema separates the front teeth from the cheek teeth, allowing the tongue to manipulate vegetation effectively in such a way that the material being chewed is kept away from that which is freshly gathered. Dental formulas of some herbivores: Sheep: I 0/4, C 0/0, P 3/3, M 3/3 = 32. Horse: I 3/3, C 1/1 (often rudimentary or absent in females), P 3-4/3, M 3/3 = 36-42. Cow (Bovine): I 0/3, C 0/1, P 3/3, M 3/3 = 32. Rabbit: I 2/1, C 0/0, P 3/2, M 3/3 = 28. Drawing of the dentition of a sheep: Figure106.nutrition_in_mammals_image_106.jpg. • In pairs, observe a molar, canine, pre-molar and incisor tooth and identify: • the common structural features of each of the teeth in a mammal • the adaptations of each type of tooth to its function • Make an accurate labelled drawing of each tooth and state the magnification. • In pairs, research on and write the dental formula for an herbivore, a carnivore and an omnivore. [Assignment 5] {Understand the importance of oral hygiene, and describe good practice in caring for teeth and gums in humans}. Oral hygiene refers to the maintenance of a clean surface and interior of the mouth especially the teeth, tongue and gums. Although hard, teeth are delicate and need proper care if their life is to be sustained. To keep teeth and gums healthy, prevent bad breath, have a whiter and brighter smile and to prevent tooth loss, certain teeth diseases and complications, one should practice good dental hygiene. Common problems that may arise if teeth are not cared for include: a) Tooth decay, also known as dental caries or cavities. This is caused by lodging (when food gets stuck) of food particles especially sugars between the teeth. This food is then attacked by micro-organisms (bacteria) which ferment this food producing an acid which reacts chemically with the enamel and removes calcium from it making it soft. During chewing, the soft part of the enamel begins wearing away, forming a hole which gets larger and larger as more food gets stuck in the now bigger hole and fermentation process continues. Tooth ache commences into the dentine, the pulp cavity with nerves and blood vessels gets affected and a lot of pain is felt. Bacteria then infect the base of the tooth forming an abscess; painful and swollen gums which can lead to brain abscesses if not treated early. Note: Low fluoride levels in drinking water can also cause tooth decay. Treatment: Cavities can be filled if they are not too deep. If the decay has progressed significantly, the tooth may need to be extracted. Alternatively, in some cases, the living part of the tooth, which includes the nerves and pulp, can be removed through a root canal, effectively killing the tooth. While the tooth can remain in place and still function mechanically, it will no longer be sensitive to pain or temperature. b) Calculus: The yellowish marks near the gums are known as plaque or calculus, formed when bacteria in the mouth combine with sugars and substances from saliva. Calculus is a hard, stone-like substance often deposited where the tooth meets the gum. It can be scaled off by a dentist, and any resulting cavities may need to be filled with dental cement. If not removed promptly, plaque hardens into tartar, which encourages bacteria to attack the periodontal membrane. As the periodontal membrane is further destroyed, the tooth may become loose and eventually fall out. c) Periodontal diseases: Also known as gum diseases, periodontal diseases are infections that affect the tissues surrounding the teeth. They can cause the gums to become inflamed, swollen, and eventually pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that can accumulate bacteria and debris. This can lead to gum bleeding, bad breath, and pus discharge. The two main types of periodontal diseases are gingivitis and pyorrhoea, also known as periodontitis. Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease, characterised by red, swollen gums that may bleed when brushed. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, a more severe form that involves the destruction of the bone and tissue supporting the teeth. Treatment for periodontal diseases often involves professional cleaning to remove plaque and tartar buildup, as well as at-home care, including regular brushing, flossing, and using a mouthwash. In severe cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to treat deep pockets, regenerate bone, or even extract damaged teeth. Note: Poor dental hygiene can lead to bad breath through the buildup of plaque and tartar, trapped food particles, tooth decay, and gum disease, all of which produce foul-smelling compounds. Proper care of teeth: Regularly visiting a dentist for checkups is essential to detect and address any dental issues early. Proper cleaning of teeth includes brushing at least twice a day, ideally after meals. It is recommended to replace your toothbrush every three months because a new toothbrush is more effective at removing plaque than a worn one. Using toothpaste that contains fluoride is important because fluoride helps protect teeth from decay. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel by promoting remineralisation and making teeth more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria in plaque, which helps prevent tooth decay and cavities. During athletic activities, it is advisable to protect your teeth with a mouthguard. If you grind your teeth during sleep, using a night guard can help prevent damage. Avoid sweet and sugary foods like sweets, as they encourage bacterial growth, leading to tooth decay. Misusing your teeth, such as cracking nuts or opening bottle tops, can also cause damage and should be avoided. Additionally, it is important to avoid consuming very hot and very cold foods in quick succession, as the alternating expansion and contraction can lead to cracking or chipping of the enamel. Eating foods rich in calcium, phosphates, and vitamins A, D, and C supports healthy teeth. Finally, exercising your teeth by eating hard, fibrous foods like sugarcane and carrots stimulates the flow of saliva, which neutralises acids formed from bacterial fermentation, further protecting your teeth. • In pairs, share experience and research on reasons for, and methods of ensuring dental hygiene as well as consequences of poor hygiene. Produce a short good practice guide. [Assignment 6] {Explore the structure of the different parts of the mammalian alimentary canal, and its role in the digestion of food}. Digestion in man. Digestion is the process by which complex food substances are broken down into simpler, soluble compounds that can be absorbed and assimilated (utilised) by the body. It involves both physical and chemical processes. Physical digestion includes the mechanical breakdown of food through the action of teeth, muscular contractions, and bile juice, while chemical digestion involves the enzymatic breakdown of food. In humans, digestion is considered extracellular because it occurs outside the cells, within the gut cavity where enzymes are released. This contrasts with intracellular digestion, which occurs within the cells, as seen in organisms like amoebas and paramecia. The digestive process includes several steps: ingestion, where food is taken into the body; digestion, where it is broken down; and egestion, where insoluble, undigested food compounds are expelled from the body as faeces. The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and associated organs that secrete digestive juices, enabling these processes to occur effectively. Figure107.nutrition_in_mammals_image_107.jpg. The human alimentary canal. Figure108.nutrition_in_mammals_image_108.jpg. Figure109.nutrition_in_mammals_image_109.jpg. Parts of the alimentary canal. The alimentary canal, also known as the digestive tract or gastrointestinal tract, is a continuous tube-like structure in the body that processes food from ingestion to excretion. Extending from the mouth to the anus, it is responsible for the digestion and absorption of nutrients, as well as the elimination of waste. The tubular shape of the canal facilitates the passage of food, and its length varies depending on the animal's diet, being longest in herbivores and shortest in carnivores. In herbivores, the longer alimentary canal is necessary for the more complex digestion of plant material, which often requires more time and a larger surface area for effective nutrient absorption. The canal is divided into several compartments, beginning with the mouth. The mouth contains the teeth and salivary glands and opens into the large space called the buccal cavity. The roof of the mouth is formed by the hard palate, which continues into the soft palate that leads to the pharynx. Once food enters the buccal cavity, the teeth break it down into smaller particles, increasing the surface area for enzyme action. The tongue, a long muscular organ on the floor of the cavity, is covered with taste buds and moves food around the mouth for chewing and mixing with saliva. Saliva, secreted by the salivary glands, contains mucus that moistens, softens, and lubricates the food, forming it into boluses for easy swallowing. The enzyme in saliva, called salivary amylase (ptyalin), begins the chemical digestion of carbohydrates in the mouth. Oesophagus/gullet: The oesophagus, also known as the gullet, is a straight tube that extends from the mouth (oral cavity) through the thorax (chest cavity) and diaphragm (muscular partition) into the abdomen (abdominal cavity). Its primary function is to transport food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach by means of rhythmic muscular contractions known as peristalsis. The stomach: The stomach is the organ where the oesophagus (gullet) opens into, and it plays a crucial role in digestion. At the entrance of the stomach is the cardiac sphincter muscle, a circular band of muscle that controls the passage of food from the oesophagus into the stomach, preventing backflow. At the exit of the stomach, leading to the small intestine, is the pyloric sphincter muscle, another circular band of muscle that regulates the movement of partially digested food from the stomach into the duodenum, ensuring proper digestion before the food moves on. The small intestine: The small intestine is a long, coiled tube, approximately 6-7 meters in length in humans, and is responsible for most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients. It is made up of three main parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, measuring about 25 to 30 centimetres in length. It is characterised by its short and wider structure compared to the other sections and bends into a loop to accommodate the pancreas. Several ducts open into the duodenum: the bile duct from the liver and gall bladder, which delivers bile for fat emulsification, and the pancreatic duct from the pancreas, which delivers digestive enzymes and bicarbonate to neutralise stomach acid. Following the duodenum is the jejunum, the middle part of the small intestine, which is approximately 2.5 meters long. The jejunum is primarily involved in the absorption of sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. It has a highly folded inner surface to facilitate the absorption process. The final part of the small intestine is the ileum, which measures about 3 to 4 meters in length. The ileum is long and coiled and plays a crucial role in absorbing a significant portion of nutrients, including vitamin B₁₂ and bile salts. Its inner lining is covered with numerous tiny finger-like projections called villi (singular—villus), which significantly increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption into the bloodstream. The large intestine: The large intestine in humans consists of the colon, appendix, and rectum, and it opens at the anus. Digestion in the mouth: Digestion in the mouth begins with the intake of food through the mouth, a process known as ingestion. Digestion in the mouth involves both physical and chemical processes. Physical digestion is primarily carried out by the action of the teeth through mastication, or chewing. Mastication increases the surface area of food for more efficient enzyme action. It mixes the food with saliva and in so doing, it softens the food, mixes it with the enzymes and lubricates it with the mucus in the saliva. With the help of the tongue, the food is rolled into a bolus (a small ball) for easy swallowing and movement in the gut (alimentary canal). The tongue aids in rolling the food into a bolus and moving it around the mouth. Chewing stimulates saliva secretion, which is a reflex action triggered not only by the presence of food but also by the sight, smell, and thought of food. Chemical digestion in the mouth is facilitated by the enzyme salivary amylase (ptyalin), present in saliva. Saliva, which has a pH normal range of 6.2-7.6 with 6.7 being the average pH, creates a slightly acidic to neutral environment that is suitable for amylase activity. Salivary amylase acts only on cooked starch, breaking it down to a disaccharide called maltose. Swallowing is a reflex action. Once the food is chewed and formed into a bolus, the tongue pushes it to the back of the mouth, where it is transferred to the oesophagus (gullet). During swallowing, breathing momentarily stops. The epiglottis closes off the trachea to prevent food from entering the lungs, while the soft palate closes off the nasal cavity to prevent food from escaping through the nose. The bolus then moves down the oesophagus through a wave-like motion of muscular contractions known as peristalsis. An experiment to identify which substances are digested in the mouth: To determine which substances are digested in the mouth, label six test tubes as 1 to 6. Add one teaspoonful of boiled rice, mashed boiled egg albumen, and mashed groundnut to test tubes 1, 3, and 5, respectively. In test tubes 2, 4, and 6, add one teaspoonful of boiled rice, boiled egg albumen, and boiled groundnuts that have been chewed in the mouth for 4 minutes, respectively. Add 3cm³ of water to all test tubes. Perform an iodine test and Benedict's test on the contents of test tubes 1 and 2, a Biuret test on the contents of test tubes 3 and 4, and a lipid test on the contents of test tubes 5 and 6. Observations show that the Benedict's test is negative for test tube 1, the iodine test is negative for test tube 2, and the other tests are all positive. This indicates that only starch is digested in the mouth, while lipids and proteins are not. Test tubes 1, 3, and 5 serve as control experiments. • In your groups, with the guidance of your teacher, design a controlled experiment to determine what substances are digested in the mouth: • include the hypothesis • describe the experimental design • indicate the control group(s) • describe the results of the test. Digestion in the stomach: Digestion in the stomach primarily involves chemical processes. Food enters the stomach from the oesophagus through a ring of muscle known as the cardiac sphincter. In the stomach, protein digestion occurs, facilitated by gastric juice, secreted by the gastric glands, in response to the presence of food. Gastric juice contains two major enzymes (pepsin & rennin), hydrochloric acid (HCl), mucus, and water. Pepsin, secreted initially as the inactive enzyme pepsinogen, is activated to its active form by hydrochloric acid. This activation prevents self-digestion of the stomach lining, as pepsin would otherwise digest the proteinaceous walls of the stomach. Pepsin functions in the acidic environment provided by hydrochloric acid, breaking down proteins into polypeptides. Similarly, rennin, also present in gastric juice, is initially secreted in its inactive form, prorennin. Prorennin is activated to rennin by hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Rennin coagulates milk by converting the soluble milk protein caseinogen into an insoluble curd called casein. This curd formation is crucial for young mammals who primarily consume milk and is also important in cheesemaking. Once casein is formed, pepsin acts upon the insoluble curd, further breaking it down into smaller polypeptides and peptides, continuing the protein digestion process. Mucus, secreted by the stomach lining, forms a protective barrier between the stomach walls and gastric juice. This mucus shields the stomach lining from the corrosive effects of hydrochloric acid, which could otherwise lead to ulcers, and also inhibits the action of pepsin and rennin, preventing damage to the stomach walls. The water in gastric juice dissolves and dilutes its components, ensuring thorough mixing with food and aiding in digestion. Functions of hydrochloric acid (HCl): In the stomach, HCl serves several critical functions. It kills some bacteria present in ingested food, reducing the risk of infection. HCl activates pepsin and rennin, providing the optimal acidic environment for their enzymatic activity. It also halts the action of salivary amylase, ensuring that protein digestion is the primary focus in the stomach. Additionally, HCl prevents the fermentation of food by bacteria in the stomach. Note: There is limited digestion of lipids in the stomach. Lipids are primarily emulsified by mechanical churning and partially digested by gastric lipase; another enzyme found in gastric juice. This acid-resistant enzyme begins breaking down triglycerides into diglycerides and free fatty acids. However, the majority of lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine. Digestion in the duodenum: Digestion in the duodenum involves the addition of bile from the gall bladder and pancreatic juice from the pancreas. Chyme, the semi-fluid mass of partially digested food mixed with gastric juices, enters the duodenum in small quantities at a time, regulated by the pyloric sphincter. The arrival of chyme stimulates the production of hormones such as secretin and cholecystokinin. Secretin prompts the pancreas to secrete alkaline pancreatic juice, which neutralises the acidic chyme from the stomach, creating an optimal pH for enzyme activity. Cholecystokinin stimulates the gall bladder to release bile into the duodenum. The primary function of bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, is to reduce the surface tension of fats through emulsification, breaking them into minute droplets and increasing their surface area for more efficient digestion by pancreatic lipase. Additionally, bile contains a high percentage of water, which is added to the chyme, reducing its viscosity and aiding its movement through the digestive tract. Pancreatic juice, containing sodium bicarbonate, neutralises stomach acid, while water dissolves digestive enzymes and nutrients. The juice also contains several key enzymes: pancreatic amylase, which continues the breakdown of starches; trypsin, secreted as trypsinogen and activated to trypsin by enterokinase in the duodenum, breaking down proteins into smaller polypeptides; chymotrypsin, secreted as chymotrypsinogen and activated by trypsin to further break down proteins into shorter peptides; carboxypeptidase, activated from procarboxypeptidase by trypsin to remove amino acids from the carboxyl end of peptides; elastase, activated from proelastase by trypsin to break down elastin proteins in connective tissue; and lipase, which breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. These components collectively ensure that carbohydrates, proteins, and fats not fully digested in the stomach are efficiently processed in the duodenum. Digestion in the ileum: Final digestion occurs in the ileum, the last section of the small intestine. Food moves from the duodenum into the ileum through peristalsis, a series of coordinated muscle contractions. The presence of food stimulates the secretion of intestinal juice, known as succus entericus, from the mucosal lining of the ileum. Succus entericus contains several key enzymes: maltase breaks down maltose into glucose, lactase hydrolyses lactose into glucose and galactose, and sucrase converts sucrose into glucose and fructose. Additionally, peptidases, including aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases, further digest peptides into amino acids. These enzymes complete the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The resulting mixture is a milky fluid called chyle, which contains the soluble end products of digestion: glucose, fructose, amino acids, glycerol, vitamins, and mineral salts. Although some absorption occurs in the ileum, the absorption of nutrients begins earlier in the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum and the jejunum, and continues throughout the small intestine, with the ileum playing a significant role in absorbing the remaining nutrients and transferring them into the bloodstream for the body to utilise. The large intestine: The large intestine, which includes the colon, appendix, and rectum, plays a crucial role in the final stages of waste processing and elimination. There is no digestion in the large intestine! Undigested and indigestible food substances, along with any unabsorbed nutrients, pass into the large intestine, where water and mineral salts are reabsorbed in the colon. This reabsorption is vital for maintaining the body's fluid and electrolyte balance, preventing dehydration and ensuring the formation of solid stool. The colon, the major part of the large intestine, is the primary site for this process, helping to form and store faeces, which are temporarily held in the rectum, the final segment of the large intestine, before being expelled through the anus in a process called egestion. The appendix, a small tube-like structure attached to the colon, is believed to have an immune function, though it can become inflamed if hard particles like stones and small sticks accumulate, leading to appendicitis, which often requires surgical removal. In many herbivorous animals, particularly smaller ones like rabbits and guinea pigs, the large intestine is adapted to include a large caecum where plant material is fermented by microorganisms, allowing for efficient digestion of fibrous content. Sample questions: Question 1: Describe the digestion process that occurs when a person consumes posho. When posho (cooked starch) is ingested, it first undergoes physical digestion in the mouth as it is chewed by the teeth into smaller particles. The sight, smell, thought, and presence of food in the mouth stimulate the production of saliva, which aids in swallowing and contains the enzyme salivary amylase. Salivary amylase begins the chemical digestion of the cooked starch in posho, breaking it down into maltose. After chewing, the food is pushed down the oesophagus by peristalsis, a process of rhythmic contractions. In the stomach, starch digestion halts due to the acidic environment created by hydrochloric acid, which inactivates salivary amylase. The food, now called chyme, moves into the duodenum where the acidic chyme stimulates the secretion of pancreatic juice. This juice contains pancreatic amylase in its active form, which continues the breakdown of undigested starch into maltose. In the ileum, the presence of chyme stimulates the secretion of intestinal juice, also known as succus entericus, from the intestinal walls. This juice contains maltase, which converts maltose into glucose molecules. These glucose molecules are soluble and easily absorbed by the body through the intestinal lining, completing the digestion of posho. Question 2: Describe the process of digestion of proteins in man. When proteins are ingested, they first undergo physical digestion in the mouth as they are chewed by the teeth into smaller pieces. The sight, smell, thought and presence of food in the mouth stimulates the production of saliva, which aids in swallowing but does not contribute to protein digestion. The food is then pushed down the oesophagus by peristalsis, a process of rhythmic contractions. In the stomach, the presence of food stimulates the secretion of gastrin hormone into the blood stream, which stimulates the gastric glands to secrete gastric juice, which contains pepsin and rennin. Rennin, initially secreted as prorennin, its inactive form, is activated to rennin in the acidic environment of the stomach. Rennin is especially important for digesting milk proteins in young mammals, converting the soluble milk protein caseinogen into insoluble casein. Pepsin is initially secreted as pepsinogen, its inactive form, and is activated to pepsin by hydrochloric acid. Pepsin begins breaking down proteins and casein into smaller polypeptides. As the partially digested food, now called chyme, moves into the duodenum, the acidic chyme stimulates the secretion of pancreatic juice, which contains several key enzymes in their inactive forms: trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypeptidase. Trypsinogen is activated to trypsin by the enzyme enterokinase; trypsin then activates chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin and procarboxypeptidase to carboxypeptidase. These enzymes further break down polypeptides into shorter peptides. In the ileum, the final stage of protein digestion occurs. The presence of food in the ileum stimulates the secretion of intestinal juice, also known as succus entericus, from the intestinal walls. This juice contains peptidases that break down peptides into individual amino acids. The amino acids are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining, completing the digestion of proteins.

[Assignment 7] {How are the end products of digestion absorbed and assimilated}. Nutrient absorption is the process by which soluble products of digestion pass through the cellular lining of the digestive tract into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. This primarily occurs in the small intestine, which includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The ileum is particularly well-adapted for nutrient uptake due to its extensive coiling and folding, which provides a large surface area for absorption. Its inner surface is lined with villi—finger-like projections that further enhance the surface area for absorption, and these villi are covered with microvilli, tiny hair-like extensions, forming a brush border that further amplifies the absorptive surface area, maximising nutrient uptake. The epithelial cells of the ileum have a thin, single-cell layer that reduces the diffusion distance, allowing for more efficient transport of nutrients. The villi and microvilli are densely packed with blood capillaries and lacteals—small lymphatic vessels. This extensive network of blood vessels and lacteals maintains a steep concentration gradient, ensuring that absorbed nutrients quickly enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Nutrients are absorbed through various transport mechanisms. Glucose, galactose and amino acids are absorbed into the blood capillaries of the villi via active transport, which requires energy to move these molecules against their concentration gradients. Fructose enters the blood capillaries through facilitated diffusion, a passive process that does not require energy. Once absorbed, glucose, amino acids, and fructose are transported via the hepatic portal vein to the liver for further processing. Diagram of villus. Figure110.nutrition_in_mammals_image_110.jpg. Fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed into lacteals, part of the lymphatic system, through passive diffusion and are subsequently distributed throughout the body. Vitamins and minerals are absorbed through both passive and active transport mechanisms into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and some minerals are absorbed via passive diffusion into the lymphatic system or blood capillaries, depending on their solubility. Other minerals, such as calcium, require active transport mechanisms to move into the bloodstream. The small intestine also contains enzymes and transport proteins that facilitate these processes. Although the primary site for nutrient absorption is the small intestine, the large intestine also plays a role by absorbing water and minerals from the remaining indigestible food matter, forming faeces. In contrast, drugs are absorbed more rapidly from the stomach due to their direct exposure to the bloodstream, bypassing the more extensive digestion and absorption processes that nutrients undergo in the small intestine. The efficiency of nutrient absorption can be influenced by the health of the intestinal lining and various digestive disorders. • In groups, simulate the process of digestion, its products and their absorption using either: • labelled cards with names of parts of the alimentary canal and different food types • strings of beads that can be linked and unlinked • role play (holding hands to form long chain molecules, releasing hands when ‘digested’ to become small sub-units that can be absorbed) • Produce annotated diagrams to explain your understanding of digestion and absorption. Assimilation: The absorbed nutrients are transported through blood vessels and lacteals to various organs of the body, where they are utilised for different functions. This process, known as assimilation, involves incorporating these absorbed nutrients into the body’s metabolism. During assimilation, nutrients may undergo anabolism, where they are built up into complex molecules necessary for growth and repair, or catabolism, where they are broken down to release energy. Additionally, excess nutrients may be stored in the liver, muscles, or adipose tissue for future use, ensuring a steady supply of energy and building materials when needed. The efficiency of assimilation depends on factors such as nutrient availability, the health of the digestive, circulatory, and lymphatic systems, and the body’s overall metabolic rate. Assimilation and metabolism for carbohydrates (glucose): Glucose is primarily metabolised through cellular respiration to provide energy for the body’s metabolic processes. In the presence of oxygen, glucose undergoes aerobic respiration in the mitochondria, producing ATP, carbon dioxide, and water. Excess glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, which serves as a short-term energy reserve. When blood glucose levels drop, such as during fasting, prolonged exercise, or between meals, the liver converts glycogen back into glucose through glycogenolysis to maintain stable blood sugar levels and supply energy to cells. Additionally, glucose can be converted into fat via lipogenesis and stored in adipose tissue for long-term energy storage. The regulation of glucose metabolism is controlled by hormones like insulin, which facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells, and glucagon, which stimulates glycogen breakdown and glucose release into the bloodstream. Additionally, imbalances in glucose metabolism can lead to conditions such as diabetes mellitus, where insulin production or function is impaired, affecting blood sugar regulation and overall metabolic health. Proteins (amino acids): Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, are crucial for synthesising new proteins, including regulatory proteins like enzymes and hormones, which are essential for various bodily functions. Amino acids also play a vital role in body growth and repair and are involved in synthesising neurotransmitters and supporting the immune system. In the absence of sufficient glucose and fats, amino acids can be used as an alternative source of energy through gluconeogenesis, where they are converted into glucose. Unlike carbohydrates and fats, excess amino acids are not stored in the body. Instead, they undergo deamination in the liver, where the amino group is removed to form urea, a toxic waste product. This urea is then transported to the kidneys, where it is excreted from the body through urine. Deamination is a critical process that ensures the safe removal of excess nitrogen from amino acids, preventing its accumulation in the body. Additionally, the body continuously undergoes protein turnover, balancing protein breakdown and synthesis to maintain cellular functions and metabolic processes. Essential amino acids must be obtained from the diet, while non-essential amino acids can be synthesised by the body. Lipids (fatty acids & glycerol): When glucose is unavailable, fatty acids and glycerol can be oxidised to release energy, with fats yielding more energy per unit mass compared to glucose. This makes lipids an efficient energy source. In addition to their role in energy production, fats are crucial for body insulation, preventing heat loss and aiding in temperature regulation. Lipids are also essential in forming structural components of cells, including cell membranes, where they contribute to membrane fluidity and function. Excess fatty acids and glycerol are stored in adipose tissue beneath the skin, serving as a long-term energy reserve and providing cushioning to protect internal organs. While fats are essential, an imbalance, particularly an excess of saturated and trans fats, can contribute to health issues like cardiovascular diseases. Vitamins: Vitamins are assimilated based on their solubility. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are absorbed with dietary fats, enter intestinal cells, and are transported via chylomicrons in the lymphatic system to the bloodstream for storage in the liver and adipose tissue. They are used directly for functions such as vision (Vitamin A), calcium absorption (Vitamin D), antioxidant protection (Vitamin E), and blood clotting (Vitamin K). Water-soluble vitamins (B-complex and C) are absorbed directly into the bloodstream and used immediately for processes like energy production and immune support. Unlike many nutrients, vitamins are often used directly without extensive metabolic processing, and excess water-soluble vitamins are excreted in urine. Mineral salts: Mineral salts are assimilated based on their solubility and physiological need. Absorbed primarily in the small intestine, these minerals enter the bloodstream and are transported to various tissues to perform specific functions. Essential minerals such as calcium and phosphorus support bone health, sodium and potassium regulate fluid balance and nerve function, and iron is crucial for oxygen transport in haemoglobin. Minerals are used in their absorbed form for these roles, and excess amounts are typically excreted through urine or faeces to maintain balance and prevent toxicity. • Use a variety of methods (e.g., involving a food scientist, book and internet research, and animations) to understand the meaning of assimilation and how the body uses each of the following nutrients: • carbohydrates • lipids • proteins • mineral salts • vitamins. Document your findings in a mind map or spider diagram. The liver: As the largest organ in the body, the liver serves as a crucial metabolic centre, processing nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract. Carbohydrates and proteins are transported directly to the liver through the hepatic portal vein. Lipids, on the other hand, are absorbed into the lymphatic system after digestion and then transported to the liver via the bloodstream. The liver plays several essential roles, including regulating blood glucose levels by storing excess glucose as glycogen and converting it back to glucose as needed. It synthesises plasma proteins such as albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen, which are crucial for blood clotting and maintaining blood volume. Additionally, the liver produces bile, which aids in the emulsification and digestion of lipids. The liver is also responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol, which is vital for cell membrane integrity and hormone production. It stores iron and other minerals, which are recycled for the production of new red blood cells, in conjunction with vitamin B₁₂, and it synthesises certain vitamins such as vitamin A from beta-carotene. The liver can act as a blood reservoir with a capacity of 300 to 1500 cm³ and contributes to temperature regulation through heat production from metabolic reactions. It also plays a role in the immune system by filtering blood and removing pathogens and debris. Furthermore, the liver detoxifies harmful substances by converting ammonia into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys, and processes sex hormones like testosterone and oestrogen for elimination. Additionally, the liver is involved in drug metabolism, modifying substances for easier excretion. Digestion in herbivores. Herbivores, which rely on plant materials such as leaves, wood, and grass, face the challenge of digesting cellulose, the primary component of plant cell walls. Cellulose must be broken down to access the nutrients inside plant cells, which are essential for the herbivore's diet. However, herbivores themselves cannot secrete the enzyme cellulase needed to digest cellulose. Instead, they rely on a mutualistic relationship with certain protozoans and bacteria capable of producing cellulase. These micro-organisms reside in the herbivores' digestive tracts, benefiting from the habitat and nutrients provided by the herbivore, while the herbivore, in turn, benefits from the micro-organisms' ability to break down cellulose, thereby aiding in the digestion of plant material. Ruminants and non-ruminants share some similarities in their digestive processes, such as having a single-chambered stomach in young animals, with final digestion of proteins and carbohydrates occurring in the small intestine for both. Enzymes like amylase, lipase, and protease play crucial roles in nutrient breakdown, and the small intestine is the primary site for nutrient absorption. Saliva aids initial digestion and lubrication, while the liver and pancreas support digestion through bile production and digestive enzymes. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract, and waste is excreted through the large intestine and rectum. Fats are emulsified by bile and broken down by lipases in both types of animals. However, ruminants have a complex, multi-chambered stomach specialised for fermenting and breaking down fibrous plant material, with cellulose digestion facilitated by rumen microorganisms. Non-ruminants, with their single-chambered stomachs, lack a rumen and thus cannot efficiently digest cellulose, relying instead on dietary starches and proteins. Fermentation in non-ruminants occurs in the cecum and large intestine, but it is less efficient. Additionally, ruminants engage in cud chewing, regurgitating partially digested food for further breakdown, whereas non-ruminants do not practice rumination and chew their food only once during initial ingestion. Ruminants are generally herbivores consuming fibrous plant material, while non-ruminants can be omnivores, herbivores, or carnivores, depending on their diet. Digestion of cellulose in ruminants: Ruminants are mammals that chew cud, partially chewed plant material that is swallowed into the stomach and later brought back to the mouth for further chewing through regurgitation. These animals have a complex stomach with four chambers: the rumen (a large storage and fermentation chamber), reticulum (where food is sieved and bacterial action continues), omasum (a compartment with leaf-like structures that finely grinds food and absorbs water), and abomasum (the "true stomach" where enzymatic digestion of proteins occurs). In the mouth, saliva doesn't contain any enzymes, so mastication (chewing) and softening of food occur before it moves through the oesophagus via peristalsis. The rumen, the largest stomach chamber, serves as a storage area and is where fermentation and cellulose digestion by bacteria and protozoa take place. Fermentation, a process where bacteria break down food in the absence of oxygen, releases lactic acid and other volatile fatty acids, some of which are absorbed directly through the rumen wall. This fermentation process also produces gases, including methane, which the ruminant releases through belching. The rumen's environment is slightly acidic, and the ruminant's saliva buffers this acidity to maintain a stable pH that is conducive to microbial activity. Additionally, microbes in the rumen synthesise essential nutrients like B vitamins and amino acids, which the ruminant absorbs. After this, food moves from the rumen to the reticulum, where bacterial action continues, and the food is sieved, separating finely ground materials from coarse ones. Regurgitation occurs here as food returns to the mouth for further chewing. The omasum, with its leaf-like structures, grinds food finely and absorbs water. The final chamber, the abomasum, functions similarly to the human stomach, where enzymatic digestion of proteins takes place, and digestion proceeds in a similar manner to that in humans. Digestion of cellulose in termites: Termites consume wood, dry leaves, and other plant materials rich in cellulose. The digestion of cellulose in termites occurs in their gut, specifically the stomach, with the assistance of protozoans that live mutualistically within the termite's gut. These protozoa produce the enzyme cellulase, which is essential for breaking down cellulose into simpler sugars that the termite can absorb and utilise for energy. Unlike ruminants, which rely on a complex, multi-chambered stomach with diverse microorganisms for fermentation, termites depend primarily on protozoans in a simpler digestive system. While ruminants undergo a more extensive fermentation process involving repeated chewing (cud), termites achieve cellulose digestion through a more direct process facilitated by their gut protozoans. This mutualistic relationship benefits both organisms, as the protozoans receive a stable environment and nutrients, while the termite gains the ability to digest cellulose, a process it cannot perform on its own;
