Assignment 1 {Identify the observable external features of a housefly, cockroach, mosquito, termite, bee, and butterfly (No details of mouth parts required)}. Among the numerous orders of class Insecta (approximately 30 orders), Coleoptera (beetles) stands out as the most diverse, characterised by a pair of hardened forewings (elytra) that protect the delicate hindwings. Notable examples include the ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata), Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica), scarab beetle (Scarabaeus sacer), and firefly (Photinus pyralis). Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) is another notable order, characterised by large, multifaceted eyes, elongated bodies, and two pairs of strong, membranous wings. Dragonflies, such as the common hawker (Aeshna juncea), are agile predators, often found near aquatic habitats. Hemiptera (true bugs) features insects with piercing-sucking mouthparts adapted for feeding on plant sap or animal fluids. Examples include aphids (Aphis gossypii), the green shield bug (Palomena prasina), and various stink bugs (Pentatomidae). Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets) features insects with hind legs adapted for jumping. Examples include the field grasshopper (Chorthippus parallelus), migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), and two-spotted cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus). The order Siphonaptera comprises the fleas, wingless insects highly adapted for ectoparasitism on mammals and birds. Characterised by laterally compressed bodies, strong hind legs for jumping, and mouthparts specialised for piercing skin and sucking blood, fleas are significant vectors of diseases such as plague and typhus. The order Hemiptera (true bugs) includes species such as the green shield bug (Palomena prasina) and various stink bugs (Pentatomidae). The order Diptera (true flies) is distinguished by a single functional pair of wings, with the second pair reduced to halteres, which provide flight stability. Prominent species include the housefly (Musca domestica), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), mosquito (Anopheles gambiae), and tsetse fly (Glossina spp.). The housefly exhibits several distinctive external features. Fine sensory hairs cover its body and its rounded head houses three simple eyes (ocelli) arranged in a triangle and a pair of large, prominent reddish compound eyes, providing a wide field of vision. Short, bristle-like antennae with three segments, the last bearing spine-like hairs, are present. The mouthparts of a housefly are adapted for sucking and sponging, with the labium (upper lip) modified into a proboscis ending in a sponge-like labellum that uses grooves to absorb liquid food, with saliva aiding in dissolving solids. The grey-brown thorax, marked with four dark longitudinal stripes, supports a single pair of membranous wings for flight and a pair of halteres (reduced hindwings) for balance. Three pairs of hairy legs, each segmented into coxa, femur, tibia, and tarsus, are attached to the thorax. The legs end in sharp claws and pulvilli (singular: pulvillus), which are fleshy sticky pads enabling it to walk effectively on smooth or vertical surfaces, including ceilings. The abdomen is slightly hairy, soft, and segmented, tapering towards the rear. Cerci are either reduced or absent. Figure230.1.6.insects_image_001.jpg. The mosquito (Anopheles or Culex or Aedes species), a slender insect, majorly found in the tropics, has a small head with elongated, thread-like antennae, compound eyes, a proboscis (sharp in females for piercing and sucking blood, adapted for sucking nectar and/or plant juices in males), and sensory hairs aiding navigation and feeding. Figure231.1.6.insects_image_002.jpg. Mosquitoes typically lack prominent stripes, although some species may have subtle markings. The thorax supports a pair of membranous, transparent scaled wings, long, thin legs adapted for perching, and halteres for stability in flight and also sensory in function. The legs terminate in sharp claws and pulvilli, that aid in balance and adhesion while resting or feeding. The elongated abdomen is soft, segmented, and slightly curved, with a pair of spiracles on each segment. When the female mosquito bites someone, she pierces the skin with the stylets and inserts the sucking and salivary tubes. Saliva is secreted into the wound and prevents the blood from clotting and blocking the tubes mean while the labium bends back. A mosquito hates light and likes resting in dark places during the day and comes out to feed at night. Mosquitoes feed mainly within late evening and early morning (day and dawn). Hymenoptera, another significant order, encompasses bees, wasps, and ants, known for their complex social behaviours and vital roles in pollination and ecosystem balance. Examples include the western honeybee (Apis mellifera), common wasp (Vespula vulgaris), wood ant (Formica rufa), and parasitic wasps (Ichneumonidae), which regulate pest populations. Generally, bees are social insects that live in colonies (large numbers) in bee hives. Bumblebees exhibit bold black and yellow stripes as a warning signal to predators. The western honeybee, particularly the worker bee, displays highly specialised external features tailored to its multifaceted roles in the hive. Its rounded, mobile head houses large, prominent compound eyes for broad-spectrum vision, complemented by three simple eyes (ocelli) for detecting light intensity. Short, segmented antennae serve as sensory organs for detecting pheromones, vibrations, and environmental cues. The mouthparts form a modified proboscis, with a curved glossa adapted for lapping nectar and sucking liquids, essential for feeding and hive construction. While not typically characterised by prominent stripes, the thorax has subtle patterns that aid in thermoregulation, social interactions within the hive, and potentially in species recognition. The thorax, robust and muscular, supports two pairs of transparent, membranous wings; the smaller hind wings are interlocked with the forewings using hooks (hamuli), ensuring synchronised flight. Three pairs of legs demonstrate unique adaptations: the forelegs have pollen combs for cleaning pollen off the head, the middle legs feature prongs at the distal tibia for scooping pollen from the baskets, and the hind legs, equipped with dense hairs, pollen brushes, and pollen baskets (corbiculae) on the tibia, carry collected pollen back to the hive. The arolia (singular: arolium) on the tips of their claws aid in grasping surfaces while foraging. Figure232.1.6.insects_image_003.jpg. The segmented abdomen is both flexible and functional, facilitating bending, stretching, breathing, and stinging. The first abdominal segment is fused with the metathorax, providing structural integrity, while the last segment contains a stinger for defence. It is worth noting that the stinger of many female hymenopterans is a modified ovipositor, originally an egg-laying organ. This adaptation serves as a powerful tool for defence and prey immobilisation, rather than its original reproductive function. Additionally, four of the six abdominal segments in worker bees house wax glands, which secrete wax flakes used for building and maintaining the hive structure. These features enable worker bees, the infertile females, the smallest yet most active caste in the hive, excel in various tasks, including cleaning the hive, feeding larvae, foraging for nectar and pollen, storing honey and pollen, producing wax for honeycomb construction, and guarding the hive. Beeswax, produced by honeybees from abdominal glands, is essential for honeycomb construction. Secreted as a liquid, it hardens into scales in the air. Worker bees remove the scales, chew them with saliva, and use the wax to build honeycomb cells. Wax production occurs when there is surplus honey and insufficient honeycomb. Initially clear, beeswax darkens with use and is brittle when cold but softens at body temperature. When a colony becomes queenless, worker bees' reproductive organs can activate, allowing them to lay unfertilised eggs, which develop into drones. In rare cases, this can also occur even when the queen is present, resulting in worker bees laying eggs despite the colony having a queen. The queen, as the only fertile female in the hive, is fed and nursed by the workers and is solely responsible for laying eggs. She is the largest caste, and each hive typically has only one queen. With a sting used to eliminate rival developing queens, she maintains her position within the hive. During her single nuptial flight, the queen leaves the hive accompanied by worker bees and attracts drones from surrounding hives through pheromones that signal her readiness to mate. She mates only once in her lifetime but with multiple drones, which is crucial for genetic diversity within the colony. The drones transfer sperms to the queen, which she stores in a specialised organ called the spermatheca, enabling her to fertilise eggs internally throughout her life. Drones from her own hive generally do not mate with her, as she seeks out drones from other hives to prevent inbreeding. Unfortunately, the drones die shortly after mating, as their reproductive organs are torn away in the process. When a new queen hatches, the old queen leads a swarm of worker bees away from the hive to establish a new colony. As a result, the original hive remains with the new queen, ensuring the continuity of the colony, while the old queen and a portion of the workers form a new colony elsewhere. This swarming process occurs when the colony becomes overcrowded or when environmental conditions are favourable. Worker bees may also kill the queen if she becomes weak or stops producing enough pheromones. They do this by "balling" her—clustering tightly around her until she overheats and dies—before raising a new queen from selected larvae. However, if the queen accidentally dies before a new queen is ready, and there are no larvae available, the colony may struggle to replace the queen, leading to potential instability and decline in the hive’s population. Drones, the only male bees in a colony, primarily exist to mate with queens from other hives, ensuring genetic diversity. In addition to reproduction, drones contribute to hive dynamics in other ways. They assist in temperature regulation by vibrating their bodies to generate warmth, release pheromones that influence the colony's social structure, and can help detect disturbances within the hive due to their sensitivity to vibrations, indirectly supporting colony defence. Despite these roles, drones do not forage, produce wax, or care for brood, relying entirely on worker bees for food and support. During resource scarcity, such as in late autumn or winter, drones are often expelled from the hive or stung to death to conserve resources. The superorder Dictyoptera encompasses the order Blattodea, which includes cockroaches and termites, and the order Mantodea, which includes mantises. These insects share distinctive features such as flattened bodies, long antennae, and a protective pronotum. Mantises, such as the praying mantis (Mantis religiosa), are known for their triangular heads, large, compound eyes, and raptorial forelegs used for capturing prey. Cockroaches, such as the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), are fast-moving scavengers known for their adaptability and resilience. They are nocturnal, reducing their exposure to predators, and can thrive in diverse environments due to their omnivorous diet. They exhibit a range of body sizes and colours, with dorso-ventrally flattened bodies that enable them to squeeze into narrow spaces, and reddish-brown to black exoskeletons providing effective camouflage in dark environments. Their small, pear-shaped head is equipped with long, thin, and flexible antennae that enhance sensory detection, and a large pair of kidney-shaped compound eyes located on either side, offering a wide field of vision. The head features biting and chewing mouthparts, including strong mandibles for cutting and crushing food, maxillary palps for holding food, a labrum (upper lip), and a labium (lower lip). Their chewing mouthparts enable them to consume a wide variety of food, while their glossy exoskeleton with sparse sensory hairs enhances mobility and protection, facilitating escape from predators. The head is connected to the thorax by a short neck, allowing some mobility and seamless integration with the body. The thorax of the cockroach bears two prominent longitudinal stripes on their dark thorax, likely for camouflage, and hardened forewings, known as tegmina or elytra, which cover the delicate broad membranous hindwings used for flight. The thorax also supports three pairs of segmented legs, each adapted for rapid movement, even in confined spaces where flight is not feasible. These legs are equipped with spines that provide a firm grip on surfaces and serve as a defensive mechanism, deterring predators and enhancing survival. The legs have claws and an arolium (a soft, hairy pad) between the claws that enhances grip on slippery surfaces. The cockroach abdomen is broad and segmented, composed of 10 visible segments in both sexes. It houses vital organs like those of the digestive and reproductive systems and contains the majority of the respiratory spiracles. The abdomen terminates with a pair of sensitive cerci, thread-like projections equipped with mechanoreceptors that detect air movements, aiding in predator avoidance and food location. In males, the abdomen is slightly narrower and bears a pair of additional styles—slender, unsegmented appendages near the base of the cerci, absent in females, that aid in courtship and grasping the female during mating. Females possess specialised gonapophyses for reproduction and produce an ootheca, a hardened egg case that may be carried by the female for a period before being deposited in a safe location. The last abdominal segment in both sexes includes podical plates, triangular structures that protect the anal opening. The combination of speed, sensory adaptations, and defensive structures ensures their remarkable resilience and survival in diverse and often challenging habitats. Figure233.1.6.insects_image_004.jpg. Figure234.1.6.insects_image_005.jpg. Figure235.1.6.insects_image_006.jpg. Termites, such as the Eastern subterranean termite (Reticulitermes flavipes), are eusocial insects known for their complex colony-based structure with distinct castes: workers, soldiers, and reproductives (kings and queens, collectively known as alates), each fulfilling specialised roles. Also renowned for their ability to degrade a wide range of plant-based materials, including wood, paper, and even soil, termites play a crucial role in nutrient cycling while simultaneously posing a significant threat to wooden structures and crops. They exhibit soft, elongated, and cylindrical bodies with colours ranging from creamy white to dark brown, depending on the caste, with workers and soldiers typically being pale, while alates may be darker. Termite head morphology exhibits significant variation across castes; workers, the most abundant caste, primarily responsible for foraging, nest maintenance, and brood care, typically possess smaller heads. In contrast, soldiers, specialised for defence, often have larger heads equipped with powerful mandibles or frontal defences. Alates exhibit the most pronounced head variation. Their heads are larger and more elongated to accommodate well-developed flight muscles. Moreover, these larger heads are often sclerotised (hardened), offering enhanced protection during the vulnerable flight and dispersal phases. The heads feature short, straight antennae composed of bead-like segments, and strong mandibles adapted for various functions depending on the caste. Workers possess mandibles primarily for chewing and processing food. Soldiers often have enlarged mandibles for protection from predators and intruders. Alates, on the other hand, may have less pronounced jaw structures as their primary focus shifts towards reproduction and dispersal. Termites, being social insects that primarily live in enclosed environments, generally have a uniformly coloured broad and segmented thorax, as visual cues are less critical for their survival and interactions within the colony. All castes possess three pairs of segmented legs, which are typically short and adapted for efficient walking and navigation within confined spaces or the complex tunnel systems of the colony. Though simpler in structure, the legs are equipped with pulvilli for stability on uneven surfaces. Workers and soldiers are typically wingless, while alates possess two pairs of equal-sized, membranous wings, with minimal venation, enabling them to disperse and establish new colonies. These wings are typically shed shortly after the swarming flight, whether or not mating has occurred. This shedding allows the alates to focus on establishing a new colony and fulfilling their reproductive roles. They typically mate only once in their lifetime but with multiple partners, which is crucial for genetic diversity within the colony. Workers and soldiers lack wings, reflecting their roles in the colony. The abdomen of a termite is long and cylindrical, with ten visible segments housing critical digestive and reproductive organs. It is characterised by a relatively smooth and even outline, lacking pronounced constrictions that might be observed in other insects. It contains specialised structures such as spiracles for respiration and lacks the external sensory appendages, like cerci, seen in cockroaches. Instead, termites rely heavily on chemical communication using pheromones for coordination within the colony. In reproductive alates, the abdomen is slightly more robust to support egg-laying in females or sperm production in males. Queens have a significantly enlarged abdomen for high-volume egg production, a phenomenon known as physogastry, which can result in the queen's abdomen being several times the size of her thorax. The combination of caste-specific adaptations, chemical communication, and eusocial organisation ensures termites' efficiency in exploiting resources and maintaining colony survival, making them both ecologically significant and a considerable challenge in human environments. Finally, the order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) is recognised for its scaled wings, often adorned with vibrant colours and intricate patterns. Examples include the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), the Citrus butterfly (Papilio demodocus), also referred to as the Lime butterfly due to its preference for lime and other citrus plants, the Small White butterfly (Pieris rapae), and the Silk moth (Bombyx mori). Generally, a butterfly possesses fine sensory hairs across the whole body, a small, rounded head adorned with two long, slender, segmented antennae that taper to club-like tips, large, dark compound eyes, and an elongated proboscis designed for siphoning nectar, coiled beneath the head when not in use. The mandibles, labium, and labrum are poorly developed and hardly used. Figure236.1.6.insects_image_007.jpg. The compact thorax, essential for the butterfly’s iconic flight, supports a smooth body, three pairs of slender legs segmented into coxa, femur, tibia, and tarsus, with claws at the tips and pulvilli—small adhesive pads on the feet that aid in gripping surfaces. In some species, the front legs are reduced in size and specialised for tasting potential food sources or host plants. The thorax also bears two pairs of large, colourful, and intricately scaled wings, often vividly patterned, which are crucial for flight and thermoregulation. Butterflies exhibit a wide range of thorax patterns, often including intricate powdery scales that create stripes or other designs. These patterns can serve various functions, such as camouflage, thermoregulation, and species recognition. The elongated and segmented abdomen (typically 10 segments), often brightly coloured and delicate, tapers towards the end. It is covered with fine scales and houses the reproductive organs. Butterflies lack cerci and halteres, relying instead on their lightweight body, broad wings, and efficient flight muscles for stability and balance. • In pairs, use a hand lens to observe a housefly, cockroach, mosquito, termite, bee, and butterfly; paying specific attention to the following structures: • head (mouth parts, antennae, eyes, hair) • thorax (wings, halters, hairs, stripes, legs and the different segments) • abdomen • Create a suitable table and record observations; comparing each of the insects. • Draw the insects provided, label the structures listed above and annotate drawings to explain the functions of the structures. Assignment 2 {Construct a dichotomous key}. • In pairs, construct a dichotomous key for any four of the insects listed above. • You can use a suitable graphical program to present the dichotomous key. Assignment 3 {Explore the useful and harmful effects of a housefly, cockroach, mosquito, bee, and butterfly}. Note: For the life cycles of each of the insects, only give duration of the whole cycle not the duration for each stage of the cycle. The housefly, which undergoes complete metamorphosis and has a life cycle of about 7–10 days, under favourable conditions, such as warm temperatures and abundant food, exhibits both useful and harmful effects. It plays an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter, contributing to nutrient recycling within ecosystems, and breaking down decaying substances in the environment. However, it is a major health hazard as it acts as a vector for numerous diseases, including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, trachoma, and food poisoning, by contaminating food, water, and surfaces with pathogens carried on its body and excreta. The cockroach, which undergoes incomplete metamorphosis and has a life cycle of about 3–6 months under favourable conditions, such as warm temperatures and high humidity, while primarily harmful, contributes to the ecosystem as a detritivore, breaking down organic waste, contributing to nutrient cycling in natural environments. Cockroaches pose significant health risks by contaminating food with bacteria such as Salmonella, spreading allergens that can trigger asthma, and dirtying environments with their faeces, especially when infestations are large. Additionally, they can harbour parasitic organisms, further exacerbating health concerns. Beyond their impact on hygiene, cockroaches are also destructive, damaging clothes, books, shoes, and furniture. The mosquito, which undergoes complete metamorphosis, a process typically lasting 7–14 days under favourable conditions such as warm temperatures and stagnant water sources, has a dual ecological role. Its larva serves as a vital food source for fish, amphibians, and other aquatic organisms, contributing to the balance of aquatic ecosystems. It contributes to pollination by feeding on nectar. However, its harmful effects far outweigh its benefits, as it is a primary vector for deadly diseases like elephantiasis and yellow fever (Aedes), malaria (female Anopheles), dengue fever (Culex), Zika virus, and chikungunya, causing significant global morbidity and mortality. The bee, which undergoes complete metamorphosis, typically lasting about 16 to 60 days, depending on the species, caste, and environmental conditions, is immensely beneficial to the environment and human life. Bees are critical pollinators for a wide range of crops and wild plants, playing a key role in the reproduction of a vast array of flowering plants, including many that provide us with essential food sources, thus maintaining biodiversity, ensuring food security, and supporting agricultural productivity. They also produce honey, beeswax, and propolis (a resinous substance collected by bees from tree buds and sap), which have significant economic, culinary, and medicinal value. However, bees can also be harmful in specific contexts. Honey is a widely consumed natural sweetener rich in carbohydrates, used in various culinary applications, from baking to beverages. It is renowned for its antimicrobial properties and is often utilised as a remedy for ailments such as coughs. Beeswax is a valuable resource in industries such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and candle-making, where it serves as a natural emulsifier and thickening agent, and is also used in products like varnish and shoe polish. Propolis is valued for its potential medicinal benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and is commonly found in supplements and natural remedies. Bee stings cause pain and swelling, and for individuals with bee sting allergies, they can trigger severe and potentially life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis. Additionally, aggressive swarming behaviour in certain situations can pose risks to humans and animals. Lastly, the butterfly, which undergoes complete metamorphosis over a process typically lasting 20–40 days under favourable conditions such as warm temperatures and an abundant food supply, is largely beneficial to ecosystems. Butterflies aid in pollination, contributing to the reproduction of various plant species, and serve as indicator species for environmental health, reflecting changes in biodiversity and climate. Their larvae, known as caterpillars, serve as a valuable food source for a wide range of birds, reptiles, and other animals, playing a crucial role in supporting food webs and maintaining ecological balance. Some caterpillars even feed on insects, helping to control pest populations. Additionally, silk threads are obtained from the cocoons of certain butterflies for making silk garments. Butterflies are also used as decorative elements due to their beautiful colour patterns, which find applications in the art industry. However, the caterpillar stage of a butterfly can be significantly destructive to vegetables, including crops such as cabbages, maize, millet, and sorghum, leading to substantial yield losses. Specifically, the larvae of the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris brassicae), commonly known as cabbageworms, are particularly harmful. These caterpillars feed voraciously on the leaves of cabbage and other brassicas, including broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, and mustard, causing extensive damage that can diminish the quality and quantity of the harvest. Furthermore, the powdery scales of butterflies may pose respiratory hazards when inhaled. Video157.Hexapoda.mp4. Assignment 4 {What are the different methods of controlling the harmful stages of a housefly, cockroach, mosquito, and butterfly}. Controlling the harmful stages of the housefly requires a combination of sanitation, physical, chemical, and biological methods. Effective sanitation involves proper disposal of organic waste, including human waste and promptly removing decaying organic matter, such as garbage and animal waste, to eliminate breeding sites. Physical methods include installing fine mesh screens and fly traps, while chemical control involves using residual sprays, aerosols, and bait laced with insecticides. Biological control methods, such as releasing parasitic wasps that target fly pupae, are also effective. For the cockroach, integrated pest management (IPM) is essential. Regular cleaning to remove food crumbs, grease, and water sources is the first step, alongside sealing potential entry points into structures such as cracks, crevices, and other hiding spots. Chemical control involves using gel baits, boric acid, and insecticides, while insect growth regulators (IGRs) inhibit cockroach development by disrupting their growth and reproductive processes. Natural predators like geckos and centipedes, as well as sticky traps, can also help reduce infestations. Combining these methods creates a comprehensive approach to managing cockroach populations effectively. Mosquito control prioritises the elimination or disruption of breeding sites, particularly stagnant water, through measures such as draining standing water, covering water containers, and/or applying a film of oil over the water surface to prevent oxygen reaching the mosquito larvae. Bushes around the homestead should also be cleared, as mosquitoes tend to rest on them and may breed nearby during the rainy season. Biological control methods include introducing larvivorous fish, such as Gambusia, into stagnant water bodies like ponds, as well as applying Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), a naturally occurring bacterium that effectively targets mosquito larvae while remaining safe for beneficial insects. To reduce adult mosquito populations and minimise bites, insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), wearing clothing that covers both legs and arms in the evening, and personal repellents are commonly used. Additionally, releasing sterilised male mosquitoes is an effective method to control reproduction, further helping to manage mosquito populations. For the butterfly, harmful stages like caterpillars (e.g., cabbage white butterfly larvae) can be managed by encouraging natural predators such as birds, parasitic wasps, and ladybirds. Biological control also involves spraying Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk), which is effective against butterfly larvae while being safe for beneficial insects. Crop rotation and intercropping with non-host plants disrupt the pest's life cycle, while manual removal of caterpillars from plants is an additional method in smaller agricultural setups. Butterfly control may also involve the use of netting to protect vulnerable plants or the application of specific insecticides in limited agricultural settings where they are considered a significant pest. • In pairs, research on the different methods of controlling the harmful stages of a housefly, cockroach, mosquito, and butterfly. Produce a presentation advising the class on how to control these populations;
