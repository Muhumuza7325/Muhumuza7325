Item 1 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: Mary’s 5-year-old baby frequently falls sick and has to visit the hospital regularly. The doctor told her that the frequent sickness is as a result of feeding. Mary feeds her baby on food nutrients; A and B plus food supplement containing mineral salts, fats and roughages. Mary is wondering what could be missing in her baby’s food. Task: Carry out investigations on the food samples A and B and use your findings to advise Mary accordingly.#Expected Response:#Aim: To investigate the nutrients, present in the food samples A and B.#Hypothesis: Frequent sickness of Mary’s child is due to absence of required nutrients in food samples A and B.#List of Apparatus, reagents, solutions and Materials used: Solutions A and B. Iodine solution. Benedict’s solution. Dilute hydrochloric acid. Dilute Sodium hydroxide. DCPIP. Copper (II) sulphate solution. Heat source. Test tubes and droppers.#Procedure, Observations/data presentation:#Procedure: Sample: Observations: Deductions#To 1cm³ of food sample, add 2 drops of Iodine solution #A: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns black/blue-black: Starch present#B: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns black/blue-black: Starch present#To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of Benedict’s solution and boil#A: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Reducing sugars absent#B: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Reducing sugars absent #To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of dil HCl(aq) and boil, cool under tap water. Add 1cm³ dil NaOH(aq) followed by 2cm³ of Benedict’s solution and boil.#A: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns blue and the blue colour persists. Non reducing sugars absent#B: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Non reducing sugars absent#To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of dil NaOH(aq) followed by 4 drops of CuSO₄(aq) #A: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Proteins absent#B: Cloudy/turbid/milky solution turns blue and then purple: Proteins present#To 1cm³ of DCPIP, add the food sample dropwise until in excess#A: Deep blue colour was discharged (if the cassava was very fresh from the garden): Vitamin C present. OR: Deep blue colour persists (if the cassava not very fresh e.g., from market): Vitamin C absent#B: Deep blue colour persists: Vitamin C absent#Conclusion / Nutrients present in the baby’s food are:#Option 1: Starch (carbohydrate), Proteins, and Vitamin C.#Option 2: Starch (carbohydrate), proteins.#Recommendations and Advice:#Option 1: The child’s food has all the required nutrients. The sickness is not due to the current food nutrients provided. The child may be sick due to other causes, hence take the child for further examination by medical personnel.#Option 2: The child’s food is lacking vitamin C, hence the frequent sickness is possibly deficiency of vitamin C. Provide the child with foods rich in Vitamin C e.g., oranges, mangoes, passion fruits etc., so as to boost the child’s immunity.
