[Assignment 1] {Explore the principle of the surface area to volume ratio}. The principle of the surface area to volume ratio is crucial in understanding how the size and shape of an organism or structure impacts its ability to exchange materials with its environment. As an object grows, its volume increases at a faster rate than its surface area, leading to a decrease in the surface area to volume ratio. This reduction limits the efficiency of processes such as diffusion and osmosis as the available surface area becomes relatively smaller in proportion to the volume. In biological systems, organisms or cells with a high surface area to volume ratio, such as small unicellular organisms, can exchange substances with their surroundings more efficiently. In contrast, larger organisms tend to develop specialised adaptations, such as the folding of surfaces in the lungs or the presence of villi in the intestines. These features increase the surface area available for processes like nutrient absorption, gas exchange, or heat regulation, compensating for the reduced surface area relative to their volume as they grow. For cubes with side lengths of 1cm, 2cm, and 3cm, the surface areas are 6cm², 24cm², and 54cm², respectively, while their volumes are 1cm³, 8cm³, and 27cm³. As the cube size increases, the volume grows faster than the surface area, highlighting the decreasing surface area to volume ratio, a key concept in understanding material exchange in biological systems. Video36.Surface_Area_to_Volume_Ratio.mp4. • In pairs, use cubes of different dimensions to calculate the surface area to volume ratios of the cubes, then discuss and explain the biological significance of calculated ratios. [Assignment 2] {Explore the need for a transport system, and identify the components involved in the transport system in mammals}. Smaller organisms that have large surface area to volume ratio carry out transport by simple diffusion. A transport system is essential for the survival of multicellular organisms because processes like diffusion, osmosis, and even active transport are insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of all cells across large distances within the body. As organisms grow larger, their surface area to volume ratio decreases, making it inefficient for essential substances like oxygen, nutrients, and waste products to be exchanged directly with the environment. A transport system, such as the circulatory system in animals or the vascular system in plants, ensures efficient distribution of these substances throughout the organism. It enables oxygen to reach tissues, nutrients to be delivered to cells, and waste products like carbon dioxide to be removed, maintaining homeostasis and supporting growth, development, and specialised functions, which would otherwise be limited by the constraints of cellular transport alone. Transport systems in animals and plants. In animals, the transport of materials is facilitated by a complex system that ensures efficient distribution of substances such as nutrients, gases, hormones, and waste products. To overcome the limitations of diffusion, which is insufficient for large, multicellular organisms, animals have evolved several key adaptations. Organs like the small intestine and lungs (or gills in aquatic animals) provide a large surface area for nutrient absorption and gas exchange without a significant increase in body volume. Animals also possess a circulatory system that transports substances such as oxygen, nutrients, and immune cells to tissues while removing waste products more efficiently than diffusion alone. In mammals, this system is closed, consisting of blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) and a heart that generates the force needed to circulate blood. The system is highly adaptable, with mechanisms like vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels to reduce blood flow) and vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels to increase blood flow) regulating blood flow based on metabolic needs, such as during exercise or rest. In contrast, plants do not rely on a circulatory system due to their lower oxygen requirements compared to animals. Instead, they have a network of continuous airspaces that allow gases to diffuse throughout their tissues, with stomata facilitating gas exchange between the plant and the atmosphere. Oxygen from the air diffuses through the stomata into these airspaces and then into plant cells, while oxygen dissolved in soil water can diffuse through root hairs. Additionally, plants have evolved vascular tissues—xylem and phloem—for transporting water, minerals, and nutrients. Xylem moves water and minerals from roots to leaves through processes like root pressure, capillary action, and transpiration. Phloem distributes sugars produced during photosynthesis to other parts of the plant through pressure-flow. Carbon dioxide produced during respiration is efficiently used in photosynthesis, reducing the need for complex transport systems like those in animals. Types of transport systems in animals. a) Closed circulatory system: A closed circulatory system, as seen in earthworms, fish, and mammals, features blood that is contained within vessels (arteries and veins). In this system, the heart pumps blood through the arteries to various tissues, and it returns to the heart via the veins. The arteries and veins are interconnected by capillaries, which are thin-walled vessels that facilitate the exchange of substances. This system is termed "closed" because the blood does not come into direct contact with the body's cells; instead, the cells are bathed in tissue fluid that extricates from the capillaries. Substances diffuse from the confined blood within the vessels into the tissue fluid and subsequently across the cell membranes to enter the cells. Figure125.transport_in_animals_image_125.jpg. A closed circulatory system ensures efficient blood distribution by maintaining it within vessels, allowing for precise regulation of nutrients, gases, and hormones. This system facilitates rapid blood flow, which leads to quick delivery of materials to tissues and effective removal of waste products. The high-pressure environment of the closed system enhances overall circulation efficiency. However, it requires a specialised heart to generate the necessary pressure and faces high resistance within the vessels, which increases the strain on the heart and demands more energy. Additionally, the complexity of maintaining a closed system with an intricate network of blood vessels adds to the organism's physiological demands. Despite these challenges, the closed circulatory system effectively supports the needs of complex organisms. Types of a closed circulatory system. Single circulatory system. A single circulatory system is characterised by blood flowing through the heart only once during each complete circuit of the body. In this system, blood from the body cells returns to the heart and is then pumped out to the gills or lungs for oxygenation before being distributed back to the body. This type of circulation involves a heart with two chambers: one atrium and one ventricle, as seen in fish and some amphibians. Drawing illustrating single circulation. Figure127.transport_in_animals_image_127.jpg. The advantages of this system include its simplicity and the efficiency of oxygenation in gills (or lungs in amphibians). However, it has notable drawbacks: blood moves relatively slowly, leading to a slower supply of materials to body tissues, and blood pressure is significantly reduced as it passes through the gill capillaries. This reduction in pressure can limit the efficiency of circulation and affect nutrient and oxygen delivery to tissues. Despite these limitations, the single circulatory system is effective for organisms with lower metabolic demands and supports their simpler physiological needs. Double circulatory system. In a double circulatory system, blood passes through the heart twice in each complete circuit, involving two distinct circulations: pulmonary and systemic. During pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated and returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein. In systemic circulation, oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body, and then returns to the right atrium through the vena cava. This system enables blood to be pumped at higher pressures, ensuring faster delivery of nutrients and gases to body organs. By maintaining two separate circuits, the double circulatory system ensures continuous and efficient blood flow throughout the body, with the heart functioning as a central pump to support complex and active organisms. Structure showing the flow of blood in a mammal. Figure132.transport_in_animals_image_132.jpg. Double circulation is divided into two types: incomplete double circulation and complete double circulation. Incomplete double circulation, found in amphibians like frogs, involves blood flowing through the heart twice per complete circuit but through a three-chambered heart (one atrium and one ventricle). The single ventricle handles both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, with mixing minimised by ridges within the ventricle. In contrast, complete double circulation, found in birds, reptiles, and mammals, features a four-chambered heart (two atria and two ventricles) that ensures blood flows through the heart twice per circuit. Here, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are completely separated by a septum, preventing any mixing. The advantages of double circulation include achieving higher blood pressures necessary for fast blood flow, resulting in more rapid circulation as blood is quickly returned to the heart for pumping. The complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood improves the efficiency of oxygen distribution, supporting the high metabolic rates of these animals. This system ensures that blood is directly pumped to where it is needed most, enhancing overall physiological efficiency. b) Open circulatory system: In an open circulatory system, found in molluscs and arthropods, the heart pumps blood into a short artery that leads to a large, open space known as the haemocoel. In the haemocoel, blood directly bathes the organism's cells, allowing nutrients and gases to diffuse out of the blood and across the cell membranes. Blood then returns to the heart through short veins. Figure126.transport_in_animals_image_126.jpg. The open circulatory system offers the advantage of easy diffusion of materials between blood and tissues due to the absence of vessel barriers and does not require a highly specialised heart, as blood flows through cavities with minimal resistance. However, it also has notable disadvantages: blood flows sluggishly, leading to a slow supply of nutrients and gases, operates at low pressure, and provides limited control over the distribution of materials. The lack of a continuous vessel network results in reduced circulation efficiency compared to closed systems. Despite these limitations, the open circulatory system effectively supports the metabolic needs of these organisms by facilitating direct exchange between blood and tissues. • In pairs, discuss what you already know about the components of your circulatory systems. • In groups, design a model, visual aid, animation or drama to illustrate blood flow/circulation in the human body and present to the class. [Assignment 3] {Explore how the structure of blood vessels is related to their function by comparing arteries, veins and capillaries}. Blood vessels are essential structures that transport blood throughout the body, consisting of arteries, veins, and capillaries. Both arteries and veins have three layers in their walls: the tunica intima (inner layer), the tunica media (middle muscular layer), and the tunica externa (outer layer). However, the tunica media, composed of smooth muscle and elastic tissue, is significantly thicker in arteries than in veins. This structural difference allows arteries to handle the higher pressure exerted by the heart when pumping blood, whereas veins operate under lower pressure and often rely on valves to prevent the backflow of blood. Arteries: Arteries transport blood from the heart to various tissues, gradually branching into smaller arterioles, which then connect to capillaries for efficient nutrient and gas exchange. Unlike veins, arteries lack valves (except at the base of the pulmonary artery and aorta) and are typically located deeper in the body to offer protection from injury. Arteries generally carry oxygenated blood, with two key exceptions: the pulmonary artery, which transports deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, and the umbilical arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood from the foetus to the placenta during pregnancy. Blood in arteries flows in rhythmic pulses, corresponding to the heartbeat, and this pulse can be felt at certain points in the body, such as the wrist or neck. The thick, elastic walls, particularly the muscular tunica media, allow arteries to withstand and adapt to the high pressure from the heart's pumping action. Their fibrous outer layer provides additional strength, while their narrow lumen maintains blood flow at high pressure. Note: In February 2024, the aorta, identified as the main artery, received official recognition as an independent organ in the human body. Capillaries: Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels, carrying both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. They have small lumens and lack valves, which contributes to the reduction of pressure as they connect to venules, which then converge to form veins. These vessels are essential for the exchange of materials between blood and cells. Due to their small diameter and high resistance, blood pressure decreases in capillaries, leading to slow, pulse-free blood flow. Capillaries are highly adapted for this function, featuring a large surface area and thin, permeable walls that enable rapid diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, and mineral salts into cells while facilitating the removal of waste products like carbon dioxide and urea. The slow blood flow further enhances the efficiency of material transfer. Veins: Veins are responsible for transporting blood from tissues back to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins operate under steady, lower pressure and primarily carry deoxygenated blood. Exceptions include the pulmonary vein, which transports oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, and the umbilical vein, which carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the foetus during pregnancy. Blood flow in veins is slow after the pressure drop in capillaries, but this sluggish movement is managed through several adaptations. Valves within veins prevent backflow and ensure unidirectional flow. Wide lumens reduce resistance, facilitating smooth blood flow at lower pressures. Additionally, the contraction of skeletal muscles during movement increases venous pressure, while inhaling lowers thoracic cavity pressure, aiding blood flow toward the heart. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, suited for lower pressure, and contain less elastic muscle. They are generally situated closer to the body surface. Figure450.transport_in_animals_image_001.jpg. Video38.Arteries_Veins_and_Capillaries.mp4. • In pairs, research on structures of arteries, capillaries and veins, and produce tables, models or diagrams to show how structure is related to function in each case. [Assignment 4] {Describe the structure of the heart and how it functions}. The mammalian heart: The mammalian heart pumps blood throughout the body and is encased in the pericardium, a double-layered sac with pericardial fluid between its layers. The pericardium’s primary function is to protect the heart and reduce friction as it beats, providing a lubricated environment for smooth cardiac movement. Composed of the cardiac muscle tissue, the heart contracts rapidly and is divided into four chambers: two upper atria (or auricles) and two lower ventricles. It is separated into left and right sections by a muscular septum, preventing the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Blood flows in a single direction due to valves that regulate the movement from the atria to the ventricles and then into the blood vessels. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary vein and pumps it to the left ventricle through the bicuspid (mitral) valve. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the vena cava and pumps it to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria because they must pump blood over greater distances; the left ventricle has a thicker wall than the right to manage the higher pressure of systemic circulation. Blood flows from the body into the right atrium, then to the right ventricle, and is pumped to the lungs via the pulmonary artery for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, moves to the left ventricle, and is pumped out to the body through the aorta. The coordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle ensures efficient blood flow and maintains circulation throughout the body. Longitudinal section of the heart. Figure133.transport_in_animals_image_133.jpg. Video39.Circulatory_System_and_Pathway_of_Blood_Through_the_Heart.mp4. Video68.How_the_heart_works.mp4. The cardiac cycle: The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that coordinates the heart's pumping and refilling with blood. It comprises two main phases: the filling of the heart with blood (diastole) and the pumping of blood (systole). During diastole, the cardiac muscles relax, allowing the atria to expand and fill with blood from the vena cava and pulmonary veins. As the atria fill, their walls contract, pushing blood into the ventricles through the open bicuspid (mitral) and tricuspid valves, while the semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) remain closed to prevent backflow. In systole, the ventricles contract, generating pressure that forces blood out of the heart into the aorta and pulmonary artery through the open semilunar valves. Simultaneously, the atria relax and expand to prepare for the next filling phase. The closure of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves against the high blood pressure in the ventricles prevents backflow into the atria, producing the characteristic "lub" sound of the heartbeat. After the ventricles expel blood, they relax and their pressure drops compared to the aorta and pulmonary artery. This pressure difference would cause backflow, but is prevented by the sudden closure of the semilunar valves, producing a second heart sound called "dub." The "lub-dub" sounds together form a single heartbeat. The contraction of the heart is initiated by the heart muscles themselves, making them myogenic, meaning rhythmic contraction arises from within the tissue. The heartbeat is regulated by pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) located in the right atrium. These cells generate electrical impulses that control the heart rate, modulated by nervous signals from the medulla oblongata of the brain. Figure451.transport_in_animals_image_002.jpg. On a cardiogram, the phases of the cardiac cycle are reflected in the graphical representation of the heart's electrical activity. The P wave corresponds to atrial depolarisation, which leads to atrial contraction and the filling of the ventricles during diastole. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarisation and contraction, driving blood ejection from the ventricles into the aorta and pulmonary artery during systole. Finally, the T wave indicates ventricular repolarisation, marking the end of systole and the start of the next diastole as the ventricles relax and prepare for the subsequent filling phase. These electrical events on the cardiogram align with the mechanical events of the cardiac cycle, offering a detailed view of the heart's rhythm and function. Figure452.transport_in_animals_image_003.jpg. Factors affecting the heart beat rate. Several factors influence heart rate, including hormonal levels, state of health, age, body size, and sex. Hormones such as adrenaline can increase heart rate in response to stress or physical exertion. Health conditions and diseases, such as fever from malaria, often elevate heart rate as the body works to combat illness and regulate temperature. Age affects heart rate, with infants and children typically having faster rates compared to adults due to their higher metabolic demands and smaller hearts. Body size is another factor, with smaller organisms generally having faster heart rates than larger ones, reflecting their higher metabolic rates. Sex differences also play a role, with females generally exhibiting a higher resting heart rate than males. Additionally, factors such as physical fitness, emotional state, and body temperature can influence heart rate. In normal adults at rest, the heart contracts about 70 to 72 times per minute, though this rate can vary based on the factors mentioned. Video40.The_Cardiac_Cycle.mp4. • In pairs, discuss the structure and function of the heart, referring to diagrams and a model. Share your thoughts in groups or whole class discussion. Draw and label the parts of a mammalian heart adding clear notes relating to function. [Assignment 5] {Explore the causes and prevention of diseases associated with the heart (high blood pressure, coronary heart disease and stroke)}. Blood pressure: Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels as it is pumped by the heart. It varies depending on the diameter of the blood vessels; narrower vessels experience higher blood pressure, while wider vessels have lower pressure. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can be caused by various factors. Common causes include the accumulation of fats and cholesterol in the blood vessels, which narrows their lumen and increases pressure. Other contributing factors include chronic kidney disease, hormonal disorders (such as hyperthyroidism and Cushing's syndrome), sleep apnoea (a condition characterised by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, which can cause fluctuations in blood pressure), stress, a sedentary lifestyle (a lifestyle with minimal physical activity, which can contribute to weight gain and cardiovascular problems), and excessive alcohol consumption. Genetic predisposition (inherited traits that increase the risk of developing high blood pressure) can also play a role. To manage high blood pressure, adopting a heart-healthy diet (low in salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol), engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are recommended. Medications may be prescribed if lifestyle changes are insufficient. Conversely, low blood pressure, or hypotension, can result from conditions such as dehydration, which reduces blood volume, or prolonged bed rest, which can weaken the cardiovascular system. Other medical conditions that may lead to low blood pressure include heart problems (such as bradycardia and heart failure), endocrine disorders (like Addison’s disease and hypothyroidism), severe infections (septicaemia), and nutritional deficiencies. Factors such as stress, anxiety, and sudden changes in posture can also impact blood pressure. Managing hypotension may involve increasing fluid intake, consuming a balanced diet with adequate salt, and avoiding sudden changes in posture. In some cases, medications and wearing compression stockings may be recommended. Regular monitoring and appropriate management of both high and low blood pressure are essential to prevent complications and ensure overall health. Additionally, ageing affects blood pressure regulation through changes in endothelial cells and increased arterial stiffness. These age-related changes can contribute to elevated blood pressure (hypertension) by impairing vessel elasticity and may also lead to lower blood pressure (hypotension) by reducing vascular responsiveness. Thus, ageing can result in both higher average blood pressure and less pronounced fluctuations. Heart diseases: Also known as cardiovascular diseases, heart diseases include conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as coronary artery disease, heart attacks, heart failure, arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases, and stroke. These conditions often arise from a mix of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, inactivity, and poor diet. Other risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic stress can further contribute to the development of heart diseases. Cardiovascular diseases can severely impact the quality of life, causing long-term health complications or death. Prevention and management strategies include lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medical interventions, such as blood pressure and cholesterol control, medications, and in some cases, surgical procedures, are essential in reducing risks and promoting cardiovascular health. Regular health check-ups and monitoring are also key to early detection and effective management. Coronary heart disease (CHD): Also known as coronary artery disease, CHD is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque—a mix of fat, cholesterol, and other substances. This plaque buildup, a process known as atherosclerosis, reduces blood flow to the heart, leading to chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and, in severe cases, heart attacks. The primary risk factors for CHD include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Symptoms can vary from mild discomfort to severe pain, and in some cases, CHD may be asymptomatic until a serious event occurs. Early diagnosis and management are crucial and typically involve lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly surgical interventions such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to restore proper blood flow and prevent complications. Strokes: Strokes are closely linked to heart health and can have serious, life-altering consequences. A stroke occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted, leading to a rapid loss of brain function. This interruption can be due to a blockage (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of a blood vessel (haemorrhagic stroke). Ischemic strokes, the most common type, result from a blood clot obstructing an artery that supplies blood to the brain. These clots can form within the brain’s blood vessels (referred to as a thrombus) or travel from another part of the body, such as the heart or arteries, to the brain (called an embolus). Conditions like atherosclerosis (plaque build-up in arteries) or atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) often contribute to clot formation. Haemorrhagic strokes, on the other hand, occur when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, leading to bleeding and pressure on surrounding brain tissues. Symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body, confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, and severe headache. Stroke symptoms often affect the opposite side of the body because each hemisphere of the brain controls the opposite side; for example, a stroke in the left hemisphere typically causes weakness or paralysis on the right side of the body. Prompt medical treatment is critical to minimise brain damage and improve recovery. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Preventive measures involve managing these risk factors through lifestyle changes, medications, and early recognition of stroke symptoms for immediate treatment.

Write a report on the causes and their prevention. [Assignment 6] {Identify the major functions of blood, and relate the functions to the components of blood}. [Assignment 7] {Explore the role of blood in the defence of the human body}. Blood, a connective tissue vital for maintaining homeostasis and overall health, consists of cells suspended in a fluid matrix called plasma, which contains water, proteins, electrolytes, and nutrients. Its cellular components include red blood cells (erythrocytes or red corpuscles), white blood cells (leucocytes or white corpuscles), and platelets (thrombocytes). An adult human typically has five to six litres of blood, making up about 10% of body weight. Blood performs several essential functions: it transports oxygen from the lungs to tissues and removes carbon dioxide; delivers nutrients from the ileum to cells and carries waste products like urea from the liver to the kidneys for excretion; transports hormones to target organs; distributes heat for temperature regulation; plays a key role in immune defence; regulates chemical levels such as glucose, electrolytes, and pH; and prevents excessive fluid loss by forming blood clots at injury sites. The red blood cells (erythrocytes or red corpuscles). Red blood cells are crucial for oxygen transport in the body and are the most numerous cells in the blood. Manufactured primarily in the red bone marrow in adults and in the liver in foetuses, red blood cells typically last about four months. After this period, they are broken down in the liver or spleen, where their components are recycled: iron is stored, and bile pigment is formed. Characterised by their biconcave disk shape, they provide a large surface area to volume ratio, facilitating efficient oxygen absorption. These cells contain haemoglobin molecules that bind and transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues, and carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs. Red blood cells lack nuclei and mitochondria, maximising space for haemoglobin and preventing the use of the oxygen they carry. Their thin cell membranes reduce the diffusion distance for gases, and they are flexible enough to navigate through capillaries. They are produced in greater numbers when ascending to high altitudes to compensate for lower oxygen levels, enhancing their capacity to transport oxygen effectively, which is particularly advantageous for athletes like Joshua Cheptegei who live and train in mountainous regions. Additionally, red blood cells have a key enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, which aids in the transport of carbon dioxide by facilitating its conversion to bicarbonate, a more soluble form. This ensures efficient gas exchange and maintains the blood's pH balance. Structure of the red blood cell. Figure134.transport_in_animals_image_134.jpg. The white blood cells (leucocytes or white corpuscles). White blood cells are essential for defending the body against infections and are primarily produced in the white bone marrow of long bones, as well as in the spleen and lymphatic system. In the foetus, however, the liver is the primary site for blood cell production, with the bone marrow becoming the main production site after birth. Worn-out white blood cells are also sent to the liver for destruction. They are fewer in number than red blood cells but increase significantly during infections. White blood cells are unique in that they are amoeboid in shape, possess a nucleus even at maturity, and lack haemoglobin. They function through two main categories: phagocytes, which have a lobed nucleus and destroy pathogens by engulfing them through phagocytosis, and lymphocytes, which produce antibodies to neutralise specific pathogens. Additionally, white blood cells play a crucial role in the immune response by recognising and responding to foreign invaders, and their numbers can also rise in response to stress or inflammation. Their ability to increase during immune challenges and their diverse functions highlight their critical role in maintaining the body’s health and combating disease. Structure of a white blood cell. Figure135.transport_in_animals_image_135.jpg. Action of white blood cells on the foreign particles. White blood cells, are classified into two main categories: granulocytes and agranulocytes. Granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, which are characterised by the presence of cytoplasmic granules that can be stained with specific dyes for identification. Eosinophils combat parasitic infections and are involved in allergic reactions. Basophils release histamine and heparin, aiding in inflammation and the body's response to allergens. Neutrophils, the most abundant granulocytes, are crucial for phagocytosing bacteria and fungi. During phagocytosis, phagocytes extend pseudopodia (false feet) to engulf the foreign particle, forming a food vacuole. Within this vacuole, digestive enzymes break down the particle, allowing the white blood cell to absorb important nutrients and components, while waste products are expelled through the contractile vacuole. This mechanism not only neutralises and eliminates pathogens but also aids in the removal of cellular debris and dead cells, contributing to the overall cleanliness and health of tissues. Illustration of phagocytosis. Figure136.transport_in_animals_image_136.jpg. Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes, which lack the distinct granules found in granulocytes. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, both of which are essential for phagocytosing pathogens and debris. Macrophages ingest and digest foreign particles, while dendritic cells are crucial for antigen presentation, which stimulates other immune cells. Lymphocytes, comprising B-cells and T-cells, play a central role in adaptive immunity. T-cells directly attack infected or abnormal cells, whereas B-cells produce antibodies—specialised proteins that target and neutralise pathogens. There are four main types of antibodies, each with a distinct role: opsonins attach to the surface of foreign particles, marking them for easier recognition and engulfment by phagocytes, thereby enhancing their uptake; agglutinins cause foreign particles to clump together, preventing their invasion of tissues; lysins break down the outer coats of bacteria, leading to their destruction; and anti-toxins neutralise harmful toxins produced by pathogens. This antibody-mediated response is crucial for effectively targeting and eliminating infectious agents and maintaining overall health. The platelets (thrombocytes). Platelets are cell fragments formed from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow during red blood cell production. They are crucial for blood clotting, which is essential for preventing excessive blood loss and protecting the body from infection. Platelets are spherical, lack a nucleus and haemoglobin, and play a key role in clot formation. When blood vessels are injured, platelets aggregate and adhere to the wound site, releasing factors that initiate the clotting cascade. This process forms a clot that not only seals the wound but also serves as a barrier to prevent the entry of pathogens, facilitating healing. Blood clotting is vital for controlling bleeding, aiding in tissue repair, and defending against infections. The process of blood clotting: When blood is exposed to air due to a cut or wound. Platelets at the injury site release thromboplastin (thrombokinase), a chemical that, in the presence of calcium ions and vitamin K, converts prothrombin into the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin then catalyses the conversion of the soluble protein fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. The fibrin forms a mesh of fibres that trap blood cells and proteins, creating a clot. This clot dries and hardens to form a scab, effectively sealing the wound and preventing further bleeding while aiding in tissue repair. Summary of blood clotting. Figure137.transport_in_animals_image_137.jpg. Blood plasma. Blood plasma is the fluid component of blood, consisting of about 90% water and dissolved substances that perform vital functions for the body. It contains key proteins such as fibrinogen, which is essential for blood clotting, along with albumins that regulate osmotic pressure and globulins that are involved in immune responses and transport. Plasma also contains serum, a watery fluid that transports hormones from glands to target organs, nutrients from the digestive system to cells, carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation, and waste products like urea to the kidneys for excretion. Additionally, it distributes heat from muscles and the liver, ensuring temperature regulation, and transports salts to maintain electrolyte balance while carrying antibodies to fight infections and platelets to initiate blood clotting at injury sites.

[Assignment 8] {Explore the process of the formation of lymph and its flow around the body}. As blood flows from arterioles into capillaries, the pressure within the capillaries forces small molecules like nutrients and the fluid portion of blood to exit the capillaries and enter the intercellular spaces, leaving behind larger molecules like proteins in the plasma. This fluid, once outside the capillaries, is no longer referred to as blood but as tissue fluid. Tissue fluid surrounds the cells, providing them with essential substances such as glucose and oxygen while collecting their waste products like carbon dioxide and urea. Some of the tissue fluid re-enters the capillaries, where it contributes to maintaining blood volume and pressure, while the rest is drained into narrow lymphatic vessels. As it moves through these vessels, it becomes lymph. Lymph is therefore essentially tissue fluid that has entered the lymphatic vessels and is then filtered through lymph nodes, which remove pathogens and debris before the lymph re-enters the bloodstream. This process is crucial for maintaining fluid balance, facilitating immune responses, and ensuring efficient waste removal from tissues. [Assignment 9] {Explore the function of the lymphatic system in maintaining a healthy body}. The lymphatic system is an integral part of the vascular system, forming a secondary circulation that is vital for fluid balance, immune response, and nutrient absorption. As tissue fluid exits blood capillaries and enters the lymphatic system, it becomes lymph, which is transported through lymph vessels. These vessels, similar to veins but with more valves, rely on surrounding muscle contractions to facilitate lymph movement. The lymphatic vessels' porous walls permit the entry of cells, waste products, and bacteria, which are then filtered out by lymph nodes before lymph rejoins the bloodstream via the thoracic ducts. The right thoracic duct drains lymph from the right side of the body, while the left thoracic duct handles the left side and also connects to the lacteals in the ileum, which absorb dietary fats. The lymphatic system's crucial role in maintaining fluid balance, defending against disease, and managing nutrient distribution is achieved through several key functions. It transports fatty acids and glycerol from the ileum to the heart, integrating them into the bloodstream. The system also carries excretory substances from tissues to the bloodstream, ensuring waste removal. White blood cells produced by the lymphatic system are essential for immune defence, while the system filters out bacteria and other pathogens before they can enter the bloodstream. Additionally, the lymphatic system transports hormones from glands to various parts of the body, contributing to overall health and physiological regulation. Health conditions associated with the lymphatic system primarily involve issues with drainage and immune functions. One common condition is lymphedema, where lymph fluid accumulates in tissues due to a blockage or damage to lymph vessels, causing swelling, often in the arms or legs. Another condition is lymphadenopathy, where lymph nodes become swollen, typically due to infections, inflammation, or cancer. Lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting lymphocytes, is a more serious condition that originates in the lymphatic system. Elephantiasis, often caused by parasitic infections like filariasis, leads to severe swelling of limbs or other body parts due to lymphatic blockage, resulting in abnormal enlargement. Mumps, a viral infection that affects the salivary glands, can also cause swelling of lymph nodes in the neck. These conditions highlight the critical role of the lymphatic system in fluid balance, immune defence, and fighting infections. The lymphatic and blood systems: The blood system, comprising arteries, veins, and capillaries, operates as a closed-loop network driven by the heart, transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste throughout the body. In contrast, the lymphatic system, with its lymph vessels and nodes, functions as a one-way network returning lymph to the bloodstream. Despite these differences, both systems possess valves to ensure unidirectional flow and prevent backflow. They rely on muscle contractions—whether from the heart in the blood system or surrounding skeletal muscles in the lymphatic system—to facilitate fluid movement. Additionally, both systems feature extensive networks of vessels that transport essential substances such as hormones, nutrients, and immune cells, underscoring their critical roles in maintaining bodily functions and overall health.

Blood groups: There are four main blood groups: A, B, AB, and O. Situations such as accidents, severe illnesses like malaria, surgical operations, and childbirth can lead to significant blood loss, necessitating blood transfusions. In such cases, blood is donated to a blood bank, where it is safely processed for transfusion. The person donating blood is known as the donor, while the recipient is the individual receiving the blood. For a transfusion to be successful, it is crucial to match the blood type of the donor with that of the recipient. Incompatible blood transfusions can lead to a dangerous reaction where red blood cells agglutinate, or clump together, causing blood clots. This reaction occurs because of the presence of specific proteins called antigens on the surface of red blood cells, which can interact with matching antibodies in the recipient’s blood. Antigens are foreign substances that provoke an immune response, while antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight off these foreign invaders. Blood groups are determined by the specific antigens present on the surface of red blood cells. Individuals with antigen A on their red blood cells belong to blood group A, while those with antigen B belong to blood group B. Blood group AB has both antigens A and B, whereas blood group O has neither antigen. Each blood group produces specific antibodies that react against the antigens not present on the individual's own red blood cells. For instance, blood group A produces anti-B antibodies, meaning it will react against blood group B, which has antigen B. This incompatibility can cause the red blood cells to agglutinate, or clump together, during transfusions. To prevent such reactions, blood tests are performed to ensure compatibility between donor and recipient blood types. Blood group AB is known as the universal recipient because it has no antibodies against A or B antigens, allowing it to accept blood from all groups. Conversely, blood group O, which has no antigens, is the universal donor, as its blood can be given to any other group without causing an adverse reaction. “Rhesus factor” system. Rhesus factor, a protein (antigen) found on the cell membranes of red blood cells, plays a crucial role in blood compatibility. Individuals with this factor are termed Rhesus positive (Rh+), while those without it are Rhesus negative (Rh-). The Rhesus factor was named after the Rhesus monkey, in which it was first discovered. A Rhesus positive individual can receive blood from both Rh+ and Rh- donors without adverse reactions. However, a Rhesus negative person can only safely receive blood from Rh- donors. If an Rh- individual receives Rh+ blood, their body will produce antibodies against the Rhesus factor, which can cause agglutination in future transfusions of Rh+ blood. This principle also applies to pregnancy. An Rh- woman can carry an Rh- foetus successfully but faces complications if carrying an Rh+ foetus, as her blood may produce antibodies against the Rhesus factor during the first pregnancy. These antibodies can then attack the Rh+ red blood cells in subsequent pregnancies, leading to potential complications. During blood transfusions, both the ABO blood group system and the Rhesus factor are considered to ensure compatibility. For instance, a person with blood group A Rh+ can receive blood from donors with A Rh+, A Rh-, O Rh+, or O Rh- blood types. Figure454.transport_in_animals_image_005.jpg.

Immunity is the ability of an organism to recognise and defend itself against harmful pathogens and diseases. This capability relies on the immune response, which identifies foreign particles such as antigens, bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens. Once detected, the immune system triggers a defensive reaction, releasing chemicals to target and destroy these invaders. This response involves white blood cells, which directly attack pathogens, and antibodies produced by these cells, which specifically bind to and facilitate the removal of the foreign particles. Types of immunity: Immunity is divided into two primary types: inborn (innate) immunity and acquired immunity. Inborn immunity is the natural resistance to diseases present from birth. Acquired immunity develops over an individual's lifetime and is further categorized into natural and artificial types. Natural acquired immunity includes natural active immunity, where the body generates its own antibodies after exposure to a disease, such as recovering from the flu, leading to long-term resistance to future infections. Natural passive immunity involves the temporary acquisition of antibodies from another individual, such as a newborn receiving antibodies through breastfeeding. Artificial acquired immunity encompasses artificial active immunity, achieved through vaccination with weakened or inactivated pathogens that stimulate the body to produce its own antibodies and build immunity. Artificial passive immunity involves the direct injection of antibodies into an individual, providing immediate but short-term protection without stimulating the body to produce its own antibodies. Effect of infections on the body’s immunity: An individual’s immunity can be reduced by infections such as HIV, certain types of cancer, malnutrition, viral hepatitis, some medical treatments. These infections invade the immune system and weaken its ability to detect and destroy pathogens. For example, HIV which causes AIDS is an acquired viral infection that destroys important white blood cells and weakens the immune system. Therefore, people living with HIV/AIDS can become seriously ill with infections that most people can fight against. These infections are called opportunistic infections because they take advantage of the weak immune systems. Other infections which can weaken the immunity include; flu virus, measles, etc. The immune system can also be weakened by smoking, taking alcohol and poor nutrition.
