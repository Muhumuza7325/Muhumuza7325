[Assignment 1] {Explore the need to remove unwanted substances from the bodies of living organisms}. Note: Excretion (the removal of metabolic waste from the body) takes place in all living organisms, including lower organisms and plants. Metabolism refers to the sum of all chemical reactions occurring within a living organism to maintain life, involving the transformation of energy and matter. It is classified into two types: anabolism, which involves building complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy (e.g., protein synthesis), and catabolism, which involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy (e.g., cellular respiration). As organisms carry out these essential metabolic activities, they produce waste products, which must be efficiently removed to maintain the organism’s internal balance and ensure survival. These waste products are divided into two groups: a) Nitrogenous excretory products: These are excretory products, which contain the element nitrogen. They include ammonia, urea and uric acid. Ammonia is a highly toxic nitrogenous waste that requires a significant amount of water for its elimination, with the water diluting the ammonia, reducing its toxicity to the body during excretion. It is highly soluble in water, which means it requires less energy to be excreted compared to other nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia is excreted by organisms living in environments with abundant water, such as freshwater, where the excess water allows them to efficiently dilute and eliminate this toxic waste. Such organisms include bony fish, protozoans, and amphibians when they are in aquatic environments. Urea is a less toxic nitrogenous waste compared to ammonia and requires less water for excretion, but it demands more energy due to its lower solubility in water. It is typically excreted in the form of urine, a mixture of urea, salts, and water. Terrestrial organisms with easy access to water and marine organisms excrete urea. Examples include terrestrial mammals, amphibians on land, and marine vertebrates such as cartilaginous fish. Some of these organisms, including humans, also produce ammonia as a by-product of protein metabolism in the liver. While humans primarily excrete urea for water conservation, small amounts of ammonia are released in urine, particularly during periods of high-water intake or rapid protein breakdown, as it is a by-product of amino acid metabolism. This occurs when the body can effectively manage ammonia's toxicity and has sufficient water available to dilute it. Uric acid is a less toxic nitrogenous waste compared to urea and requires no water for its elimination. It is insoluble in water and is excreted as a paste or solid, which minimises water loss. This makes it particularly advantageous for animals living in arid environments with limited access to water. However, excreting uric acid demands a significant amount of energy due to its insolubility in water. Animals that excrete uric acid include birds, reptiles, insects, and desert-dwelling animals. These organisms conserve water effectively since uric acid is excreted without the need for large amounts of water. Certain mammals, including humans, also excrete uric acid as a minor waste product, typically resulting from the breakdown of purines in the body. In humans, excessive accumulation of uric acid can lead to conditions like gout or kidney stones, demonstrating the balance required in its management. b) Non-nitrogenous excretory products: These are waste substances that do not contain nitrogen and are the result of various metabolic processes. Examples include CO₂, produced during cellular respiration and exhaled by animals or released through stomata in plants; H₂O, formed as a by-product of metabolic reactions and excreted via urination, sweating, or transpiration; O₂, which is released by plants during photosynthesis; and salts, such as sodium chloride, which are excreted to maintain osmotic balance, especially in marine and terrestrial organisms. The efficient removal of these waste products of metabolism is crucial for maintaining homeostasis, which in turn supports overall health and functionality. Note: While both processes help maintain homeostasis—the regulation of internal body conditions (the blood sugar level, salt level, water level, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, etc) to sustain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions, excretion removes metabolic waste from the body, whereas egestion eliminates unused ingested materials. Excretion is also different from secretion, which is the production of useful substances such as hormones, mucus, digestive juices, etc., by the cell. In particular, excretion contributes to osmoregulation—the regulation of water and solutes (such as salts) within the body, a crucial aspect of homeostasis. Most metabolic waste products are toxic when allowed to accumulate in the body, and their buildup disrupts normal metabolic functions. For instance, in animals, carbon dioxide, a by-product of respiration, must be expelled to prevent acidification of the blood, while nitrogenous wastes, such as ammonia, urea, or uric acid, resulting from protein metabolism, are excreted to prevent damage to tissues. Similarly, plants remove oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis, during periods of low photosynthetic activity to maintain balance. The processes of excretion, such as sweating, urination, and breathing in animals or transpiration in plants, are vital to homeostasis, enabling organisms to regulate their internal environments, support efficient biochemical reactions, and adapt to changing external conditions. The interconnected roles of excretion and homeostasis are vital to the survival of organisms. Without these processes, the accumulation of toxic substances and imbalances in water and solutes could disrupt physiological stability, leading to toxicity, cellular damage, organ failure, and ultimately death, highlighting the critical nature of these processes for survival. Unlike higher animals with specialised excretory systems, plants do not require specialised excretory organs due to their unique metabolic processes and efficient waste management. Their ability to store excess proteins, coupled with their lower metabolic rate, results in the accumulation of less waste compared to animals. Additionally, plants synthesise their organic food substances according to their needs, preventing the production of excess materials. Instead of nitrogenous wastes, plants primarily produce non-nitrogenous wastes, such as CO₂, which are less toxic. Some plant wastes, like organic acids, are stored in specific parts like leaves and fruits and are eliminated when these parts fall off. Furthermore, certain plant wastes, such as CO₂ produced during respiration, are reused in vital processes like photosynthesis. Similarly, simple organisms such as amoeba lack specialised excretory systems, relying on passive processes like osmosis and structures such as contractile vacuoles, to regulate water balance and remove waste products across their semi-permeable cell membrane. • In pairs, discuss the waste products that organisms need to excrete, and the implications for living cells if they were not able to remove them. Share conclusions in whole class discussion. • Distinguish between waste products and undigested waste (faeces). [Assignment 2] {Explore the process of excretion in humans, including the loss of waste products in sweat, urine and through breathing}. Excretion in humans is a vital biological process for removing metabolic waste products, maintaining internal balance, and preventing the accumulation of harmful substances. Specialised excretory organs (such as the liver, skin, lungs and kidneys) perform distinct roles in eliminating different wastes. The liver is a large, reddish-brown organ with a smooth, firm texture divided into lobes. The skin is a smooth, flexible organ, often covered with hair, containing sweat glands in the dermis. The lungs are spongy, pinkish organs located in the chest, with a soft texture and divided into lobes. The kidneys are bean-shaped, with a smooth, reddish-brown surface and a firm texture, located in the lower abdomen near the spine. • In groups, examine a dissected mammal or a diagram/video of one. Observe and identify the organs associated with excretion and record your observations. While not directly involved in excretion, the liver plays a crucial role in the process by breaking down toxins, drugs, and waste products from the bloodstream. It also metabolises alcohol and other chemicals, converting them into less toxic substances that can be excreted from the body. The liver converts ammonia, a toxic by-product of protein metabolism, into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Additionally, it also processes old red blood cells, breaking down haemoglobin into bilirubin, which is excreted in bile (for more details about the excretory roles of the liver, refer to chapter 3.3, nutrition in mammals and the next chapter). The skin plays a crucial dual role in excretion and temperature regulation through sweat production. Figure304.excretion_in_animals_304.jpg. Sweat is produced in sweat glands located in the dermis of the skin. These glands filter blood plasma, extracting excess water, salts (mainly sodium chloride), and small amounts of metabolic wastes such as urea—components that make up sweat. Sweat production is triggered by several factors, such as an increase in body temperature, physical exertion, stress, or exposure to heat. When the body’s temperature rises, thermoreceptors in the skin and the brain (specifically the hypothalamus) detect the change. The hypothalamus then signals the sweat glands to begin sweat production via the autonomic nervous system. Stress can also activate the sympathetic nervous system, prompting sweat production even without a temperature increase. Once produced, sweat is transported through sweat ducts and expelled through sweat pores onto the skin's surface. As sweat evaporates, it takes heat away from the body, cooling it down (refer to the cooling effect of evaporation in chapter 1.3 of Chemistry, States and changes of states of matter). Therefore, sweat is vital for eliminating waste and maintaining body temperature (thermoregulation), essential for the proper functioning of enzymes and metabolic processes (refer to the effect of temperature on enzyme activity in chapter 3.3 of Biology, Nutrition in mammals). However, if sweat accumulates on the skin's surface, it may cause discomfort, skin irritation, or dehydration. This occurs because sweat is primarily composed of water and salts, and when it accumulates without evaporating, it can lead to a build-up of salt on the skin. The salt can dry out the skin, causing irritation. Additionally, the constant presence of moisture can soften the skin and make it more prone to friction, which can lead to chafing or rashes. Furthermore, excessive sweating without proper fluid intake can lead to dehydration as the body loses essential fluids and electrolytes through sweat. To prevent these effects, the body works to regulate the volume of sweat produced, and proper hydration is essential for maintaining sweat function. Note that sweat itself is mostly odourless. The characteristic body odour that often accompanies sweating is due to the action of bacteria on sweat components, particularly in areas like the armpits. Bacteria break down sweat, producing compounds that cause the unpleasant smell. Factors such as diet, stress, hormonal changes, and certain medical conditions can influence the amount and type of sweat produced, further affecting body odour. To reduce body odour, regular bathing with soap is essential, as it removes sweat, dead skin cells, and bacteria, minimising the buildup of odour-causing compounds. Maintaining proper hygiene also helps prevent skin irritation and reduces the risk of infections, contributing to overall skin health. Additionally, incorporating deodorants or antiperspirants after bathing can further enhance odour control, as these products either mask odours or reduce sweat production, providing an extra layer of protection against body odour throughout the day. Overall, practicing good hygiene is crucial for controlling body odour and ensuring personal well-being. Video57.Why_do_we_sweat.mp4. • In pairs, research, discuss, and share conclusions relating to why a build-up of sweat can become smelly and the importance of hygiene. The lungs play a key role in eliminating carbon dioxide and water vapour, the by-products of cellular respiration, during exhalation. Note that CO₂ is transported in the blood as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻), and when it reaches the lungs, it is converted back into gas form and expelled through exhalation. Blood pH is closely related to the levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the body. The removal of CO₂ from the body aids in increasing blood pH, ensuring the pH remains within the optimal range (around 7.35–7.45) for metabolic functions, as discussed in more detail below. [Assignment 3] {Explore and explain how and why the human body reacts to raised levels of CO₂}. The human body responds to raised levels of CO₂ through a complex set of physiological mechanisms aimed at restoring normal levels of this gas in the blood. CO₂ is as a by-product of cellular respiration and is normally transported in the blood as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻), but when its concentration in the blood rises—either due to increased production (such as during exercise) or impaired removal (such as in cases of lung disease or high-altitude environments or when holding one's breath)—the body detects this change through specialised chemoreceptors. These chemoreceptors, located in the medulla of the brainstem and in the carotid and aortic bodies, are sensitive to the pH of the blood, which becomes more acidic as CO₂ levels increase. When CO₂ accumulates, it reacts with water in the blood to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which quickly dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) and hydrogen ions (H⁺). The concentration of hydrogen ions affects the pH of the blood—higher concentrations of H⁺ lead to a lower (more acidic) pH, while lower concentrations result in a higher (more alkaline) pH. In response to the drop in pH, the chemoreceptors send signals to the respiratory centre in the medulla of the brain. The respiratory centre then sends instructions to the respiratory muscles to increase the rate and depth of breathing (hyperventilation). This helps expel excess CO₂ from the lungs and restore normal levels of CO₂ in the blood. At the same time, the heart rate may increase to ensure more efficient gas exchange in the lungs. These changes occur rapidly to mitigate the effects of acidosis, as a drop in pH can disrupt normal cellular function and enzymatic activity (refer to the effect of pH on enzyme activity in chapter 3.3 of Biology, Nutrition in mammals). When blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ions react with hydrogen ions (H⁺) to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which quickly dissociates into water (H₂O) and CO₂ gas. This conversion allows CO₂ to be expelled from the body during exhalation. The removal of CO₂ reduces the concentration of hydrogen ions, raising the pH back to a normal level, thus preventing the blood from becoming too acidic, ensuring the pH remains within the optimal range (around 7.35–7.45) for metabolic functions. Thus, the body’s ability to regulate CO₂ levels is essential for maintaining the proper pH balance in the blood, which is crucial for homeostasis and the proper functioning of enzymes and cellular processes in the body. Video58.Acid_Base_Balance.mp4. • In pairs, consider prior learning and experience of taking exercise to explain how and why CO₂ levels affect breathing rate. Share thinking with the whole class. Structure of urinary system: Figure299.excretion_in_animals_299.jpg. The urinary system is essential for maintaining the body’s fluid balance, filtering blood, and excreting waste products in the form of urine. The aorta carries oxygenated blood rich in nutrients to the kidneys, while the renal arteries, branching from the dorsal aorta, transport blood containing excretory products to the kidneys for filtration. Within the kidneys, nephrons filter the blood. The filtered blood is then returned to circulation via the renal veins, which empty into the posterior vena cava. Urine is transported from the kidneys to the urinary bladder through two narrow tubes called ureters, which arise from the hilum of each kidney. The urinary bladder, a thick-walled elastic sac, stores urine until it is ready to be expelled. The flow of urine is controlled by the sphincter muscles, which contract and relax as necessary. Finally, urine exits the body through the urethra, completing the process of waste elimination. The kidneys, part of the urinary system, are the primary organs responsible for excretion. They filter the blood, removing waste products such as excess salts, water, urea, creatinine, and other nitrogenous wastes, which are then excreted as urine. In addition to waste removal, the kidneys help regulate water balance by adjusting the volume and concentration of urine based on the body’s hydration level. This process is crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Structure of the kidney: Figure300.excretion_in_animals_300.jpg. The kidneys are solid, bean-shaped organs that occur in pairs in humans. They are reddish-brown in colour, enclosed within a transparent membrane, and located at the back of the abdominal cavity on either side of the spine. Each kidney is highly vascular, consisting of a dense network of capillaries and renal tubules held together by connective tissue. Structurally, the kidney has two main regions: the cortex and the medulla. The cortex, the darker outer region, houses Bowman’s capsules, which perform the ultrafiltration of blood, removing waste products and excess substances. The medulla, the lighter inner region, contains cone-shaped structures called pyramids, which facilitate the flow of filtered fluid into the kidney pelvis. The pelvis, located at the centre of the kidney, is the area where the ureter begins, allowing urine to flow out of the kidney. The kidneys perform three vital functions: excretion, by removing metabolic wastes such as urea and creatinine; osmoregulation, by maintaining the balance of water and electrolytes; and endocrine regulation, by secreting hormones like erythropoietin and renin, which are crucial for red blood cell production and blood pressure control, respectively. These functions are carried out by microscopic structural and functional units called nephrons, with each kidney containing approximately one million of them. Figure284.3.3.excretion_in_animals_image_001.jpg. Each nephron begins with the Bowman’s capsule, a cup-shaped structure located in the kidney cortex, which contains a dense network of capillaries called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is formed from the wider arteriole of the renal artery, known as the afferent arteriole, which brings blood into the nephron, while the narrower efferent arteriole carries filtered blood away, eventually joining other vessels to form the renal vein. The high blood pressure in the glomerulus—caused by the afferent arteriole being wider than the efferent arteriole—forces small molecules such as urea, glucose, salts, and water through a semi-permeable membrane into the Bowman’s capsule, a process known as ultra-filtration. The glomerulus is well adapted for this function due to its numerous capillaries, which provide a large surface area, and its semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of small molecules. The Bowman’s capsule efficiently collects the filtrate, aided by its cup-shaped structure, porous upper membrane, and sufficient volume for accommodating filtrate. The filtrate then flows into the proximal convoluted tubule, a highly coiled structure where reabsorption of useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, salts, and water occurs. This tubule is adapted for reabsorption through its thin membrane for diffusion, microvilli that increase surface area, and abundant mitochondria that supply energy for active transport. From the proximal tubule, the filtrate enters the loop of Henle, a U-shaped structure divided into descending and ascending limbs located in the kidney medulla. This loop creates a concentration gradient in the medullary tissue fluid, making it hypertonic compared to the filtrate. This gradient is crucial for water reabsorption, particularly in organisms like camels, which conserve water using their long loops of Henle. From the loop of Henle, the filtrate moves into the distal convoluted tubule, where further reabsorption of salts such as chloride ions and additional water occurs, leaving a concentrated liquid now called urine. The distal tubule also plays a role in the regulation of pH and ion balance by selectively reabsorbing or secreting hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The urine then flows into the collecting duct, which transports it to the kidney pelvis. The collecting duct is critical for water conservation as it allows further outward movement of water, regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH) depending on the body’s hydration levels. Overall, the nephron is intricately adapted for its roles in maintaining homeostasis. Its highly vascularised structure ensures efficient filtration, while its specialised adaptations, including thin membranes, microvilli, and a concentration gradient system, facilitate selective reabsorption and excretion. These functions enable the nephron to regulate fluid balance, remove metabolic wastes, and maintain electrolyte and pH homeostasis, ensuring the body’s internal environment remains stable. Video59.Excretory_System_and_the_Nephron.mp4. Summary: Urine formation takes place in the nephron and occurs in three main phases: ultra-filtration (pressure filtration), selective reabsorption, and secretion. Ultra-filtration begins in the glomerulus, where high blood pressure is generated due to the afferent arteriole being larger than the efferent arteriole. This pressure forces small molecules out of the blood capillaries into the Bowman’s capsule, forming the glomerular filtrate. Blood entering the renal artery contains proteins, blood cells, urea, water, salts, amino acids, and vitamins. However, proteins and blood cells are not filtered out due to their large size, which prevents them from passing through the walls of the glomerulus. The glomerular filtrate, consisting of small molecules like glucose, urea, water, salts, and vitamins, moves from the Bowman’s capsule into the proximal convoluted tubule, where selective reabsorption begins. Figure301.excretion_in_animals_301.jpg. Selective reabsorption occurs along different parts of the nephron to reclaim essential substances from the filtrate. In the proximal convoluted tubule, most food materials, including all glucose, vitamins, some salts like sodium chloride, and water, are reabsorbed into the blood capillaries through active transport and diffusion. In the loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed into the capillaries by osmosis as the filtrate descends the limb, increasing its concentration. In the thick ascending limb, salts such as sodium and potassium ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) are reabsorbed by active transport, reducing the concentration of the filtrate as it ascends. In the distal convoluted tubule, selective reabsorption of salts continues through diffusion. Finally, in the collecting duct, water is drawn out into the highly concentrated medulla tissue by osmosis. Secretion is the third phase, occurring primarily in the proximal convoluted tubule, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. During this phase, substances such as hydrogen ions (H⁺), potassium ions (K⁺), and certain drugs are actively secreted into the filtrate from the surrounding blood vessels. This process helps regulate the body's pH and electrolyte balance, as well as eliminate excess substances from the bloodstream. The filtrate, now concentrated as urine, flows into the ureter and is temporarily stored in the urinary bladder before excretion. This carefully regulated process ensures that the body retains essential substances while efficiently removing metabolic waste and maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. Video60.How_is_urine_produced_in_the_body.mp4. • In groups, research the functions and processes that take place in the kidneys, and create a simulation explaining the processes of ultrafiltration and re-absorption. [Assignment 4] {Explore the need for tests to determine the presence of glucose and protein in urine, and explain the significance of the tests}. Blood and urine differ in their composition due to selective filtration and reabsorption processes in the kidneys. Under normal conditions, proteins and glucose are present in blood but absent in urine; proteins cannot pass through the filtration barrier of the glomerulus due to their large molecular size, while glucose is reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate back into the bloodstream. Urea, a waste product of protein metabolism, is more concentrated in urine than in blood as it is filtered out and not reabsorbed. Water is typically more abundant in urine than in blood, as it serves to dissolve and excrete urea, although its relative amount varies depending on the body's hydration level, solute concentration, temperature, and activity. Salts, such as chloride and sodium ions, are often more concentrated in urine than in blood when in excess, as they are not fully reabsorbed and accumulate in urine for excretion. Urinalysis is a test that analyses the composition of urine, providing critical information about an individual's health. It typically includes physical examination parameters such as colour, clarity, and odour, along with chemical analysis through dipstick tests or advanced laboratory techniques that assess key components, including glucose, protein, pH, and the presence of blood cells in urine. Tests to determine the presence of glucose and protein in urine are essential for diagnosing and monitoring various health conditions. In the school laboratory setting, utilise Benedict's solution for a qualitative analysis of glucose in urine, and follow up with the Biuret test for protein detection, as covered in Chapter 3.3 of Biology, Nutrition in Mammals. These tests are significant because they provide early warning signs of metabolic or renal dysfunction, enabling timely intervention. By analysing urine composition, these tests bridge the understanding of how selective filtration and reabsorption processes in the kidneys maintain homeostasis and highlight deviations caused by underlying conditions. The presence of glucose in urine, a condition known as glycosuria, indicates that blood glucose levels have exceeded the renal threshold, often signalling conditions like diabetes mellitus. If untreated, it can lead to chronic kidney damage, cardiovascular complications, and impaired wound healing. Protein in urine, or proteinuria, can signify damage to the glomerular filtration barrier, commonly associated with kidney diseases, hypertension, infections, or nephrotic syndrome. Prolonged protein loss may result in swelling (oedema), malnutrition, and further kidney impairment, highlighting the importance of timely detection and management. Additionally, urinalysis can be used in pregnancy tests, as the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine indicates pregnancy, and it can help diagnose urinary tract infections (UTIs) by detecting the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase, which signal bacterial infection. • In groups, carry out experiments to detect glucose and protein in Urine. Research reasons for and consequences of these problems. [Assignment 5] {Identify the causes, symptoms and treatment of kidney failure}. Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, occurs when the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste products, toxins, and excess fluids from the blood, leading to a dangerous accumulation of these substances and disrupting the body’s overall balance. The causes are diverse, with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension being the most common; prolonged high blood sugar levels or blood pressure can damage the delicate blood vessels and filtering units of the kidneys, reducing their functionality. Acute causes include severe infections such as sepsis, dehydration from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea, or urinary obstructions caused by kidney stones, tumours, or enlarged prostates, which can prevent waste from leaving the body. Autoimmune diseases like lupus may lead to inflammation and scarring of kidney tissue, while long-term use of certain medications, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or certain antibiotics, can harm kidney cells. Direct physical injuries from accidents or trauma can also damage the kidneys by causing tissue rupture, internal bleeding, or impaired blood flow. Blunt force to the abdomen or back, such as in car accidents or falls, may lead to bruising, laceration, or compression, potentially resulting in acute kidney failure. Symptoms of kidney failure can vary but often include swelling (oedema) in the legs, feet, or face due to fluid retention, decreased or dark-coloured urine output, persistent fatigue from toxin buildup, and generalised itching caused by the accumulation of waste in the blood. Advanced stages can manifest as nausea, vomiting, confusion, and shortness of breath, while severe cases may result in chest pain due to fluid around the heart or lungs. Treatment depends heavily on addressing the underlying cause; for example, managing diabetes with insulin or blood sugar-lowering medications and controlling blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs can slow the progression of kidney damage. Dietary changes, such as limiting the intake of protein, potassium, sodium, and fluids, help reduce the workload on the kidneys. In cases where the kidneys lose most or all function, kidney replacement therapies like dialysis, which removes waste and excess fluids mechanically, or kidney transplantation, if possible, which restores function with a donor kidney, become necessary to sustain life. Early detection and intervention are critical in preventing irreversible damage. Video61.Kidney_disease_&_failure.mp4. • Visit a health facility, listen to a medic or carry out research to find out the causes, symptoms and treatment of kidney failure. Write a report. [Assignment 6] {Explore the need for proper disposal of human waste e.g., urine}. Human waste, which encompasses both urine and faeces, is an inevitable byproduct of bodily functions and plays a significant role in maintaining health and hygiene. Proper disposal and management of human waste are essential for public health, environmental sustainability, and sanitation. Urine, primarily composed of water, contains waste products such as urea, creatinine, and electrolytes that can become harmful if not managed correctly. Faeces, on the other hand, consist of undigested food, bacteria, and metabolic waste and can also pose serious health risks if not disposed of properly. Human urine can be repurposed in several beneficial ways, including its use as a nitrogen-rich fertiliser and as a pesticide in agriculture, promoting sustainable farming practices, or in biogas production when used in anaerobic digesters. As a fertiliser, urine supplies essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are vital for promoting plant growth and improving soil health. Additionally, certain compounds found in urine can act as natural pesticides, helping to deter pests and reduce the reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides, thereby promoting more sustainable farming practices. Urine recycling represents an innovative approach used in closed-loop systems, such as those employed by astronauts on space missions, where urine can be treated and purified to extract water, making it safe for drinking. This maximises resource efficiency in environments where water is scarce and highlights the potential of urine as a valuable resource in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings. Similarly, faeces can be recycled through processes such as composting or converting it into biogas through anaerobic digestion. Composting faeces, particularly when combined with carbon-rich materials like straw, can create nutrient-rich soil amendments that improve soil health and promote sustainable agriculture. Moreover, when faeces are treated in anaerobic digesters, they can produce biogas, a renewable energy source that can be used for cooking or heating. However, improper disposal of urine and faeces can contaminate soil and water sources, leading to the proliferation of pathogens and the spread of waterborne diseases. Inadequate waste disposal systems can result in the leaching of harmful substances into groundwater, posing significant risks to drinking water supplies and adversely affecting ecosystems. To manage human waste effectively, particularly in school environments, designated sanitation facilities should be utilised, and regular maintenance of these systems should be ensured. Additionally, education on proper waste disposal methods can foster a culture of hygiene and respect for the environment. By rethinking human waste management, we can contribute to a healthier environment and sustainable practices. • In pairs, research, discuss, and share conclusions relating to alternative ways that human urine can be used, and how to manage human wastes like urine for a healthy environment at school;
