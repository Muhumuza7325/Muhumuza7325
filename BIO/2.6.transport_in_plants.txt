Note: Cover the basic principles of diffusion, osmosis, and active transport ONLY. [Assignment 1] {Explore the importance and key methods of movement of materials into and out of cells}. Movement of materials in and out of the cell. Movement of substances depends on the permeability of the cell membrane or cell wall. Substances like nutrients and excretions move in and out of the cell by diffusion, osmosis, active transport, phagocytosis and pinocytosis. Diffusion. This is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, typically occurring in gases and liquids. This process happens due to the constant, random motion of molecules, which causes them to naturally spread out and fill the available space. In contrast to solids, where molecules are tightly packed and vibrate in fixed positions, molecules in gases and liquids have greater freedom to move. Diffusion takes place when there is a concentration gradient, meaning a difference in concentration between two regions, and continues until the molecules are evenly distributed, reaching equilibrium. Experiment to demonstrate diffusion in gases (refer to chemistry). To demonstrate diffusion in gases, the following experiment can be conducted using wet red litmus paper, cotton wool, a glass tube, ammonium solution, and a glass rod. First, several strips of wet red litmus paper are placed inside a glass tube by using a glass rod or wire to push them into position, ensuring they stick to the walls and are evenly spaced. One end of the glass tube is corked. A piece of cotton wool soaked in ammonium solution is then placed at the other end of the tube, which is also sealed with a cork. As ammonia gas is released from the cotton wool, it begins to diffuse along the length of the glass tube. The ammonia, being an alkaline gas, gradually turns the litmus paper strips blue, starting from the end closest to the cotton wool and progressing sequentially toward the other end. This colour change demonstrates the diffusion of ammonia gas from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration. Notably, if the experiment is repeated with a more dilute ammonium solution, the diffusion rate would be slower, as the concentration gradient would be reduced, resulting in slower movement of the ammonia gas through the tube. Experiment to demonstrate diffusion in liquids. To demonstrate diffusion in liquids, the following experiment can be performed using a glass beaker, potassium permanganate crystals, water, and a spatula. Begin by filling the beaker with about 50ml of water. Carefully place a few crystals of potassium permanganate at the bottom of the beaker using the spatula, ensuring they settle at the base. Leave the setup undisturbed for 30 to 40 minutes. After this time, you will observe the purple colour of the potassium permanganate gradually spreading from the bottom of the beaker upwards, eventually colouring all the water. This process illustrates that diffusion occurs in liquids, as the potassium permanganate molecules move from an area of higher concentration (the crystal at the bottom) to an area of lower concentration (the surrounding water), eventually becoming evenly distributed throughout the liquid. • In pairs, observe a tea bag in a clear glass container of still warm water for a period of five minutes, then discuss and explain your observations. Whole class discussion leads to understanding of the process of diffusion. Factors affecting the rate of diffusion: The rate of diffusion is influenced by several factors. A higher concentration gradient, or a greater difference in concentration between two regions, leads to faster diffusion, as molecules move more rapidly from areas of high to low concentration. Temperature also plays a significant role, as an increase in temperature raises the kinetic energy of molecules, speeding up their movement and the overall rate of diffusion. The size and density of molecules are important as well; smaller and lighter molecules diffuse more quickly, while larger or denser particles slow down diffusion. Distance is another factor; shorter distances between regions of differing concentration allow for quicker diffusion, as observed in thin structures like alveoli and intestinal villi, which facilitate faster molecular transport. Surface area also affects diffusion, with larger areas, such as the villi of the ileum, providing more space for molecules to diffuse and thus increasing the diffusion rate. Finally, the medium through which diffusion occurs is crucial—diffusion happens most rapidly in gases due to their lower density and the greater freedom of molecular movement, slower in liquids, and slowest in solids, where molecules are closely packed and more restricted. Types of diffusion: Diffusion can be categorised into two main types: simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion involves molecules or ions moving freely across the cell membrane without assistance, driven by a concentration gradient from areas of higher to lower concentration, and does not require energy. In contrast, facilitated diffusion requires specific protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane to help molecules or ions traverse the membrane, still moving down their concentration gradient but with the aid of these proteins. Both types of diffusion are crucial for various biological processes, such as the uptake of certain nutrients by plant root hairs, gas exchange in unicellular organisms like amoebas, and the absorption of some digested food e.g., simple sugars and amino acids into the bloodstream. Additionally, diffusion is essential for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs of mammals and gills of fish, as well as for the removal of metabolic waste products like urea from animal cells into the blood. Osmosis: This is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration across a selectively permeable membrane. Alternatively, osmosis can be described as the movement of water molecules from a dilute solution (low solute concentration) to a concentrated solution (high solute concentration) through a semi-permeable membrane. A semi-permeable membrane allows certain molecules or ions to pass through while preventing others, thereby controlling the flow of substances based on size, charge, or other properties. When two solutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane with small pores, water molecules continuously move from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution until equilibrium is reached. Figure448.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_001.jpg. Experiment to demonstrate osmosis in an artificial cell. To demonstrate osmosis using an artificial cell, a visking tubing (which acts as a semi-permeable membrane) is filled with sugar solution and sealed at one end, with the other end tied to a capillary tube. The tubing is then immersed in a beaker of water, with the capillary tube extending out of the beaker. Over time, the water (a dilute solution) passes through the visking tubing into the sugar solution (a concentrated solution) by osmosis. As a result, the volume of the sugar solution increases, causing the liquid level to rise in the capillary tube. This experiment demonstrates the movement of water molecules through a selectively permeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. Experiment to demonstrate osmosis in living tissues: 1) To demonstrate osmosis in living tissues, an experiment can be performed using raw potatoes. Three fresh Irish potatoes are peeled, and their ends are sliced flat, with the interiors scooped out to form cups. In one potato (A), sugar grains are placed in the cup, while another potato (B) is left empty as a control. A third potato is boiled to destroy the tissue, and sugar is also placed in its cup. All three potato cups are placed in petri dishes filled with water and left for 2-6 hours. After this time, the liquid level in the cup of potato A rises, indicating the formation of a sugar solution, and the water level in the petri dish decreases. In contrast, the cups in potato B and the boiled potato remain empty, with no change in the water levels. This shows that osmosis occurs in living tissues with intact, semi-permeable membranes, while boiled tissues lose their semi-permeability and cannot undergo osmosis. 2) To demonstrate osmosis in a living tissue, four potato cylinders are prepared using a cork borer, ensuring all are of equal length (8cm). Alternatively, strips of equal size can be cut from the potato. Three beakers are labelled 0.0M, 0.5M, and 1.0M, each representing different concentrations of sucrose solution. The 0.0M beaker is filled with distilled water, while the 0.5M and 1.0M beakers are filled with their respective sucrose solutions. A potato cylinder or strip is placed in each beaker, fully submerged, and left undisturbed for 12 to 24 hours. After this period, the cylinders are removed, dried, and measured for changes in length. Observations are also made regarding the firmness or flexibility of the cylinders. The cylinder in 0.0M is expected to increase in length and become firm due to water entering the cells via osmosis. The cylinder in 1.0M is likely to shrink and become soft, as water leaves the potato tissue, moving into the more concentrated sucrose solution. 3) To demonstrate osmosis using raw unshelled eggs, place one egg in each of three labelled beakers containing different solutions: distilled water (0.0M), a 0.5M sucrose solution, and a 1.0M sucrose solution. Ensure each egg is fully submerged and leave the beakers undisturbed for two to three days. After this period, observe and sketch the eggs in their respective solutions, noting any changes in size and appearance. The egg in the 0.0M beaker is expected to increase in volume as it absorbs water through osmosis, while the egg in the 1.0M beaker will likely shrink due to water loss. The egg in the 0.5M solution may show a more moderate change. Unshelled eggs are used because their semi-permeable membranes allow for observable osmosis, unlike shelled eggs. Terms used in osmosis: In osmosis, several key terms describe the behaviour of solutions. Osmotic pressure is the force exerted by a solution to draw water into itself. Osmotic potential refers to a solution's ability to exert osmotic pressure, with a higher osmotic potential indicating a greater capacity to attract water. Water potential reflects the overall concentration of water in a solution, where lower water potential indicates higher solute concentrations and greater osmotic pressure. Hypotonic solutions have less solute and more water, resulting in lower osmotic pressure and a less concentrated state. Isotonic solutions have equal concentrations of solutes and water, meaning there is no net movement of water between them. Hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration of solutes and less water, creating higher osmotic pressure and a more concentrated state. Osmosis and cells: Unlike plant cells, animal cells lack a rigid cell wall and only have a cell membrane, which is less resistant to changes in internal pressure. When red blood cells are placed in a dilute solution (hypotonic solution), such as distilled water, they swell and eventually burst, a process known as haemolysis. This occurs because water moves from the surrounding solution into the cells through the semi-permeable membrane. Figure117.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_117.jpg. Conversely, when red blood cells are placed in a more concentrated solution (hypertonic solution), such as a strong sugar solution, water moves out of the cells into the surrounding solution, causing the cells to shrink in a process called crenation. In an isotonic solution, where the concentration of solutes is equal inside and outside the cells, red blood cells neither gain nor lose water, maintaining their normal shape. Turgor refers to the process where a plant cell absorbs enough water to reach its maximum expansion. Turgor pressure is the force exerted on the cell wall as a result of the cytoplasm pushing outward due to water entering the cell vacuole and causing it to expand. Turgidity describes the state of a cell that has absorbed sufficient water and expanded to its fullest size. When a plant cell is placed in a dilute solution, such as water, water enters the cell through the semi-permeable cell membrane and wall by osmosis. This influx of water increases the volume of the cell sap, causing the vacuole to expand and the cytoplasm to press against the cell wall. The rigid cellulose cell wall provides structural support, preventing the cell from bursting despite the increasing internal pressure. Once the cytoplasm fully presses against the cell wall and no more water can be absorbed, the cell reaches full turgidity, and the force exerted on the cell wall is referred to as turgor pressure. Plasmolysis is the process where a plant cell loses water to its surrounding environment, leading to the shrinkage of the vacuole and a subsequent loss of contact between the cytoplasm and the cell wall. This typically occurs when a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, where the concentration of solutes outside the cell is higher than inside. As a result, water moves out of the cell sap through the semi-permeable membrane and cell wall, causing the vacuole to contract and the cytoplasm to pull away from the cell wall. The cell, in this condition, is described as flaccid or plasmolysed. A flaccid cell is characterised by the absence of turgor pressure due to the reduction in cell sap volume and loss of contact between the cytoplasm and the cell wall. Figure118.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_118.jpg. Experiment to demonstrate turgor and plasmolysis. In an experiment to demonstrate turgor and plasmolysis, four potato cylinders, each cut to 3cm using a cork borer, are placed in 4 beakers. Three of the four beakers are filled to ¾ of their volume: One with a 5% sucrose solution, another with a 50% sucrose solution, and the third one with pure water. The fourth beaker is left empty. To each beaker, a potato cylinder is then placed for one hour. After the time has elapsed, the cylinders are removed from the beakers, measured, and their textures observed. The cylinder in pure water increases in length and becomes tougher, indicating turgor as water enters the cells. The cylinder in the 5% sucrose solution shows no change, reflecting isotonic conditions where water movement is balanced. The cylinder in the 50% sucrose solution shrinks and becomes soft and flaccid due to water exiting the cells, demonstrating plasmolysis. The cylinder in the empty beaker also shrinks, showing the effect of water loss through evaporation. • In groups, use scientific process skills to design and carry out an experiment to show the effect of solutions of different concentrations on raw unshelled eggs and raw potatoes. Discuss and draw conclusions to explain your results. Individually write reports at the end of the experiment that include the following: title, question, prediction, materials, procedure, record / analysis of results and conclusion. In groups present your work to the rest of the class. Significance of osmosis in plants: Osmosis is crucial for plant function, enabling root hairs to absorb water from the soil as water moves from areas of higher concentration in the soil to lower concentrations in the root cells. This process supports water movement through the root cortex to the xylem, maintaining turgor pressure and structural support, particularly in non-woody plants. Osmosis also facilitates the opening and closing of stomata for gas exchange and is essential during germination, where it initiates water uptake to kickstart growth. Significance of osmosis in animals. Osmosis facilitates the movement of water into capillaries within the villi of the intestines, aiding nutrient absorption. In unicellular organisms, osmosis regulates water balance by managing the influx and efflux of water through the cell membrane. It also plays a key role in maintaining cellular hydration by controlling the movement of water between tissue fluids and cells. Additionally, osmosis is essential for the reabsorption of water in the kidney tubules, regulating blood volume and concentration. These processes are vital for maintaining overall fluid balance and homeostasis in animals. Active transport: Active transport involves the movement of molecules from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration, against the concentration gradient, and requires energy. This energy is derived from respiration, and any factor that impacts respiration, such as cyanides which inhibit ATP synthesis, also affects active transport. Other influencing factors include glucose concentration, temperature, oxygen levels, and pH. The process relies on carrier proteins embedded in the cell membrane. These carrier proteins bind to the molecules, transport them across the membrane, and release them on the inner side, ready to continue facilitating the movement of other molecules. Examples of active transport: Active transport plays a critical role in various biological processes. For instance, plant roots use active transport to uptake mineral salts from the soil, where these salts are present in lower concentrations. In the digestive system, active transport is crucial for absorbing food molecules like glucose from the ileum into the bloodstream. Plants living in saline environments, such as salt marshes, rely on active transport to accumulate salts in their cells, allowing water to enter through osmosis. Similarly, fish in salty seawater use active transport to take in salts, preventing excessive water loss. Additionally, active transport is essential for the selective reabsorption of glucose and minerals in the kidneys during urine formation. It also aids the movement of waste products from cells to the surrounding tissue fluid against a concentration gradient, ensuring that no waste accumulates within the cells. [Assignment 2] {Investigate the different ways in which materials move into, through, and out of cells}. Comparing diffusion, osmosis, and active transport in biological systems. Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport differ in terms of the direction of molecule movement, energy requirements, and their applications in biological systems. In diffusion, molecules move along the concentration gradient, from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration, and this process is passive, requiring no energy. Similarly, osmosis involves the movement of water molecules along their concentration gradient, also a passive process that requires no energy. Both diffusion and osmosis occur due to the natural tendency of molecules to spread out evenly. In contrast, active transport moves molecules against the concentration gradient, from lower to higher concentration, and this process is active, meaning it requires energy in the form of ATP. Active transport relies on membrane proteins to facilitate the movement of materials, such as ions (e.g., sodium or potassium), across cell membranes. Diffusion and osmosis are commonly used in processes like gas exchange in the lungs or water absorption in plant roots, while active transport is crucial for maintaining ion balances and nutrient uptake, such as the sodium-potassium pump in animal cells. Video29.Movement_into_and_out_of_cells.mp4. • In groups, discuss and research the meanings of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, as well as the circumstances in which each is involved in the entry and exit of substances to and from cells. Present conclusions in a comparison table. Pinocytosis and phagocytosis are essential cellular processes for material uptake in animal cells. Pinocytosis, or "cell-drinking," involves the cell membrane forming vesicles around extracellular fluid, allowing the cell to absorb liquids and dissolved substances. Phagocytosis, or "cell-eating," entails the engulfing of solid particles, where the cell membrane extends around the material to form a phagosome. This vesicle then merges with lysosomes for digestion, with nutrients absorbed into the cytoplasm and waste expelled. Both processes are energy-dependent and crucial for various functions: pinocytosis facilitates nutrient uptake and regulation of extracellular fluid, while phagocytosis is vital for feeding in amoebas, immune defence through pathogen destruction by white blood cells, and the removal of undigested materials in unicellular organisms. Additionally, phagocytosis maintains cellular health and homeostasis by clearing debris and pathogens. The necessity for transport systems in large higher organisms (vascular & circulatory systems). All living things need a continuous exchange of certain substances between their cells and the environment e.g., oxygen, food, materials carbon dioxide, waste products. In complex animals, most cells are located far from the surface, making simple processes like diffusion, osmosis, and active transport insufficient for meeting their needs. Therefore, specialised transport systems are required. In animals, materials such as respiratory gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), nitrogenous wastes (e.g., uric acid), and nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids) are transported, while in plants, these include oxygen, carbon dioxide, mineral elements, manufactured food, absorbed nutrients, vitamins, amino acids, and hormones like auxins. The medium of transport is water in plants and lower animals, and blood in vertebrates and some invertebrates like annelids and arthropods. Transport occurs through blood vessels or body cavities (coelom) in animals and through the xylem and phloem in plants. Circulation in animals requires energy from respiration to power the heart and muscle contractions, while in plants, transport relies on processes like transpiration and active transport. These systems ensure that all cells receive necessary materials and can efficiently remove waste. Transport in plants. Transport in plants involves the movement of water, salts, and organic molecules, such as manufactured food. The xylem plays a key role in this process, consisting of xylem vessels (vessel elements) and tracheids. Xylem vessels form from cylindrical cells arranged end to end, where the cytoplasm dies and the cross-walls disappear, leaving a hollow, dead tube. Through these vessels, water and mineral salts move from the roots, through the stems, and up to the leaves. The walls of xylem vessels are strengthened by lignin, which provides structural support to the soft tissues of roots, stems, and leaves, and prevents the collapse of vessels as sap pressure fluctuates. Structure of xylem vessel/vessel elements. Figure119.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_119.jpg. Tracheids are similar to xylem vessels but differ in a few key aspects. They are typically 5 or 6-sided in cross-section and, unlike xylem vessels, their tapering end walls are not open but are perforated by pits—tiny holes in their lignified walls that allow the passage of water. Even xylem vessels possess pits in their walls. Tracheids are considered more primitive and are predominantly found in gymnosperms, such as cypress trees. In these plants, tracheids help control transpiration, as water moves more slowly through them compared to xylem vessels, which limits water loss and regulates the flow. Figure120.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_120.jpg. Characteristics of xylem tubes. Xylem tubes are composed of dead, hollow cells with lignified walls that provide structural support to the plant. These tubes lack protein filaments and cytoplasm, which allows for the efficient transport of water and mineral salts. The movement of these materials occurs in one direction, from the roots to the leaves, ensuring a continuous supply of water and nutrients essential for plant growth and functioning. Types of thickenings in the xylem vessels/tissues. Xylem vessels exhibit different types of thickenings that provide structural support and prevent collapse under pressure. These include annular lignification, where lignin forms ring-like structures along the vessel walls; spiral lignification, characterised by lignin being deposited in a spiral pattern; and reticulate lignification, where lignin creates a network or mesh-like pattern. Phloem tissue: This consists of sieve tubes and companion cells. The sieve tubes are formed from cylindrical cells arranged end to end, and unlike xylem vessels, their cross-walls do not disappear but develop perforations, forming sieve plates. The protoplast of sieve tube elements remains living, although the nucleus disintegrates during cell differentiation. Each sieve tube is closely associated with companion cells, which are complete cells responsible for regulating the metabolic activities of the sieve tubes, ensuring the efficient transport of nutrients, such as sugars, throughout the plant. Characteristics of phloem tissue/tube. Phloem tissue consists of living cells with a thin cytoplasm and is associated with companion cells, which support the transport process by regulating metabolic activities. It has sieve cross walls, called sieve plates, which are perforated with sieve pores that allow food substances to move between cells via protein filaments. The phloem transports food materials in both directions throughout the plant. These features ensure the efficient movement of food materials required for plant growth and development. Figure121.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_121.jpg. Differences between xylem and phloem. Xylem and phloem, while both essential for plant transport, have distinct functions and characteristics. Both tissues feature cells without a nucleus; xylem contains vessels and tracheids, and phloem includes sieve tubes. They also share structural similarities such as perforations—xylem has pits, and phloem has sieve pores in sieve plates—and are surrounded by parenchyma cells that act as packing tissues. However, xylem primarily transports water and minerals unidirectionally from roots to leaves, providing structural support and rigidity to the plant, while phloem transports food materials bidirectionally, from leaves to other parts of the plant, relying on respiratory energy for its active transport processes. Xylem's transport is driven by passive processes like transpiration pull, utilising solar energy, whereas phloem's transport depends on active processes requiring metabolic energy. Additionally, xylem vessels are typically reinforced with lignin for support, whereas phloem cells remain living and are more involved in metabolic regulation, with companion cells playing a crucial role in maintaining the sieve tubes' functionality. Transport of water from soil to the leaves: The uptake, or absorption, of water is a continuous process that moves water through the plant. Root hairs, surrounded by a film of water containing mineral salts (soil solution), are crucial for this process. Root hair vacuoles have a higher solute concentration than the surrounding soil solution, resulting in a lower water potential within the vacuoles. This difference in water potential causes water to move from the soil solution into the vacuole of the root hair. The semi-permeable cell membrane of the root hair allows water to enter the vacuole by osmosis. As water enters, it forms cell sap within the vacuole, which remains more concentrated compared to the soil solution, thereby maintaining the gradient necessary for continued water uptake. As the root hair absorbs water, its osmotic potential decreases relative to neighbouring cells with more concentrated cell sap. This creates an osmotic gradient that drives water from the root hair to adjacent cortex cells and through the cortex, eventually reaching the xylem. Water moves through the root cortex via three pathways: along the vacuole, through the cytoplasm, and from vacuole to vacuole. The innermost layer of the cortex, the endodermis, regulates the movement of water from the cortex into the xylem. The water rises up the xylem by the following forces. Capillarity: This allows water to move up narrow xylem vessels due to surface tension, though this is limited by the vessel's diameter. Cohesion-tension forces: Cohesion between water molecules allows water in a continuous column without breaking. This occurs because as water is lost by transpiration from the leaves, the water potential at the top of xylem vessels falls below that at the bottom of the xylem in the root. Water is now pulled by this potential difference because of the cohesion of the water molecules. Adhesion: Adhesion forces between the walls of xylem and water molecules support a considerable weight of water within the xylem tissue and prevent the xylem vessels from collapsing. Root pressure: This is regarded as the pressuring force of the water up the stem from the roots. Root pressure is an active process confirmed by the fact that it occurs only in living tissues/plants. It is affected by the same factors that affect respiration in living cells like oxygen supply, temperature, starch supply and the presence of respiratory poisons like cyanides. The root pressure theory has been suggested as a result of a common observation that water tends to exude from the cut stem indicating that some pressure in a root is actually pushing the water up. This pressure has been measured using a monometer attached to the stamp and it is this force which is normally called root pressure. The root pressure depends on the type of plant species e.g., vines root pressure is up to 200Kpa has been demonstrated. However, like capillary, pressure is not sufficient on its own to push water to the leaves of the plant at the top of the tree and can slowly cause guttation in transpiring herbaceous plants. Transpiration pull: This is the pulling force generated by the evaporation of water from the leaves. This is caused when the cells of the spongy mesophyll layer in the leaf lose water by evaporation into the air spaces causing their cell sap to become more concentrated and as a result they draw the water from the surrounding cells by osmosis. These cells in turn get water from the xylem in the veins and then water from the xylem moves to replace the lost water by evaporation. This pull extends all the way down to the root hairs, where water from the soil is absorbed. The continuous movement of water from the soil into the root hairs and through the xylem to the leaves is driven by this transpiration pull, which maintains the flow of water necessary for plant hydration and nutrient transport. Mineral salts are absorbed by root hairs in the form of ions and are transported in solution with water through the xylem. The movement of these ions into the plant occurs via two main processes: diffusion, where ions move passively from a region of higher concentration in the soil to a lower concentration in the root cells, and active transport, where energy is used to move ions against their concentration gradient into the root cells, enabling the plant to absorb essential nutrients even when they are in lower concentrations in the soil. Video32.Absorption_of_water_in_plants.mp4. Video30.Root_Adaptations.mp4. • You can use any word processor to prepare an activity report on your investigation of the osmotic flow of water through plant material. [Assignment 3] {How is the root hair adopted for absorption of water and mineral salts}. Adaptations of the root hair to its function of water and mineral salts absorption. A root hair is an extension that develops on the piliferous layer cells (the outer layer of the root) in the root. The root hair is slender and flexible and can therefore flow between the soil particles. They are numerous which increase the surface area available for water absorption. They lack the cuticle which would restrict water absorption. They are long and narrow which increases surface area to volume ratio that increases the rate of water absorption. The cytoplasm of the root hair contains numerous mitochondria where respiration occurs to release ATP needed for active transport of mineral salts from the soil solution to the cytoplasm of the root hairs. All the centre of the root hair is a vascular tissue which transports water and mineral salts to the rest of the plant. The cell sap of the root hair contains sugars, amino acids and salts, and so its concentrated than the soil solution and this low osmotic potential enables water to entre it by osmosis. Video31.Adaptations_Of_Root_Hair_Cells.mp4. Video33.Active_Transport_Root_hair_cell.mp4. • In pairs, use a drawing and look at germinated seedlings to explain how the root hair is adopted for absorption of water and mineral salts. Prepare a report to share with the class. Through whole class discussion, agree on the correct explanation, and record it in notes and or diagrams. Experiment to show that water travels up the plant through the xylem. A small plant with light-coloured flowers is placed in a beaker containing dyed water and left for 24 hours. After this period, the plant is removed, and transverse cuts are made through the stem and roots. Examination under a microscope reveals that the dye has travelled up through the plant's xylem vessels, colouring the flowers and veins of the leaves. The presence of the dye in these tissues demonstrates that water, along with the dye, has been transported through the xylem from the roots to the rest of the plant. Experiment to demonstrate root pressure. In this experiment, the shoot of an actively growing potted plant is cut, leaving about 5cm of stem above the soil. A 30cm glass tube is securely attached to the cut end using rubber tubing, and the tube is partially filled with coloured water. The setup is supported by a retort stand, and the plant is thoroughly watered before being placed in a warm environment for 3 hours. A dry plant is used as a control. After the designated time, the level of coloured water in the glass tube rises, demonstrating that water is absorbed by the roots and pushed upwards through the stem due to root pressure. Importance of water to the plant: Water is vital to plants for several key reasons. It serves as a raw material for photosynthesis, enabling plants to produce their own food. It also acts as a solvent for mineral salts and oxygen, allowing them to diffuse into the roots for essential metabolic processes. Water is a crucial component of the cytoplasm and sap, ensuring proper cellular function and growth. In non-woody plants, water provides turgidity, giving structural support. Additionally, it cools the leaves during transpiration, regulating temperature and prevent overheating. [Assignment 4] {Explore the processes of transpiration and translocation}. Transport of the products of photosynthesis: The process by which the soluble products of photosynthesis are carried in plants is called translocation. Translocation is the movement of manufactured food from the side of photosynthesis. Throughout the plant, sugars and amino acids are transported in the phloem from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant or storage organs. Food substances may also move from the storage organs to the growing regions of the plants. In the phloem, food substances may move upwards/down wards. The process of translocation: The process of photosynthesis leads to accumulation of food substances in leaves. This causes a high turgor pressure within the leaves. Food substances in the roots are used for respiration or they are stored in the storage organs and this results in the low turgor pressure in the root cells. The difference between turgor pressure in the roots and leaves enables the food substances to move from leaves to other parts of the plant by a process called mass flow which is the major process of translocation. This pressure-flow mechanism in the phloem facilitates the movement of sugars and other nutrients from the source (leaves) to the sink (other parts of the plant) through differences in turgor pressure, driving the flow of the plant sap. There is also a minor process i.e., active transport where the sugars e.g., sucrose are actively transported from leaves to the storage organs. Evidence to show that food made in leaves is translocated by the phloem. The ring experiment: Remove a ring of the bark from the stem at a point between the ground and the upper leaves. Leave another plant with the ring on. The plants are left to stand for one week after which the observation is made. Observation: The upper part of the stem of the ring plant swells immediately above the ring while the lower part of the stem remains un swollen. The un ringed plant remains unchanged. Conclusion: The phloem transports manufactured food. Explanation: When a ring of a base is cut, the phloem tissue is removed along with it since it’s found within the bark. This cuts off the supply of manufactured food to the lower parts of the plant as a result, the phloem in the upper part of the stem will transport the food to the part just above the ring. The food will then accumulate in this part hence it will swell. When the ring is removed, the tree or plant also dries because the food supply to the root is cut off therefore the stored food in the roots gets exhausted then the roots die. Feeding Aphids: When the proboscis of the sucking aphid is cut, it is found to have penetrated into the phloem tube and when its contents of the proboscis are analysed, it is found to contain products of photosynthesis (sucrose) which are transported to the bark through the phloem. Radioactive tracers: If a plant is exposed to CO₂ labelled with radioactive C-14, the C-14 becomes incorporated into the end products of photosynthesis which are subsequently detected in the stem. That these substances are confined to the phloem and can be shown by cutting sections of the stem, placing the sections in contact with a photographic film and making auto radiographing it is found that the sites of radioactivity correspond precisely to the positions of the phloem. • In pairs or groups, research on the need for, and the meaning of, translocation in plants.

This is a process by which plants lose water in the form of water vapour, primarily through their leaves, and to a lesser extent through the stem and flowers. It occurs through three main pathways: stomatal transpiration, which involves water loss through the stomata and accounts for 80-90% of total water loss; cuticular transpiration, where water escapes through the waxy cuticle covering the leaves, contributing around 20%; and lenticular transpiration, which occurs through small pores in the stems called lenticels, accounting for about 0.1% of water lost. Additionally, plants can also lose water in liquid form through guttation, where droplets are released from special structures called hydrathodes located at the leaf margins. An experiment to show that water is lost mainly from leaves during transpiration. To demonstrate that water loss during transpiration occurs mainly through leaves, use a potted plant, polythene paper, string, and cobalt (II) chloride paper or anhydrous copper (II) sulphate. Wrap polythene around the pot to prevent soil water evaporation and secure transparent polythene around the plant’s leafy shoot. Set up a control with a plant that has its leaves removed or a dry plant. Place both setups in bright sunlight for 3 hours. After this period, remove the polythene from the leafy shoot and test the collected liquid inside with anhydrous copper (II) sulphate or cobalt (II) chloride paper. Observe that the liquid turns anhydrous copper (II) sulphate from white to blue or cobalt (II) chloride paper from blue to pink, indicating water vapour condensation. No vapour will be observed in the control setup. This confirms that transpiration primarily occurs through the leaves. An experiment to compare transpiration rates on both surfaces of a leaf. To compare transpiration rates on the upper and lower surfaces of a leaf, cobalt (II) chloride paper is fixed onto each surface using glass slides and rubber bands. After observing the time that it takes for the paper on each surface to change colour from blue to pink, it is noted that the paper on the lower surface turns pink faster than that on the upper surface. This indicates a higher transpiration rate on the lower surface, which is attributed to the greater number of stomata typically found on this side of the leaf. However, for water plants, one might expect higher transpiration on the upper surface, as these plants often have more stomata there to facilitate gas exchange in their submerged or partially submerged environments. • In pairs, consider what you know about leaf structure, transport vessels in stems, roots and root hairs, and connect your learning to explain how the process of transpiration takes place. Individually produce an annotated diagram to explain the process. [Assignment 5] {Conduct experiments on and understand the factors that affect transpiration}. Factors affecting the rate of transpiration. The rate of transpiration in a plant changes from time to time. This is because the rate of transpiration of the plant depends on a number of factors. Some of these are environmental while others result from within the plant itself. The environmental conditions are mainly temperature, light intensity, wind movement and humidity (moisture content of the air). Farmers need to monitor these factors throughout the day and across seasons to manage irrigation effectively and prevent excessive water loss. When investigating the impact of a specific factor on transpiration, it's crucial to keep other factors constant to accurately assess its effect. Temperature: Temperature significantly affects the rate of transpiration in plants. Higher temperatures, often resulting from increased sunlight, lead to an increase in transpiration rates. This is because elevated temperatures provide more latent heat of vaporisation, which enhances the evaporation of water from plant surfaces. Additionally, higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of air molecules around the leaf, causing them to move apart and thus accelerating the diffusion of water vapour away from the leaf. Conversely, cloud cover can reduce temperatures by blocking sunlight, which lowers the heat available for evaporation and subsequently reduces the rate of transpiration. Relative humidity: Relative humidity, which refers to the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, plays a crucial role in regulating the rate of transpiration. As humidity increases, the rate of transpiration typically decreases. This is because a higher humidity means that the air is more saturated with water vapour, reducing the gradient between the water vapour concentration inside the leaf and the surrounding air. Consequently, the diffusion of water vapour from the leaf into the air is diminished, leading to a reduced rate of transpiration. Wind: Wind significantly influences the rate of transpiration. In windy conditions, transpiration rates are generally higher than in still air. This is because wind removes water vapour from the air surrounding the leaf, thereby maintaining a steeper diffusion gradient. This gradient facilitates the continuous movement of water vapour from the leaf into the atmosphere. However, if wind speeds become excessively high, transpiration can be reduced or even stopped. This is due to mechanical closure of the stomata to prevent excessive water loss and the cooling effect of the wind, which lowers the leaf temperature and reduces the rate of evaporation. Light intensity: The rate of transpiration is typically higher in the presence of light and lower in the dark. This is because high light intensity stimulates photosynthesis, which increases the concentration of sugars in the guard cells. This leads to the widening of the stomata, allowing more water vapour to escape from the plant. Additionally, light provides heat, which further enhances evaporation from the leaf surface. In contrast, in the dark, photosynthesis slows down, reducing sugar levels in the guard cells and causing the stomata to close, which decreases the rate of transpiration. Availability of water: The availability of water impacts the turgidity of the guard cells, which in turn affects the rate of transpiration. When water is plentiful, guard cells become turgid, causing the stomata to open wider. This increased opening allows more water vapour to escape from the plant, resulting in a higher rate of transpiration. Conversely, when water availability is low, the guard cells become flaccid, causing the stomata to close and reducing the rate of transpiration. Thus, the turgidity of the guard cells is directly linked to the plant's ability to regulate water loss. Atmospheric pressure: Atmospheric pressure affects the rate of transpiration through its influence on humidity. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the humidity of the air also tends to decrease. This reduction in humidity creates a greater gradient between the water vapour concentration inside the leaf and the surrounding air. As a result, water vapour diffuses more rapidly from the leaf into the atmosphere, leading to an increase in the rate of transpiration. Therefore, lower atmospheric pressure can significantly enhance the rate of transpiration due to the associated decrease in humidity. Non-environmental factors: Non-environmental factors influencing the rate of transpiration include the distribution and number of stomata, the surface area of the leaves, and the thickness of the plant cuticle. Transpiration rates are higher when stomata are more concentrated on the upper side of the leaf, while a greater number of stomata generally increases the rate of water loss. Plants with broad leaves have a larger surface area for transpiration, leading to higher rates of water loss compared to those with smaller leaves, such as desert plants. Additionally, a thicker cuticle reduces transpiration by limiting water loss; thus, desert plants often have a thicker cuticle compared to those in more humid tropical regions. Mechanism of stomatal opening and closure: Stomata typically open during the day and close at night. In the presence of sunlight, photosynthesis occurs in the guard cells, leading to the accumulation of sugars. This accumulation lowers the water potential within the guard cells, causing water to move into them by osmosis from the adjacent epidermal cells. As a result, the turgor pressure within the guard cells increases, causing their outer thin, elastic walls to expand. This expansion pulls the inner thick, inelastic walls outward, thereby opening the stomata to facilitate gas exchange and transpiration. Drawing showing a stoma open. Figure122.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_122.jpg. At night, the absence of light halts photosynthesis in the guard cells, leading to a decrease in osmotic pressure as the sugar concentration drops. Consequently, the water potential inside the guard cells increases. This change causes water to move out of the guard cells and into the neighbouring epidermal cells by osmosis. As the guard cells lose water, their turgor pressure decreases, causing the inner thick walls to move closer together and resulting in the closure of the stomata. Drawing showing a stoma closed. Figure123.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_123.jpg. Video35.Translocation_and_Transpiration.mp4. Experiments to measure the rate of transpiration. The weighing method: This method involves weighing a potted plant before and after a set period. The difference in weight reflects the amount of water lost through transpiration. By tracking changes in weight over time, you can determine the rate at which water is being lost by the plant. Potometer method: This technique uses a potometer to measure water uptake by the plant. The potometer operates on the principle that the amount of water absorbed by the plant is approximately equal to the amount lost through transpiration. It measures the rate of water uptake by the plant’s shoot, providing an indirect measure of transpiration. However, results from the potometer might not fully represent the transpiration rate under specific conditions, as some of the water absorbed is used for photosynthesis or maintaining cell turgidity, rather than being lost through transpiration. Set up of a potometer: Figure449.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_002.jpg. Procedure: To measure the rate of transpiration using a potometer, a leafy shoot is cut underwater to prevent air bubbles from entering the xylem vessels. The potometer is filled with water, and the shoot is inserted into a cork, which is then fitted into the potometer vessel, with vaseline applied to seal the setup airtight. An air bubble is introduced at the open end of the capillary tube by touching the open end briefly under water and then releasing, and its position is recorded at a specific mark, V1, while a clock is started. After a set time, t, the new position, V2, is noted. Figure124.2.6.transport_in_plants_image_124.jpg. The experiment is repeated three times under the same conditions, resetting the air bubble after each experiment by opening the tap and then closing, and the average rate of transpiration in that environment is calculated by dividing the average distance moved by the air bubble by the average time taken [Rate of transpiration = average distance moved by the air bubble / average time taken]. This setup can be moved to different environmental conditions to assess how transpiration rates change with varying factors. Precautions taken when using a potometer in order to ensure accurate results: To ensure accurate results when using a potometer, follow these precautions and understand their importance: use a leafy shoot to ensure substantial water loss, and cut the shoot underwater to prevent air from entering and blocking the xylem vessels, which would disrupt water uptake. Ensure the entire apparatus is filled with distilled water to prevent inaccuracies caused by impurities. Introduce and reset a single air bubble in the capillary tube for each experiment, as multiple bubbles or an incorrect starting point can lead to measurement errors. Use a graduated capillary tube to obtain precise readings, and make sure the air bubble does not cross the T-junction at the reservoir to maintain accuracy. Conduct experiments under consistent temperature and lighting conditions to avoid variability in transpiration rates, handle the apparatus gently to prevent disturbances, ensure all joints and connections are airtight to prevent air leaks, and regularly calibrate the potometer to ensure accurate measurements. Video34.A_bubble_potometer.mp4. Adaptations of plants to reduce transpiration rate: Plants have developed various adaptations to minimise water loss through transpiration. Deciduous trees like maples shed their leaves during dry seasons to conserve water. In arid environments, plants such as prickly pear cacti modify their leaves into spines and store water in their stems, while succulents like Aloe vera roll their leaves to create a humid microenvironment around the stomata. Euphorbia species feature sunken stomata and thick cuticles to reduce evaporation. Plants like Ponderosa pine adjust their stomatal openings, closing them during the hottest parts of the day and opening them at night, while tropical plants such as bromeliads use CAM photosynthesis to open their stomata at night and close them during the day, effectively managing water loss under varying conditions. Importance of transpiration: Transpiration plays a crucial role in plant health and function. It drives the absorption of water from the soil, facilitating its upward movement through the plant. The transported water is essential for processes such as photosynthesis and keeps plant cells turgid, which is vital for structural support and preventing wilting. Additionally, the loss of water through transpiration cools the plant, protecting it from overheating. Furthermore, transpiration aids in the transport of essential mineral salts from the soil to various parts of the plant, ensuring that nutrients are delivered where they are needed for growth and development. Disadvantages of transpiration: While transpiration is crucial for plant health, excessive water loss through this process can lead to several issues. It can cause wilting, drying, and potentially death of the plant if water loss surpasses uptake. Over-cooling from excessive transpiration may disrupt metabolic activities, impairing plant functions. High transpiration rates also increase water demand, making it challenging for plants to sustain themselves, especially in arid conditions. Additionally, excessive transpiration can lead to nutrient imbalances and soil exhaustion due to over-absorption of mineral salts, further stressing the plant and affecting its overall health and productivity. • In groups, use scientific process skills to design and carry out experiments to investigate how wind, temperature, and light intensity affect the rate of transpiration.
