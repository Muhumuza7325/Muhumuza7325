Theme ***Interrelationships*** "@OMD". TOPIC 12.2 ***FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WEBS*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates the interdependence of organisms in a given ecosystem. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the feeding relationships in an ecosystem, and express them using food chains, webs, and pyramids (k, u, s); b) appreciate the organisms and processes involved in the carbon cycle, and its role in maintaining the carbon dioxide balance in the atmosphere (u, v). • In groups, study a local ecosystem through field visits and observe, identify, and record the organisms. • note what food sources the animal species rely upon • draw simple food chains and develop these into a food web • identify the trophic levels of the organisms observed. • Share your reports with the class to ensure that all have a good level of understanding. • In groups, use the data from your local ecosystem, or use data provided showing numbers of organisms found in, for example, a grassland ecosystem, to: • categorize the organisms as producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers • calculate the number of organisms in each trophic level • use the numbers to construct a pyramid of numbers • explain the appearance of the pyramid • Individually record conclusions and draw pyramids.
