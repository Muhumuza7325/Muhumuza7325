[Assignment 1] {Identify three characteristics (cell structure, cell organization, and mode of feeding) of organisms in kingdom Monera, kingdom Protoctista and kingdom Fungi}. The kingdoms Monera, Protista or Protoctista, and Fungi exhibit significant diversity in their cellular structures, organisational complexity, and feeding mechanisms, reflecting their diverse evolutionary adaptations. Monera, encompassing bacteria and archaea, are characterised by prokaryotic cells lacking a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They exist as single cells or in simple colonies. Their genetic material consists of a single, circular double stranded DNA molecule located in the nucleoid region, not enclosed by a nuclear membrane. Additionally, many species possess smaller, circular DNA fragments called plasmids, which can carry genes for antibiotic resistance and other specialised functions. Some Monerans are further protected by a capsule, a gelatinous layer surrounding the cell wall that enhances their ability to evade the host immune system and adhere to surfaces. Most Monerans possess a rigid cell wall, primarily composed of peptidoglycan in bacteria, which provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and prevents osmotic lysis. However, some bacteria, such as those of the genus Mycoplasma (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae), lack a cell wall and instead rely on mucin-like glycoproteins or other adaptations for structural integrity. Many Monerans exhibit motility, utilising structures like flagella (long, whip-like appendages) and pili (short, hair-like structures) to move through their environment or adhere to surfaces. Flagella are typically longer and fewer in number, providing locomotion, while pili (singular—pilus), although primarily involved in attachment and the exchange of genetic material during conjugation (a form of horizontal gene transfer where genetic material is transferred between bacterial cells), can also play a role in limited motility. General structure of a bacterium: Figure278.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_001.jpg. Nutritionally, Monerans are diverse, with some being autotrophs (photosynthetic or chemosynthetic) such as photosynthetic cyanobacteria, while others are heterotrophs such as saprophytic and parasitic bacteria, obtaining nutrients through absorption from the environment. They reproduce asexually primarily through binary fission, where a single cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. Additionally, some bacteria can form spores, such as endospores, but this is a survival mechanism rather than a method of reproduction. Notably, some Monerans are extremophiles, thriving in extreme environments like hot springs (Thermococcus), salt flats (Halobacterium), and acidic habitats (Sulfolobus), demonstrating their remarkable adaptability. Notably, some Monerans exhibit remarkable adaptability to extreme environments. These extremophiles include archaeal genera such as Thermococcus, thriving in high-temperature environments like hot springs; Halobacterium, found in highly saline environments like salt flats; and Sulfolobus, which inhabits acidic habitats. Additionally, certain bacterial extremophiles, like Deinococcus radiodurans, renowned for its resistance to radiation, and Thermus aquaticus, a source of the heat-stable enzyme Taq polymerase, demonstrate exceptional resilience to extreme conditions. Note that Archaea and bacteria exhibit significant differences: Whereas bacteria typically have one origin of DNA replication, archaea tend to have several. Unlike bacteria, archaea possess distinct membrane lipids with ether linkages and isoprenoid side chains, while bacteria have ester linkages and fatty acid side chains. Archaea also have unique ribosomal RNA sequences, which place them in a separate domain of life. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan, a characteristic feature of bacteria. Furthermore, archaea exhibit a range of metabolic capabilities, including methanogenesis, which is not found in bacteria. These fundamental differences enable archaea to thrive in various extreme environments. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed more genetic similarities between archaea and eukaryotes than between archaea and bacteria, highlighting the complex evolutionary relationships among these domains of life. The term "protists" traditionally referred to a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that did not fit neatly into the kingdoms of plants, animals, or fungi. However, this classification has long been nullified, as it does not accurately reflect evolutionary relationships. Instead, modern taxonomy groups these organisms into various clades within the domain Eukarya based on molecular and genetic evidence. While we avoid using the term "protists" in contemporary science, we will cover the organisms previously categorised under this group. Protists represent a diverse and fascinating group of eukaryotic organisms, exhibiting a remarkable range of forms, sizes, and lifestyles. As eukaryotes, they possess a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They inhabit a wide range of environments, including water, moist environments, and even within other organisms. Protists exhibit a remarkable diversity in form and function, ranging from unicellular forms like amoebae (or amoebas, particularly in American English) and paramecia to multicellular forms like seaweed. Seaweed are marine macroalgae which include diverse groups such as: brown algae (Phylum Phaeophyceae), exemplified by kelp like Macrocystis pyrifera and Laminaria; red algae (Phylum Rhodophyta), such as Corallina species; and green algae (Phylum Chlorophyta), including Chlamydomonas, Volvox, and Spirogyra. Some protists can have more than one nucleus, illustrating the diversity of cellular structures within this group. For instance, paramecium has a macronucleus for metabolism and growth, along with one or more micronuclei for reproduction. Similarly, the slime mould Physarum polycephalum exists as a multinucleate mass during its vegetative stage. Algae often possess cell walls (e.g., silica-based in diatoms), while many protozoa lack rigid cell walls, relying on a flexible outer covering called a pellicle for some structural support. While the term "Protozoa" is not a valid taxonomic group in modern classification systems, it is still informally used to refer to a diverse group of single-celled eukaryotic organisms that are generally heterotrophic, traditionally considered animal-like protists. This informal grouping includes organisms like amoebae, paramecia, and many other single-celled protists. Protists exhibit a wide array of motility mechanisms. Flagella propel many protists, such as Euglena and Trypanosoma. Cilia are utilised by others, like Paramecium, for movement. Amoebae move through the use of pseudopodia (false feet), temporary extensions of their cytoplasm. Other protists glide along surfaces or utilise specialised structures for movement. Protists exhibit diverse feeding strategies, including autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic modes of nutrition. Autotrophic protists, such as algae, synthesise their own food through photosynthesis, as seen in diatoms and Chlamydomonas. Heterotrophic protists, like Amoeba and Paramecium, ingest other organisms or organic matter through phagocytosis, where they engulf and internalise their food particles, while others, such as slime moulds and Trypanosomes, absorb nutrients from their surroundings. Mixotrophic protists, such as some dinoflagellates and Euglena, can switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of nutrition depending on environmental conditions. In particular, Amoeba, a free-living protozoan often found at the bottom of ponds, captures food by extending its pseudopodia around the target, engulfing it through a process called phagocytosis. The engulfed food is enclosed within a food vacuole, where digestive enzymes are secreted to break it down into soluble substances. These nutrients are absorbed into the cytoplasm and utilised for energy and growth. Figure279.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_002.jpg. Concurrently, the amoeba maintains its internal water balance through the action of its contractile vacuole. This organelle collects excess water that enters the cell due to osmosis and expels it from the cell, preventing the amoeba from swelling and bursting. As the Amoeba moves, egestion occurs. This involves the fusion of the food vacuole with the cell membrane, releasing undigested materials into the surrounding environment. Paramecium captures food using cilia, which are hair-like structures that beat rhythmically to sweep food particles, such as bacteria and algae, into the oral groove (hollow gullet). The food particles are then enclosed within a food vacuole that forms at the base of the oral groove. Digestive enzymes are secreted into the vacuole to break down the food into soluble nutrients, which are absorbed into the cytoplasm and utilised for energy and growth. The food vacuoles follow a specific path through the cytoplasm, and the undigested remains are expelled through the anal pore at a designated point near the region of ingestion, completing the process of digestion and egestion. Figure280.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_003.jpg. Reproduction in protists is diverse, encompassing both asexual and sexual methods. Asexual reproduction is common, occurring through mechanisms such as binary fission (splitting into two identical daughter cells) as seen in Amoeba, multiple fission (dividing into multiple daughter cells) observed in some protists, and budding (the formation of a new organism from a small outgrowth of the parent) as observed in Paramecium. Some protists also exhibit sexual reproduction, involving the fusion of gametes, as seen in Plasmodium and certain species of algae. Spirogyra reproduces both asexually, through fragmentation where a portion of the filament breaks off and grows into a new individual, and sexually through conjugation, involving the fusion of gametes from two filaments. Fungi, including moulds, yeasts, and mushrooms, are eukaryotic organisms characterised by the presence of a carbohydrate called chitin in their cell walls and the absence of chloroplasts. Most fungi are predominantly multicellular and typically exhibit a filamentous growth form; however, unicellular yeasts do not display this filamentous structure, existing instead as single cells. Fungi are found in a wide range of habitats, including soil, water, decaying organic matter, and as symbionts or parasites in plants and animals. While many fungi are sessile (immobile) throughout their life cycle, some exhibit limited motility. The vegetative body of fungi, known as the mycelium, consists of an intricate network of thread-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae grow, branch, and intertwine extensively, forming the main structural framework of the fungus. This extensive growth also allows fungi to effectively explore their environment and colonise new areas. Additionally, fungal spores can be dispersed by various means, such as wind, water, and animal vectors, facilitating the spread of fungi to new locations. Fungi are heterotrophs, primarily obtaining nutrients through absorption, functioning as saprophytes or parasites. This mode of feeding often involves the secretion of enzymes to break down organic matter externally (extracellular digestion) and then absorbing the resulting nutrients. Fungi can also engage in mutualistic relationships with other organisms. Fungi reproduce through both sexual and asexual means, with modes of reproduction varying by species. Asexual reproduction typically involves the production of spores (e.g., conidia or sporangiospores), budding (as in yeasts), or fragmentation of hyphae. Sexual reproduction occurs through the fusion of specialised reproductive structures, resulting in genetically diverse spores. [Assignment 2] {Give examples of organisms belonging to kingdom Monera, kingdom Protoctista and kingdom Fungi}. Kingdom Monera encompasses all prokaryotic organisms, including archaea and bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis (a soil bacterium known for its role in biotechnology), Escherichia coli (a common bacterium that inhabits the human gut), Streptococcus pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes tuberculosis), Salmonella typhi (that causes typhoid fever), Vibrio cholerae (that causes cholera), Helicobacter pylori (that causes stomach ulcers), Clostridium tetani (which causes tetanus), Staphylococcus aureus (associated with various infections), Legionella pneumophila (which causes Legionnaires' disease), Clostridium botulinum (the source of botulism), Streptobacillus moniliformis (which causes rat-bite fever), and Cyanobacteria like Anabaena and Nostoc that perform photosynthesis, contributing to oxygen production. Bacteria play critical roles in various aspects of life, both ecologically and industrially. As primary decomposers, bacteria break down dead organic matter, recycling essential nutrients back into the ecosystem. This process is crucial for maintaining soil fertility and supporting plant growth. In the nitrogen cycle, bacteria like Rhizobium fix atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms for plants, while denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that contribute significantly to oxygen production and serve as primary producers in aquatic food chains, forming the base of many aquatic ecosystems. Industrially, some bacteria are indispensable in food production (e.g., Lactobacillus bulgaricus for yoghurt, Streptococcus thermophilus for cheese, and Acetobacter aceti for vinegar) through fermentation processes. Some bacteria are crucial in biotechnology, aiding in genetic engineering, antibiotic production, and enzyme synthesis, with applications in various industries, including pharmaceuticals and agriculture. For instance, Escherichia coli is widely utilised in genetic engineering for the production of insulin and other recombinant proteins. Streptomyces species are integral to the production of antibiotics such as streptomycin and tetracycline. Meanwhile, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are employed in enzyme synthesis, contributing to applications in detergents and food processing. Some bacteria are responsible for manufacturing essential vitamins, such as vitamin B₁₂ (produced by Propionibacterium and Lactobacillus) and vitamin K (produced by Escherichia coli in the human gut). They also play a role in curing tea and tobacco and in making silage through processes like retting flax, which involves treating and preserving plant materials. In sewage treatment, some bacteria may be used to aid in eliminating harmful organisms, contributing to environmental health. Furthermore, symbiotic bacteria in ruminants aid in cellulose digestion by secreting the enzyme cellulase, enabling the efficient utilisation of plant-based diets. While some bacteria cause food spoilage and harmful diseases in humans and plants (including banana bacterial wilt, fire blight, and soft rot), these challenges also present economic opportunities. Figure281.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_004.jpg. Video128.Bacteria.mp4. Video129.Archaea.mp4. Kingdom Protoctista includes diverse eukaryotic organisms, such as Paramecium caudatum and Amoeba proteus (unicellular protozoa that move using cilia and pseudopodia, respectively), Plasmodium falciparum (a unicellular parasitic protozoan responsible for malaria), Trypanosoma brucei (a unicellular parasitic protozoan responsible for African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals), Euglena gracilis (a unicellular protist, recognised as a novel food source and a potential biofuel producer, with both plant-like (chloroplasts) and animal-like (flagella) characteristics), and Chlamydomonas (a unicellular green alga capable of photosynthesis). Additionally, the Kingdom Protoctista includes multicellular organisms such as Macrocystis (giant kelp) and Laminaria (both examples of large multicellular brown algae), and Spirogyra (a filamentous green alga often found in fresh water of slow flowing water in ponds, streams, and lakes). Protists play crucial roles in various ecosystems, serving as primary producers, decomposers, and a food source for many other organisms. As primary producers, many protists, particularly phytoplankton, harness sunlight through photosynthesis, producing oxygen and serving as the foundation of aquatic food webs. They recycle nutrients in ecosystems by breaking down organic matter, which supports nutrient cycling and maintains ecosystem health. Some protists, such as slime moulds, contribute to decomposition and soil fertility, while others, like diatoms, are essential for carbon fixation and contribute significantly to global oxygen production. In industry, protists have various applications; for instance, Chlorella and Spirulina are cultivated as dietary supplements due to their high protein and nutrient content. Certain algal species are used in the production of agar, a thickening agent in food and microbiological applications. Some algae extracts are used in various cosmetic products, such as moisturisers, anti-aging creams, and hair care products, due to their moisturising, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, some algae are used in the manufacture of ice cream as stabilisers. Protists are also important in biotechnology, as they are sources of bioactive compounds, including pharmaceuticals and antioxidants. However, some protists can be pathogenic, causing diseases in humans (such as malaria caused by Plasmodium species), plants, and animals, highlighting the importance of research and public health measures to manage these challenges. However, many protists can be pathogenic, causing diseases in plants, animals, and humans (such as malaria caused by Plasmodium species and amoebic dysentery caused by Entamoeba histolytica). Notably, the Irish potato famine in the 1800s was caused by the water mould Phytophthora infestans, which devastated potato crops and led to widespread starvation. Figure282.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_005.jpg. Figure283.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_006.jpg. In Kingdom Fungi, examples include Saccharomyces cerevisiae (unicellular baker’s yeast, essential for bread and beer production), Rhizopus stolonifer, the common bread mould (a multicellular saprophytic fungus that grows on decaying organic matter such as bread and fruits), Mucor (a genus of fungi that grow on soil and dead plants, including saprophytic species and opportunistic pathogens that take advantage of the weak immune systems), Aspergillus niger (a multicellular mould used in industrial enzyme production), and Penicillium notatum (a multicellular mould that is the source of the antibiotic penicillin, but can also cause food spoilage), Agaricus bisporus (the multicellular white button mushroom, a common edible fungus), as well as puffballs (mushrooms characterised by their spherical fruiting bodies and the release of spores through a single pore at the top), toadstools (a general term for various types of mushrooms, some of which are toxic), and smuts (a group of plant-parasitic fungi, primarily affecting cereal crops like corn, wheat, and barley). Fungi play vital roles in both ecological and industrial processes. As decomposers, they break down dead organic matter, recycling essential nutrients into the ecosystem, which is crucial for maintaining soil health and supporting plant growth. Mycelium, the fungal network, facilitates nutrient exchange among organisms, further enhancing ecosystem interactions. Fungi also contribute to bioremediation by breaking down environmental pollutants. In symbiotic relationships, lichens – a mutualistic partnership between fungi and photosynthetic organisms like algae or cyanobacteria – play crucial roles in ecosystems. They act as pioneer species, contributing to soil formation by breaking down rocks. Their sensitivity to air pollutants makes them valuable bioindicators of environmental quality. Furthermore, lichens provide a food source and habitat for various organisms, particularly in extreme environments where other life forms may struggle to survive. Mycorrhizae (singular—mycorrhiza)—a mutualistic association between plant roots and fungi—enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, particularly essential elements like phosphorus from the soil. In industry, some fungi are crucial for food production (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae for bread, beer, and wine; Penicillium camemberti for cheese and Aspergillus oryzae for soy sauce) through fermentation. Moreover, certain fungi are essential in biotechnology for the production of enzymes such as amylase and antibiotics such as penicillin. Additionally, yeast cells are a source of vitamin B extract, and edible fungi like mushrooms provide food and are a source of income. While some fungi can spoil food, clothes, and leather, and some are pathogenic, causing diseases in plants (such as rust, smut, and powdery mildew) and in humans (including ringworm, athlete's foot, and candidiasis), these challenges also present economic opportunities, including potential applications in military contexts for biological weapons. Figure284.1.4.the_five_kingdoms_of_living_organisms_image_007.jpg. Video130.Protists_and_Fungi.mp4. [Assignment 3] {Explore the value of microorganisms in food-making processes}. Microorganisms are tiny living organisms, including archaea, bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and algae, that can only be seen under a microscope. Some play an indispensable role in food-making processes, contributing to production, preservation (which extends product shelf life), and the enhancement of flavour, texture, and nutritional value across various products. By maintaining tailored conditions, microbial activity is optimised, transforming raw materials into diverse, nutritious, and high-quality food products that meet both traditional and modern dietary demands. Yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), are central to baking and brewing, where they ferment sugars to produce carbon dioxide and/or alcohol. In bread-making, the carbon dioxide released by yeast causes the dough to rise, creating a soft, airy texture. This fermentation, a form of anaerobic respiration (the process in which cells generate energy without oxygen), occurs optimally at 25–35°C with adequate moisture content in the dough to support yeast activity. Baking powder, a chemical leavening agent, relies on a comparable principle, releasing carbon dioxide when it reacts with moisture and heat, which enhances the rising of batter or dough. Batter, being thinner and pourable, differs from dough, which is firmer and mouldable, but both benefit from these gas-producing reactions. Video131.Bread.mp4. Alcohol production employs the same yeast, with fermentation of sugars in grains or fruits producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. Temperature control is crucial, with 15–25°C ideal for beer, 20–30°C for wine, and stricter sterilisation and hygiene standards to prevent contamination by undesirable microorganisms. In lager brewing, Saccharomyces pastorianus (commonly known as lager yeast) performs bottom fermentation at cooler temperatures (typically between 10-13°C), converting sugars in the wort (a liquid derived from malted grains) into alcohol and carbon dioxide. During wine production, lactic acid bacteria convert malic acid in grape juice to lactic acid, contributing to the flavour profile of red wine. Oxygen exclusion is critical during fermentation to ensure anaerobic respiration, while sugar concentration in the substrate (e.g., malted grains for beer or grape juice for wine) must be sufficient to sustain yeast activity, critical for quality results. Video132.Vodka.mp4. Video133.Grape_wine.mp4. Bacteria, including Lactobacillus species, are crucial in the production of fermented foods such as yoghurt, cheese, and sauerkraut, where they convert lactose and other sugars into lactic acid, aiding in preservation and developing characteristic tangy flavours. In the dairy industry, yoghurt production involves a meticulous series of steps to ensure a high-quality, creamy, and tangy product. Firstly, high-quality milk is heated to approximately 76-82°C for at least 15 seconds, to eliminate any microorganisms that could compete with the beneficial bacteria during fermentation. This heating process, often referred to as pasteurisation, is crucial for ensuring the safety and quality of the final product. Following pasteurisation, the milk is rapidly cooled to a temperature between 40-45°C, which is the optimal temperature for the growth of the starter culture. To initiate fermentation, a starter culture is introduced to the warm milk. This can be a small amount of plain yoghurt containing a mixture of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, or a commercially available starter culture containing specific strains of these bacteria. These beneficial bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk, producing lactic acid that gives yoghurt its characteristic tangy flavour, with thorough stirring ensuring their even distribution. The lactic acid reacts with water to release hydrogen ions, lowering the pH of the milk to approximately [4.0-4.6]. This causes casein proteins to destabilise and aggregate into a gel-like structure, thickening the milk. The inoculated milk (milk mixed with beneficial bacteria) is carefully transferred to sterilised containers to prevent contamination. These containers are then placed in a warm environment, such as a yoghurt maker or an insulated container with warm water, to maintain a stable temperature for fermentation. The fermentation process typically takes 4-8 hours, with an ideal incubation time of around 6 hours. During this period, it is crucial to maintain a consistent temperature to ensure optimal bacterial growth and prevent the development of off-flavours. Once the desired acidity and firmness are achieved, the fermentation process is halted by cooling the yoghurt. A small amount of whey, a slightly yellowish liquid, may separate on the surface of the yoghurt. This whey can either be stirred back into the yoghurt or discarded. It can then be flavoured with fruits, sweeteners, or other ingredients before being packaged for sale. These carefully controlled steps ensure the production of high-quality yoghurt with a rich flavour and probiotic benefits. Video134.Yoghurt.mp4. Similarly, cheese-making involves the use of starter cultures containing lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus, to curdle milk at temperatures of 30–37°C, separating it into curds and whey. Additionally, rennet is added to promote coagulation, facilitating the formation of the desired cheese texture. Specific fungi, such as Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium camemberti, are introduced during the ripening of mould-ripened cheeses like blue cheese and Camembert, which require controlled humidity levels of 80–95% and controlled ripening temperatures (typically 10–15°C) to develop their unique textures and flavours. Video135.Cheese.mp4. Beyond these traditional roles, microorganisms contribute to innovative food technologies, such as the development of probiotics (live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits to the host). Probiotics not only enhance gut health, but also add significant value to functional foods. Additionally, a growing body of research suggests a strong link between a healthy gut microbiome and enhanced cognitive function, including aspects of intelligence such as learning, memory, and problem-solving. The gut microbiome refers to the diverse community of microorganisms residing within the digestive tract. In summary, some microorganisms contribute to food preservation through various mechanisms: Lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) lowers the pH, inhibiting spoilage microorganisms; beneficial microbes can outcompete spoilage organisms for nutrients; and some microorganisms produce natural antimicrobial compounds. Some microorganisms also significantly impact flavour development: Yeast for example, produces esters and alcohols, contributing to the aroma of beer, wine, and bread; bacteria produce diverse compounds like diacetyl, enhancing the buttery flavour of cheeses; and fungi utilise enzymes to break down proteins and fats, developing unique flavours and aromas in cheeses. Furthermore, some microorganisms enhance nutritional value: They synthesise vitamins, improve protein bioavailability by breaking down complex proteins, and can even degrade complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. Additionally, probiotics (live microorganisms with health benefits) are increasingly incorporated into foods like yoghurt and fermented drinks. • In groups, research on and make summary write-ups on the use of bacteria and fungi in the production of yoghurt, cheese, bread and alcohol. • In groups, discuss, design and carry out an experiment to investigate the conditions required for the production of yoghurt. Write a formal report of the experiment (prediction, materials, procedure, record/analysis of results and conclusion) and present your reports to the rest of the class. [Assignment 4] {Identify three characteristics (cell structure, mode of feeding, and photosynthetic pigment) of organisms in kingdom plantae}. Video145.Introduction_to_Botany.mp4. The kingdom Plantae encompasses a vast array of organisms, from towering trees to microscopic mosses, all of which exhibit distinctive characteristics that define their structure, function, and ecological role. The multicellular nature of organisms within the plant kingdom allows for the development of specialised tissues and organs, such as roots for anchorage, stems for support and nutrient transport, and leaves for photosynthesis. This division of labour enhances the efficiency and complexity of plant life. One key feature of plants is their cell structure, which is fundamentally different from that of animal and fungal kingdoms. Plant cells are eukaryotic, meaning they possess a true nucleus that houses their genetic material (DNA). This nucleus is bound by a double membrane, separating it from the rest of the cell. They possess a rigid cell wall made primarily of cellulose, a polysaccharide that provides protection and structural support while maintaining turgor pressure, allowing plants to grow upright and withstand various environmental pressures. The cell wall distinguishes them from animal cells, which lack such a structure, and differs from the cell walls found in fungal cells, which are primarily composed of chitin. In addition to the cell wall, plant cells contain various membrane-bound organelles, such as chloroplasts, which are specialised for photosynthesis. Additionally, plant cells contain various membrane-bound organelles, including plastids, which serve multiple functions within the cell. Among these plastids are chloroplasts, which are specialised for photosynthesis. Chloroplasts contain thylakoid membranes where light-dependent reactions occur, as well as the stroma, where the light-independent reactions take place. This complex internal structure supports the plant's metabolic processes and growth. In terms of the mode of feeding, plants are primarily autotrophic, producing their own food through the process of photosynthesis, a complex biochemical process. They utilise sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to synthesise glucose and oxygen, a process that is essential for their survival and growth. The ability to photosynthesise allows plants to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose (sugar)— the primary source of energy for plant growth and development, which can be used immediately or stored primarily as starch for later use. This autotrophic nature not only sustains the plants themselves but also supports entire ecosystems, as plants serve as the primary producers that form the base of the food chain. However, it is important to note that some plants do not photosynthesise. For example, certain species of parasitic plants, such as Rafflesia and dodder (Cuscuta), derive their nutrients by parasitising other plants, obtaining water and organic compounds directly from their hosts. Additionally, some plants, like Monotropa uniflora (ghost plant), are mycoheterotrophic, meaning they rely on symbiotic relationships with fungi to access nutrients from surrounding soil and other plants. Another critical characteristic of plants is their photosynthetic pigments, predominantly chlorophyll, specifically chlorophyll a and b. These pigments are located within the chloroplasts and play a vital role in capturing light energy from the sun. Chlorophyll a is essential for the primary light reactions of photosynthesis, absorbing light most efficiently in the blue and red wavelengths, while chlorophyll b assists by capturing additional light energy and transferring it to chlorophyll a. This light energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose through photosynthesis, while releasing oxygen as a by-product. The presence of chlorophyll not only facilitates the process of photosynthesis but also reflects green light, imparting the characteristic green colour to most plants, which is a key visual indicator of their presence in various ecosystems. In addition to chlorophyll, plants contain other pigments that contribute to their colouration. Carotenoids produce yellow and orange hues, seen in carrots and autumn leaves, while carotene, a specific type of carotenoid, is responsible for the vibrant orange colour in foods like carrots and sweet potatoes. Xanthophylls, another type of carotenoid, contribute to yellow pigments, particularly in the leaves. Anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid, provide red, purple, and blue shades, as observed in fruits like blueberries and red cabbage. These and many other pigments play vital roles in attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, as well as in protecting plants from damage caused by excess sunlight and environmental stress. Together, these characteristics—rigid cell structure, autotrophic mode of feeding, and the presence of photosynthetic pigments—illustrate the unique adaptations of plants that enable them to thrive in diverse environments, play a crucial role in global carbon cycling, and provide essential resources for other organisms. [Assignment 5] {Give examples of organisms from each of the following categories: vascular & nonvascular, angiosperms & gymnosperms, monocots & dicots in kingdom Plantae (No drawings required)}. The kingdom Plantae encompasses a diverse array of organisms classified based on characteristics such as vascularity, reproductive methods, seed type, and cotyledon number, as well as their structural and functional adaptations to various habitats. Vascular plants, also known as tracheophytes, belong to the clade Tracheophyta. They are characterised by the presence of specialised vascular tissues: xylem and phloem. The xylem transports water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant, while the phloem transports sugars (produced by photosynthesis) from the leaves to other parts of the plant where they are needed for growth, storage, or energy use. These tissues not only facilitate efficient internal transport, allowing vascular plants to grow taller and larger, but also provide essential structural support. This enables them to thrive in diverse habitats, from arid deserts to dense forests, and withstand environmental pressures like wind and gravity. In contrast to vascular plants, nonvascular plants, informally known as bryophytes, lack specialised vascular tissues. Consequently, they rely on slower processes like diffusion and osmosis to absorb and transport water and nutrients throughout their bodies. This limitation restricts their size and growth potential, typically confining them to moist, shaded environments where water is readily available. Bryophytes possess structures that resemble true roots, leaves, and stems, which are called rhizoids (for anchoring), leaf-like structures (for photosynthesis), and stem-like structures (for support), respectively. This group includes mosses (phylum Bryophyta), liverworts (phylum Hepatophyta), and hornworts (phylum Anthocerotophyta), which are often found carpeting or matting forest floors, rocky crevices, and wetlands, forming dense layers that help retain moisture and provide habitat for various organisms. In particular, mosses are known for their ability to absorb water and nutrients directly through their leaf-like structures and stem-like structures, making them well-suited to environments where soil may be minimal or absent. They play a crucial role in ecosystems by helping to retain moisture and preventing soil erosion. Mosses can tolerate varying levels of light and can often be found in both sunny and shaded areas. The life cycle of mosses is characterised by a dominant gametophyte generation (haploid). This is the familiar leafy-like green part of the moss plant. The gametophyte produces gametes (sex cells), which fuse to form a zygote. The zygote develops into a sporophyte (diploid), a structure that grows on the gametophyte. The sporophyte produces spores through meiosis. These spores are released and can germinate into new gametophytes, starting the cycle anew. This alternation of generations, with its emphasis on spore dispersal, allows mosses to effectively colonise new habitats, even those with limited or absent soil. Additionally, mosses contribute to biodiversity by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates, further enhancing the ecological balance within their environments. Video136.Vascular_and_Nonvascular_Plants.mp4. Vascular plants can be divided into two main groups based on their mode of reproduction: seedless vascular plants (clade Polypodiopsida) and seed-bearing vascular plants (clade Spermatophyta). Seedless vascular plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns (phylum Monilophyta), as well as club mosses, spike mosses, and quillworts (phylum Lycopodiophyta), reproduce via spores rather than seeds. These plants are often found in humid and temperate regions, such as tropical rainforests or along riverbanks, where their spores can disperse and germinate easily. In particular, ferns are commonly found in shaded, damp environments with cool temperatures, such as forests, ravines, and areas near streams. Some fern species have adapted to grow as epiphytes on trees, obtaining moisture and nutrients from the air and rain without harming the host plant. The fern life cycle is characterised by a dominant sporophyte generation, the diploid phase that produces spores. In contrast, the gametophyte generation, the haploid phase that produces gametes, is short-lived and less conspicuous. The sporophyte, the familiar fern plant with fronds (leaves), rhizomes (horizontal stems), and adventitious roots, releases haploid spores. Sori, which are clusters of spore-forming structures, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The adventitious roots anchor the plants and absorb water and nutrients, enhancing their stability and adaptability in moist habitats. The spores enable ferns to colonise diverse habitats, including those with limited or absent soil. Their ability to thrive in varying light conditions also contributes to their ecological success and biodiversity support. On the other hand, seed-bearing vascular plants are divided into two major groups: gymnosperms (non-flowering plants) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Gymnosperms (clade Gymnospermae) are non-flowering plants, predominantly evergreen, that are well-suited to cooler and drier environments, such as boreal forests. They produce "naked" seeds not enclosed within a fruit or nut. These seeds are often exposed and located on the scales of cones, a characteristic feature of many gymnosperms. Their needle-like leaves are an adaptation that minimises water loss, enabling gymnosperms to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Alongside robust reproductive strategies, these features ensure their survival in challenging habitats. They include conifers such as pines (Pinus), firs (Abies), and spruces (phylum Pinophyta, also known as Coniferophyta), which dominate cooler regions; cycads (phylum Cycadophyta), palm-like plants found in tropical and subtropical areas; and members of phylum Gnetophyta like Welwitschia, Ephedra, and Gnetum, which are suited to desert and arid environments. Additionally, ginkgo trees (phylum Ginkgophyta), represented by the sole living species Ginkgo biloba, are notable for their fan-shaped leaves and unique reproductive structures. It is important to note that some gymnosperms, like those in phylum Gnetophyta, have flower-like reproductive structures, but these lack key features like ovaries and petals, serving instead as specialised adaptations for reproduction. In contrast, angiosperms (phylum Anthophyta, also known as Magnoliophyta) are flowering plants that produce seeds enclosed within a fruit, which develops from the ovary of the flower. This fruit provides protection for the seeds and aids in their dispersal. Angiosperms can be herbaceous or woody, showcasing remarkable diversity in form and habitat. They thrive in a wide range of environments, from aquatic settings like water lilies (Nymphaeaceae) to grasslands, forests, and even urban landscapes. They are further divided into monocots (clade Monocotyledonae) and eudicots (clade Eudicotyledonae), distinguished by differences in their embryonic structure and morphological features. However, some angiosperms do not fall under these two categories and are classified into other groups, such as basal angiosperms (e.g., water lilies) and magnoliids (e.g., avocado and black pepper), which have unique characteristics that set them apart from monocots and eudicots. Monocots have one cotyledon (seed leaf) in their embryos, with stem vascular bundles scattered throughout. Their leaves typically exhibit parallel veins (parallel leaf venation), they possess a fibrous root system, and their floral parts are usually arranged in multiples of three. Monocots thrive in a variety of habitats, including wetlands, grasslands, and tropical areas. They encompass a diverse group of plants, including many grasses, orchids, bamboos, palms, and lilies. They also feature numerous ornamental flowers, and a wide range of food crops. Examples of monocots include Triticum (wheat), Zea mays (maize), Oryza sativa (rice), Musa (bananas), Allium cepa (onions), Phoenix dactylifera (date palms), and Cocos nucifera (coconut). In contrast, dicots possess two cotyledons in their embryos, with stem vascular bundles arranged in a ring. Their leaves typically feature branching veins (net-like leaf venation), they have a taproot system, and their floral parts are usually arranged in multiples of four or five. Note that the old classification of “dicot” has since been divided into basal angiosperms, magnoliids, and eudicots, the latter also referred to as “true” dicots. Eudicots comprise about 75% of all flowering plants and are evolutionarily related, distinguished from other flowering plants by the grooved tricolpate structure of their pollen. In contrast, other angiosperm groups produce monosulcate pollen with a single pore set in a different orientation. Some botanists prefer to call eudicots “tricolpates” to avoid confusion with the old dicot classification, but we will refer to them as eudicots here. The eudicots dominate temperate forests, meadows, and cultivated lands. They include most shrubs and leafy trees, as well as carnivorous plants, many ornamental flowers, and a wide range of food crops, including most fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Examples of eudicots include Solanum lycopersicum (tomatoes), Pisum sativum (peas), Rosa (roses), Quercus (oak trees), Helianthus annuus (sunflowers), Phaseolus vulgaris (common beans), Hibiscus (hibiscus), Malus domestica (apples), coffee (Coffea), pumpkins (Cucurbita), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus), oranges (Citrus), morning glories (Ipomoea), cacti (family Cactaceae), and cherries (Prunus avium). Both gymnosperms and angiosperms share the fundamental process of fertilisation, relying on pollination to transport pollen to the female reproductive structures. In both groups, the pollen germinates, forming a pollen tube that delivers sperm cells to the egg. However, significant differences exist. In gymnosperms, fertilisation occurs directly within exposed ovules on the scales of cones. This leads to the development of seeds without any surrounding fruit or nut. Conversely, angiosperms exhibit a more complex process. Fertilisation takes place within the enclosed ovary of the flower, ultimately resulting in seeds encased within the mature fruit. Furthermore, gymnosperms typically undergo a single fertilisation event, where a sperm cell unites with the egg to form the zygote. Angiosperms, on the other hand, exhibit a unique phenomenon known as double fertilisation. In this process, one sperm cell fertilises the egg, while the other fuses with two polar nuclei within the ovule, giving rise to the triploid endosperm, a specialised tissue that provides nourishment for the developing embryo. In summary, the diversity and complexity of plants within Plantae reflects their evolutionary adaptations to various environments. Vascular plants excel in resource transportation and structural support, enabling survival in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Nonvascular plants adapt to moisture-rich areas where diffusion suffices for nutrient uptake. Seed production, whether exposed or enclosed, illustrates the advancements in reproductive strategies to ensure survival in changing climates and habitats. Video137.Gymnosperms.mp4. Video138.Angiosperms.mp4. Video139.Monocots_and_Eudicots.mp4. Video140.Plants_Diversity_Structure_&_Adaptations.mp4. Generally, from what we have covered so far, it is evident that each level of biological organisation possesses unique characteristics that distinguish it from others while also exhibiting inherent variability within itself. This diversity and complexity underscore the importance of species identification in understanding biological processes and ecological interactions. The identification process employs various techniques, with simple identification keys serving as a fundamental tool. Simple keys are invaluable for both professional biologists and amateur naturalists, providing a structured and logical approach to identification that is accessible even to those with limited taxonomic expertise. However, accurate use of a simple key requires careful observation and a thorough understanding of the relevant terminology. Simple keys, or dichotomous keys, guide users through a series of choices based primarily on observable traits, such as leaf shape, flower colour, body structure, behavioural characteristics, or even geographical distribution, ultimately leading to the correct species identification. They typically employ a structured series of paired statements, known as couplets, to guide users through a decision-making process for species identification. Each couplet offers two mutually exclusive options based on a contrasting characteristic of the organism(s). By carefully observing the specimen(s) and selecting the option that best matches its (or their) traits, the user advances through successive couplets. Each step progressively narrows the choices, ultimately leading to a conclusive identification of the species. For accuracy, the key must maintain a logical structure, systematically eliminating the alternative option at every step. Note that the number of couplets required to identify multiple organisms is typically one less than the total number of organisms (n-1). For instance, identifying five organisms would require four (5-1) couplets. It is also customary to use three dots (ellipses), neither less nor more, before directing the user to the next couplet, such as “..go to 2.” Additionally, users must adhere to the designated labels assigned to each specimen; for example, if a bean plant is labelled as Specimen A, it should be referred to as Specimen A throughout the identification process, rather than by its common name. In addition to simple keys, other methods include molecular techniques like DNA barcoding, which compares genetic material to known species, offering precise identification even for cryptic species that are morphologically similar. Field guides, which provide photographs and descriptions, are also valuable for quick identification in the field. Furthermore, ecological context, such as the habitat or geographic location of the organism, can aid in narrowing down potential species. Ultimately, combining these approaches enhances the accuracy of species identification and deepens our understanding of biodiversity. Video141.Dichotomous_keys.mp4. • In groups, research on the common characteristics and differences between examples of members of the kingdom Plantae belonging to the following categories: vascular/non-vascular, angiosperms/gymnosperms, monocots/dicots. Choose the format to use to present your findings (tables, drawings or more creative methods). • Construct simple keys to place plants in the correct category. [Assignment 6] {Identify three characteristics (cell structure, mode of feeding, and body system) for organisms in kingdom Animalia}. Video146.Introduction_to_zoology.mp4. The kingdom Animalia encompasses a remarkable diversity of organisms, ranging from microscopic invertebrates to large mammals, all distinguished by unique features that define their structure, function, and ecological roles. These features, particularly their cell structure, mode of feeding, and complex body systems, set animals apart from other life forms. Animal cells are eukaryotic, characterised by a true nucleus enclosed by a double membrane, which houses their genetic material (DNA), along with various membrane-bound organelles. Unlike plant and fungal cells, animal cells lack a rigid cell wall, which provides them with greater movement and flexibility in shape. This structural flexibility contributes to the formation of highly specialised tissues and the development of diverse body structures unique to animals. Regarding their mode of feeding, animals are heterotrophic, meaning they rely on other organisms for energy and nutrients. This involves diverse specialised feeding mechanisms, from filter feeding in sponges to complex predatory behaviour in carnivores, followed by internal digestion in organs such as the stomach and intestines. As multicellular organisms, many animals are composed of specialised cells that work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems, facilitating complex biological functions essential for survival. Many animals exhibit highly organised body systems, including a nervous system for detecting and responding to stimuli, a circulatory system for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste products, and a skeletal or muscular system for structure and movement. These interconnected systems enable animals to adapt to diverse environments, occupy various ecological niches, and display behaviours that range from simple to highly complex. However, it is important to note that some of these systems may be absent or less developed in some simpler animals. Together, these characteristics—eukaryotic cell structure, heterotrophic nutrition, and complex organ systems, along with traits such as the ability to move and respond to stimuli—underpin the remarkable diversity and adaptability of animals. These features enable their success in nearly all terrestrial and aquatic habitats, where they play vital roles as consumers and contributors to ecological balance. [Assignment 7] {Give examples of organisms belonging to the following phyla: Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida and Mollusca (No characteristics required)}. The Animal Kingdom encompasses a vast and diverse array of organisms, classified into numerous phyla, each representing a distinct evolutionary lineage. The exact number of phyla remains a topic of debate, with estimates ranging from 29 to 36, reflecting the ongoing refinement of animal classification. As new research and analyses emerge, our understanding of animal phylogeny continues to evolve, leading to necessary revisions in the classification system. This curriculum focuses on six key animal phyla: Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Chordata. To illustrate the broader diversity within the Animal Kingdom, three additional phyla: Porifera, Cnidaria, and Echinodermata, will be briefly explored. Note that animals are broadly classified into two categories: vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates (such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish) form a distinct subphylum, Vertebrata, within the phylum Chordata, characterised by the presence of a vertebral column, or backbone. This defining feature provides vital structural support, enabling vertebrates to achieve greater size and complexity compared to most animals. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord and facilitates the efficient transmission of nerve signals throughout the body. Combined with a well-developed nervous system and specialised organ systems, this advanced skeletal framework has allowed vertebrates to thrive in diverse terrestrial and aquatic environments. The rest of the animal kingdom, encompassing a wide variety of organisms from sponges to insects, is referred to as invertebrates, which lack a vertebral column and exhibit a vast range of body structures and adaptations. It’s estimated that approximately 97% of all animal species are invertebrates. Other key characteristics used in animal classification include symmetry (radial, where any plane passing through the central axis divides the organism into two identical halves, or bilateral, where only one plane divides the organism into two mirror images), germ layer development (diploblastic with two germ layers – ectoderm and endoderm or triploblastic with three germ layers – ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), the presence or absence of a true coelom (a fluid-filled body cavity completely lined by the mesoderm), embryonic development (protostomes, where the mouth generally develops first, or deuterostomes, where the anus generally develops first), and the degree of cephalisation (the concentration of sensory organs and nervous tissues in a distinct head region). Note: The protostome/deuterostome classification primarily applies to bilaterally symmetrical animals with well-defined embryonic development. Video147.Major_Divisions_of_Kingdom_Animalia.mp4. Phylum Porifera (sponges) consists of animals that lack true tissues and organs and generally exhibit asymmetry (irregular body shapes with no defined symmetry), making them unique within the animal kingdom. They possess a porous body structure that allows water to flow through, facilitating filter feeding. Porifera do not develop germ layers, lack a true coelom, and do not exhibit cephalisation, highlighting their simplicity in comparison to more complex phyla. Phylum Cnidaria (cnidarians, such as jellyfish, Hydra, corals, and anemones) comprises diploblastic animals with radial symmetry, meaning any plane through their central axis divides them into two identical halves. They possess stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are used for capturing prey and defense. Cnidarians lack a true coelom and do not exhibit true cephalisation. They have a simple nervous system (nerve net) that allows for basic responses to stimuli, but this network is not concentrated in a head region. Phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms) comprises triploblastic, protostome animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry, enabling more complex movement and cephalisation. Their dorsoventrally flattened bodies are characteristic, facilitating diffusion and movement in moist or aquatic environments. They lack a true coelom, a blood circulatory system, and specialised respiratory structures, relying instead on simple diffusion across their body surface for gas exchange. Their alimentary canal, though branched to maximise surface area for nutrient absorption, lacks an anus. Platyhelminthes are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. The phylum has three main classes: Turbellaria, Trematoda, and Cestoda. Turbellaria, exemplified by Dugesia (planarian), are free-living, ciliated flatworms commonly found in wet soils, freshwater, and marine habitats. While generally harmless, they serve as important indicators of water quality. Trematoda comprises parasitic flatworms such as Fasciola (liver fluke) and Schistosoma (blood fluke), which possess suckers for attachment to their hosts for efficient nutrient absorption. Fasciola infections (fascioliasis) primarily affect livestock such as cows, which serve as intermediate hosts, causing significant liver damage and bile duct obstruction. Fasciola infections can occur in humans through the consumption of contaminated water plants, underscoring the importance of maintaining separate water sources for livestock to prevent transmission. Schistosoma infections (schistosomiasis) pose a serious threat to human health, leading to severe organ damage, chronic inflammation, and anaemia. Finally, Cestoda includes various genera of tapeworms, such as Taenia, Echinococcus, and Hymenolepis, parasitic flatworms with segmented bodies (proglottids), hooks, and suckers to attach to the gut of hosts like humans and livestock, where they absorb nutrients directly. Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) can cause taeniasis, leading gastrointestinal discomfort, and in severe cases, cysticercosis, where the larvae invade tissues and lead to neurological complications. Similarly, Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) can also cause taeniasis, emphasising the importance of thoroughly cooking meat to prevent these parasitic infections. Phylum Nematoda (roundworms) comprises triploblastic, protostome animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry, enabling cephalisation and more complex movement. They possess a pseudocoelom (a body cavity not fully lined by mesoderm) which serves as a hydrostatic skeleton, allowing for efficient locomotion. They exhibit elongated, cylindrical bodies tapered at both ends and possess a complete digestive system with both a mouth and anus. While lacking a closed circulatory system, the pseudocoelom aids in the distribution of nutrients. Nematodes do not have segmented bodies, and gaseous exchange occurs across their entire body surface. They can be free-living or parasitic, residing in various environments. Parasitic nematodes can cause significant health issues in humans and animals, highlighting their impact on global health and socioeconomic development. Notable examples of parasitic nematodes include Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), Necator americanus (hookworm), Ascaris lumbricoides (a large roundworm), Dracunculus medinensis (guinea worm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), and Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm). Among free-living nematodes, Caenorhabditis elegans is a crucial model organism in genetics and developmental biology research, valued for its simple anatomy, transparent body, and rapid life cycle. Phylum Annelida (segmented worms) comprises triploblastic, protostome animals that exhibit bilateral symmetry, enabling cephalisation. They possess a true coelom divided into segments, a feature that enhances body structure complexity and mobility. Movement is facilitated by specialised structures such as setae, which are bristle-like appendages providing traction and aiding locomotion. Annelids possess a closed circulatory system and a complete digestive system with both a mouth and an anus. While many annelids respire through their skin, some possess specialised respiratory organs. Most of them are hermaphrodites, possessing both male and female reproductive organs, although cross-fertilisation is common. They exhibit a wide range of feeding habits, including predation, herbivory, and parasitism. Annelids encompass a diverse group that includes earthworms, leeches, and marine worms. Specific examples include Lumbricus terrestris (common earthworm), which enhances soil health by improving soil aeration and nutrient cycling; Hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech), known for its blood-feeding parasitic lifestyle and historical use in medicine; Nereis virens (a type of bristle worm), a marine annelid characterised by its bristly appendages, found in various ocean habitats; the ragworm (Alitta virens), a predatory marine annelid often used as bait in fishing; the lugworm (Arenicola marina), which burrows into sandy shores and plays a crucial role in sediment turnover; and the polychaete Eunice aphroditois (bobbit worm), a large marine predator known for its sudden ambushes. Phylum Mollusca (molluscs) comprises triploblastic, protostome animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry. They possess a true coelom and are characterised by their soft, unsegmented bodies, often protected by a hard shell made of calcium carbonate. Their bodies are organised into three main parts: the head-foot (used for locomotion and sensory functions), visceral mass (which houses the internal organs), and mantle (which secretes the shell). Many molluscs have a radula which is a tongue-like structure, used to scrape or rasp food. Mollusca display a range of cephalisation, from highly developed nervous systems of cephalopods (subphylum Cephalopoda) to simpler systems of bivalves (subphylum Bivalvia). Cephalopods are notable for their general lack of external shells and their high degree of cephalisation, featuring advanced nervous systems that enable complex behaviours, such as problem-solving, camouflage, and sophisticated communication. For example, octopuses are known for their intelligence and ability to manipulate objects in their environment, while squids possess a streamlined body and are capable of rapid movement through jet propulsion. Other examples of molluscs include gastropods (snails, slugs) and bivalves (clams, oysters, mussels), with specific examples including Octopus vulgaris (common octopus), Mytilus (blue mussel), and Helix (garden snail). Phylum Arthropoda (arthropods) is the most diverse phylum, characterised by animals with a segmented body, jointed appendages, and an exoskeleton made of chitin. Arthropods, which include insects, crustaceans, and arachnids, are triploblastic, protostome animals exhibiting bilateral symmetry. They possess a true coelom and exhibit varying degrees of cephalisation. Complex nervous systems are particularly evident in insects such as Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and arachnids like Achaearanea tepidariorum (common spider). Phylum Echinodermata encompasses a diverse array of marine invertebrates, including starfish (sea stars), sea cucumbers, and sea urchins. These echinoderms are triploblastic deuterostomes, meaning their anus develops from the blastopore during embryonic development. They generally exhibit radial symmetry as adults, typically characterised by pentaradial (five-part) symmetry, while their larvae generally exhibit bilateral symmetry. Unlike many other phyla, echinoderms lack cephalisation, as they do not possess a distinct head region, relying instead on a decentralised nervous system for sensory and motor functions. They possess a true coelom and a unique water vascular system used for movement and feeding. Although they exhibit minimal cephalisation, their remarkable ability to regenerate lost body parts showcases their adaptive nature. For instance, sea stars can regenerate lost arms, and certain species can even regenerate their central disc. Some echinoderms can even reproduce asexually from that lost part.  Phylum Chordata (chordates) is characterised by five key features: a notochord (a flexible rod-like structure providing support, present in all chordates at some stage), a dorsal hollow nerve cord (a single, hollow nerve cord located along the back of the animal), pharyngeal slits or pouches (openings in the pharynx that function in filter feeding in some chordates and have been modified for other purposes in others e.g., gills in fish), a post-anal tail (a tail that extends beyond the anus, present at some stage in development), and an endostyle (a groove in invertebrate chordates that produces mucus for filter feeding and iodine storage) or a thyroid gland (in vertebrates, involved in metabolism and iodine regulation). Chordates, including vertebrates and some invertebrates (e.g., Amphioxus), are triploblastic deuterostomes that exhibit bilateral symmetry and possess a true coelom. Cephalisation is highly pronounced in vertebrates like Homo sapiens (humans) and Canis lupus (wolf), which have complex nervous systems. While not as externally apparent as in annelids and insects, segmentation is a fundamental aspect of chordate development and body plan organisation, evident in the formation of somites (blocks of mesoderm that develop into vertebrae, muscle, and dermis) during embryogenesis. These selected phyla—Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and Chordata—demonstrate the incredible diversity of body plans and evolutionary adaptations that have arisen within the Animal Kingdom, showcasing the remarkable range of forms and functions exhibited by these fascinating organisms. Video148.A_Tour_of_9_Animal_Phyla.mp4. [Assignment 8] {Identify and describe the common observable characteristics and give examples of organisms from phyla Arthropoda including its classes (No drawings required)}. Phylum Arthropoda gets its name from the Ancient Greek words: “arthron” meaning joint, and “pous” meaning foot. So, they are the “jointed foot animals”, and they are the largest and most diverse animal phylum, containing about 80 to 85% of all described animal species. Globally, new arthropod species are being described almost every day, highlighting the incredible biodiversity of this successful animal group. While some pose significant threats to human health by transmitting diseases or damaging crops, others play crucial roles in ecosystems, including pollinating plants, decomposing organic matter, and serving as a vital food source for other animals, including humans. This group is characterised by high reproductive potential, with rapid growth and high fecundity (the ability to produce an abundance of offspring) that enable swift population growth. Additionally, many arthropods undergo metamorphosis, a developmental process that allows them to occupy different ecological niches at various life stages, further enhancing their adaptability and success. Most species of arthropods are dioecious, meaning they have distinct male and female individuals, each exhibiting paired reproductive organs and internal fertilisation. All arthropods have a complete digestive system, a complex muscular system, and an open circulatory system with a dorsal contractile heart, arteries, and haemocoel, which is a reduced coelom that occupies most of the body cavity and is usually filled with haemolymph. Their nervous system is similar to that of the annelids, with a dorsal brain connected to a ring around the gullet and ventral nerve cords. They have numerous well-adapted sensory organs which can differ greatly by taxon. Most possess compound eyes with complex photoreceptors, often accompanied by simple eyes (ocelli). Some species have only compound eyes, while some rely solely on simple eyes. Many are capable of complex behavioural patterns, and quite a few species are capable of extremely complex social organisation. They also have a wide range of respiratory systems, including gills, book lungs, and complex tracheal systems. Most terrestrial arthropods pipe air directly to cells through a highly efficient tracheal system, that opens to the outside world through a series of spiracles, which are often located on the sides of their body. However, arthropods are most easily distinguished from other animal phyla due to their jointed appendages, segmented bodies, and an exoskeleton made of chitin. The jointed appendages, allow for a wide range of movements and are highly adaptable, modified for diverse functions like walking, swimming, feeding, and sensory perception. Many species possess hollow limbs equipped with sensory hairs, which enhance their sensory perception and environmental awareness. The limbs of many species are essentially hollow levers moved by internal muscles and pressure, and are often covered in sensory hairs, which enhance their sensory perception and environmental awareness. Segmentation provides flexibility and allows for specialisation of body regions across the arthropod subphyla. These segments often fuse into functional groups called tagmata (commonly referred to as body parts), which serve specialised purposes. The cuticular exoskeleton provides support, protection from mechanical injury, and a point of attachment for muscles while also preventing desiccation by secreting wax. This tough, external covering composed of chitin, a fairly firm but flexible carbohydrate, is often reinforced with proteins, lipids, and minerals like calcium carbonate. In order to grow in size, arthropods must periodically shed or moult their old exoskeleton. These characteristics have earned the arthropods the nickname of the “Swiss Army Knives” of the animal kingdom, reflecting their incredible adaptability. This versatility has enabled arthropods to thrive in nearly every habitat on Earth, from the depths of oceanic vents to the summits of the highest mountains. To reiterate, in addition to jointed appendages, the six attributes  most often associated with arthropod success are: exoskeletons, segmentation, the tracheal system,  sensory organs, complex behaviours, and metamorphosis. The phylum Arthropoda is divided into several subphyla, each containing distinct classes with observable traits and representative organisms. Video149.Phylum_Arthropoda.mp4. Subphylum Trilobitomorpha, includes extinct trilobites, representing a significant evolutionary milestone with its segmented body and biramous appendages. Subphylum Chelicerata includes classes such as Arachnida, which inhabit diverse terrestrial environments, ranging from forests and deserts to caves and human dwellings. Arachnids are characterised by four pairs of legs, the absence of antennae, simple eyes, specialised mouthparts called chelicerae (jaw-like appendages located near the mouth, often used for grasping, piercing, or injecting venom), and two body parts: the cephalothorax or prosoma (fused head and thorax) and the opisthosoma or abdomen. They lack wings too but possess specialised structures, such as pedipalps, which aid in sensory perception, defense, prey capture, or reproduction. Many arachnids also utilise venom, delivered through their chelicerae or stingers (sharp, pointed appendages often located at the end of the abdomen, as in scorpions), to immobilise prey or deter predators. Gaseous exchange occurs through book lungs (stacked, plate-like structures on the surface of the abdomen) or tracheae, ensuring efficient oxygen uptake in their terrestrial habitats. Examples of arachnids include spiders (Araneus diadematus), scorpions (Pandinus imperator), ticks (Ixodes scapularis), and mites (Tetranychus urticae). Arachnids exhibit varied modes of feeding, with most being carnivorous, preying on insects or small animals, while some, like mites, are detritivores or parasitic. Spiders are equipped with spinnerets, specialised appendages located at the rear of the abdomen. Spinnerets produce silk, which spiders use for various purposes, including building webs for trapping prey, creating egg sacs, and constructing shelters. In addition to Arachnida, Chelicerata also includes the class Xiphosura, which contains the horseshoe crabs. These marine chelicerates, such as the Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), are characterised by a hard, horseshoe-shaped carapace, long telson (tail spine), and book gills. Horseshoe crabs are often considered "living fossils" due to their ancient lineage and minimal evolutionary changes over millions of years. Subphylum Myriapoda comprises the classes Chilopoda (centipedes) and Diplopoda (millipedes). Myriapods possess a distinct head with a pair of antennae, simple eyes, and mandibles for feeding. They utilise a tracheal system for efficient gas exchange, and their elongated bodies, composed of numerous segments, allow for effective movement through soil and leaf litter. Chilopods, such as Scolopendra gigantea (the giant centipede), are carnivorous arthropods. They possess a pair of venomous claws for prey capture and primarily feed on insects, other invertebrates, and sometimes small vertebrates. Each body segment bears a single pair of legs, and their elongated, dorso-ventrally flattened bodies are well-suited for movement in confined spaces. Diplopods, such as Glomeris marginata (pill millipede), are characterised by a long, cylindrical body composed of numerous segments. Each segment typically bears two pairs of legs, giving them their distinctive appearance. Many millipedes, particularly pill millipedes, can coil their bodies into a tight ball when disturbed or not active, providing protection from predators. Millipedes are primarily detritivores (decomposers), feeding on decaying plant matter and playing an important role in soil decomposition. Subphylum Crustacea, primarily aquatic, includes the class Malacostraca, a diverse group encompassing a wide range of organisms. Notable examples of malacostracans include crabs, such as the European green crab (Carcinus maenas); crayfish, such as the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus); lobsters, such as the American lobster (Homarus americanus); shrimps, such as the giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon); and isopods, such as the common woodlouse (Oniscus asellus). Crustaceans exhibit a diverse body plan, typically with three main parts: the head, bearing two pairs of antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and mouthparts; the thorax, typically bearing walking legs; and the abdomen, often bearing swimmerets for swimming and terminating in a fan-like tail (telson). In many crustaceans, the head and thorax are fused to form a cephalothorax, which is often covered by a single large hard outer shell, known as a carapace. Respiration typically occurs through gills. Another notable class within Crustacea is Maxillopoda, which includes barnacles (sub class Thecostraca). Barnacles are sessile crustaceans that attach to surfaces such as rocks, ship hulls, or other marine organisms. They are encased in a hard calcareous shell and utilise specialised appendages called cirri to filter-feed on plankton and organic particles suspended in the water. An example of a barnacle species is the acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula). While many crustaceans possess specialised appendages for locomotion (such as swimmerets), feeding (such as mandibles and maxillipeds adapted for capturing, manipulating, and processing food), and other functions (including sensory perception, defence, and reproduction), this is not a universal trait across the entire subphylum. Subphylum Hexapoda, which includes the class Insecta, represents the most diverse group within Arthropoda. Insects exhibit three body parts (head, thorax, abdomen), three pairs of legs (one pair per thoracic segment), and usually one or two pairs of wings on the second and/or the third segment of the thorax, enabling flight in many species. Halteres, modified hindwings found in flies, function as gyroscopic organs, aiding in flight stabilisation and balance. During flight, halteres vibrate rapidly, providing sensory feedback to the insect's nervous system about its orientation and movements in the three-dimensional space. This allows flies to perform complex aerial manoeuvres with remarkable agility and precision. While flight is a significant characteristic of many insects, it's not unique to them. Other flying animals include bats, which are mammals, and some species of birds. Wingless insects, such as ants, termites, and certain species of beetles, have adapted to their environments in various ways, often relying on their strong legs for movement and their ability to burrow or hide to evade predators. Insects generally have a pair of compound eyes, providing them with a wide field of vision to detect food and threats, often accompanied by simple eyes (ocelli) that are sensitive to light. They also typically possess a pair of antennae, which are sensory organs that help detect chemicals, sounds, and vibrations in their environment. Adaptations in mouthparts allow insects to exploit a wide range of food sources, reducing competition. For example, chewing mouthparts (e.g., mandibles in grasshoppers and beetles) are adapted for biting and chewing plant material; piercing-sucking mouthparts (e.g., stylets in mosquitoes and aphids) are adapted for piercing plant or animal tissues and sucking fluids; and siphoning mouthparts (e.g., the proboscis in butterflies and moths) are adapted for sucking nectar from flowers. Their small size allows for exploitation of diverse microhabitats, reduced resource requirements, and increased agility. Additionally, variable body shapes, such as the dorsal-ventrally flattened bodies of cockroaches, facilitate movement in narrow pathways and crevices. Insects excrete waste products like uric acid, which conserves water. They breathe by means of spiracles and carry out gas exchange in the tracheal system. Their tracheal system allows for efficient gaseous exchange, supporting their metabolic needs. Insects have a high reproductive rate, often laying many eggs at once. This strategy ensures that even if some eggs are destroyed, enough offspring survive to reach adulthood. They undergo complete or incomplete metamorphosis. Complete metamorphosis allows for distinct larval and adult stages, reducing competition for resources and enabling specialisation. For example, adult butterflies feed on nectar, while caterpillars consume plant leaves, reducing competition for resources. Their short life cycles further contribute to rapid population increases. Insect diversity encompasses a wide range of feeding habits, including carnivory (e.g., praying mantises), herbivory (e.g., grasshoppers), and parasitism (e.g., fleas, ticks, some wasps, and some flies). Many insects exhibit a variety of colours for camouflage, while others possess markings that mimic aggressive or warning appearances to deter predators, such as the false eyes on butterfly wings. Insects exhibit a remarkable degree of social organisation, particularly evident in species like ants, bees, and termites, where complex societies with division of labour and cooperative behaviours are observed. Insects are the most successful animals on Earth, inhabiting diverse terrestrial and aquatic environments, due to a combination of factors including flight, a robust exoskeleton, small size, high reproductive capacity, diverse feeding habits, sensory adaptations, and the ability to undergo metamorphosis, all of which contribute to their remarkable ecological success. They play crucial roles in ecosystems, acting as pollinators, decomposers, and a food source for other animals, while contributing to scientific research. However, insects can also be detrimental, causing crop damage, transmitting diseases, and acting as pests in homes and businesses.

[Assignment 9] {Identify and describe the common observable characteristics (types of teeth, temperature regulation, habitat, reproduction, and gas exchange) and give examples of organisms from the phylum Chordata and its classes. No details of the reproduction process should be given}. The phylum Chordata is divided into three subphyla: Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Urochordata, or tunicates, are marine animals such as sea squirts, characterised by a notochord present only in the larval stage. Cephalochordata, represented by lancelets like Branchiostoma, retain the notochord throughout life and are small, fish-like marine organisms. Vertebrata, the largest subphylum, includes animals with a vertebral column, or backbone. This crucial structure provides vital support, protects the spinal cord, and facilitates a wide range of movement. The subphylum Vertebrata, encompassing Pisces (fish) and tetrapods, is broadly classified into two main groups: Agnatha (jawless vertebrates) and Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Agnatha includes class Cyclostomata, which comprises jawless fish such as lampreys and hagfish. Gnathostomata divides into jawed fish and tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates). Jawed fish encompass classes Placodermi (extinct), Chondrichthyes, and Osteichthyes. Chondrichthyes, also known as Elasmobranchs, including sharks, skates, and rays, are fish with cartilaginous skeletons. Osteichthyes, also known as bony fish, are a diverse class of vertebrates characterised by skeletons primarily composed of bone. This class includes the sub-class Actinopterygii (the ray-finned fish), which encompasses a wide variety of species such as the Nile perch, tilapia, herring, silver cyprinid (mukene), and salmon. Many bony fish belong to the Teleost group, distinguished by advanced features like a highly mobile jaw, specialised fin structures, and a swim bladder for buoyancy control. Tetrapods comprise classes Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia, marking a significant evolutionary transition to life on land. Amphibians, such as frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders, are dual-life animals adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Reptiles, including crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and turtles, are primarily terrestrial vertebrates with scales and internal fertilisation. Aves (birds), such as pigeons and eagles, are characterised by feathers, beaks, and adaptations for flight, although some, like penguins, are flightless and have evolved adaptations for swimming instead. Finally, class Mammalia, divided into three subclasses (Monotrema, Metatheria, and Eutheria), exhibits hair or fur, mammary glands for feeding young. Monotrema includes egg-laying mammals such as the spiny anteater (echidna) and the duck-billed platypus. Metatheria comprises marsupials that carry their immature young in a pouch for continued development, including kangaroos, wallabies, and koalas. Eutheria encompasses placental mammals that give birth to fully developed young and nurse them using mammary glands, with examples including humans, rats, cows, goats, polar bears and whales. This remarkable diversity within the phylum Chordata highlights the evolutionary adaptations that enable members to thrive in various ecological niches. Teeth types vary widely among chordates, reflecting adaptations to different diets and lifestyles. Mammals typically exhibit heterodont dentition, featuring specialised teeth such as incisors for biting, canines for tearing, and premolars and molars for crushing and grinding. However, exceptions exist; for example, some mammals, like anteaters, lack teeth entirely. Reptiles generally display homodont dentition, where teeth are uniform in shape and primarily adapted for gripping prey, though some reptiles, like certain snakes, have specialised fangs for venom delivery. Birds lack teeth but possess sharp beaks uniquely adapted to their dietary needs, with some species, like geese, having serrated edges on their beaks for cutting vegetation. Fish often exhibit polyphyodont dentition, characterised by continuous tooth replacement, though exceptions like the parrotfish show specialised beak-like structures for scraping coral. Temperature regulation (thermoregulation) varies significantly among chordates. Mammals and birds are endothermic ("warm-blooded"), relying on metabolic heat production to maintain a constant internal body temperature regardless of environmental fluctuations. They are also classified as homeotherms, meaning their body temperature remains relatively stable. In contrast, amphibians, reptiles, and most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), relying on external heat sources such as sunlight or warm rocks to regulate their body temperature, and poikilotherms, meaning their body temperature fluctuates with the surrounding environment. However, exceptions exist; some fish, such as certain species of sharks and tuna, exhibit regional endothermy, maintaining elevated temperatures in specific body regions to enhance muscle activity or sensory functions. Similarly, certain reptiles, like leatherback sea turtles, can retain body heat to survive in cooler waters, blurring the distinction between ectothermic and endothermic strategies. Habitats among chordates span a wide range of environments. Fish are predominantly aquatic, thriving in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Amphibians typically transition between aquatic and terrestrial habitats during their life cycle, with larvae living in water and adults often venturing onto land. Reptiles are primarily terrestrial but can also inhabit aquatic environments, as seen in turtles and crocodiles. Birds are highly adaptable, occupying terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments, with specialised traits suited to their ecological niches. Mammals exhibit extraordinary adaptability, occupying a vast array of habitats, from the frozen expanses of arctic tundras and dense, humid forests to the scorching deserts and sprawling savannas. Notable exceptions include marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and seals, which are fully aquatic and have evolved specialised adaptations for life in water, including streamlined bodies and modified limbs for swimming. Reproduction among chordates exhibits remarkable diversity, primarily involving sexual methods with varying fertilisation and developmental strategies. Internal fertilisation is common in mammals, reptiles, and birds, whereas external fertilisation is prevalent among amphibians and many fish. Developmental strategies also vary: oviparity, where eggs are laid and develop outside the body, is seen in birds, reptiles, and most fish; viviparity, where young develop within the mother and are born live, is typical of most mammals; and ovoviviparity, where eggs develop and hatch within the mother before live birth, occurs in certain reptiles and fish, such as some species of sharks and rays. Exceptions exist, such as monotreme mammals like platypuses and echidnas, which are oviparous, laying eggs despite being mammals. Lastly, gas exchange mechanisms in chordates are finely tuned to their lifestyles and environments. Fish use gills equipped with lamellae, specialised structures that maximise the extraction of dissolved oxygen from water. Amphibians employ diverse strategies, including cutaneous respiration through their moist skin and pulmonary respiration via lungs, varying with life stage and habitat. Reptiles primarily rely on lungs, which are simpler than those of birds and mammals but adequate for their energy requirements. Birds have a highly efficient system combining lungs and air sacs, allowing continuous airflow and optimised oxygen exchange, especially during flight. Mammals possess lungs with alveoli, finely adapted to meet the high oxygen demands of their active metabolisms.
