[Assignment 1] {Distinguish between the terms ‘growth’ and ‘development’}. Growth is a characteristic feature of all living organisms. It refers to the irreversible increase in size and dry weight of an organism, involving measurable changes such as height, weight, or volume. For instance, a child growing taller with age exemplifies an increase in physical size. In multicellular organisms, growth occurs in three phases: cell division, where the number of cells increases through mitosis; cell expansion, characterised by a permanent increase in cell size due to water uptake or synthesis of living materials; and cell differentiation, where cells specialise to perform specific functions. Growth is primarily a quantitative process, but it is often accompanied by development, which involves qualitative changes in an organism, including the progression and improvement of functional abilities, organisation, and complexity. Development includes the maturation and specialisation of structures and functions, such as organ development, refinement of motor skills, and cognitive advancements. While growth and development are distinct, they are interconnected processes that collectively drive the physical, functional, and behavioural transformation of an organism throughout its lifecycle. In plants, growth is a continuous process primarily occurring at the tips of the root and shoot systems, regions known as meristems. A meristem consists of a group of undifferentiated plant cells capable of repeated division through mitosis. There are two main types of meristems: apical meristems, located at the tips of roots and shoots, which promote an increase in length or height of the plant, a process known as primary growth; and lateral meristems, situated laterally in the stems and roots of dicot plants, responsible for secondary growth that follows primary growth. Secondary growth, or secondary thickening, involves an increase in the girth or thickness of the plant. Lateral meristems are further classified into two types: cork cambium, which forms the secondary cortex, and vascular cambium, which gives rise to secondary phloem and xylem tissues. Together, these meristematic tissues play a crucial role in the overall growth and structural development of plants. In most animals, growth occurs throughout the body of the organism, unlike in plants, where it is localised in specific areas known as meristems. Most animals exhibit continuous growth, continuing to increase in size until they reach maturity. However, in arthropods, such as insects, growth is discontinuous, characterised by distinct periods of growth followed by phases of no growth. Insects have an exoskeleton which is rigid and prevents expansion of the insect during growth. Before the insect grows, it sheds the exoskeleton in a process called moulting (ecdysis). Without the exoskeleton, the insect expands and grows. A new exoskeleton then forms and growth ceases. This kind of growth is referred to as intermittent growth or discontinuous growth. Successive moults result in the formation of a new form of the insect, a process known as metamorphosis, which will be discussed in the next chapter. A graph showing intermittent growth in insects. Figure346.growth_in_plants_and_animals_346.jpg. Growth in organisms is influenced by a variety of factors, which can be broadly categorised into genetic, environmental, nutritional, and hormonal factors. Genetic factors, inherited from parents, provide the blueprint for growth, determining traits such as potential height, body structure, and the rate of growth. Genes control the size, shape, and overall growth patterns of an organism, ensuring that it follows a predetermined developmental trajectory. Nutritional factors are crucial, as nutrients are used to build new protoplasm and organic matter, while their oxidation provides energy required for cellular activities. A lack of essential nutrients can result in stunted growth or even death. Environmental factors such as light, temperature, pH, and the accumulation of metabolic by-products also play significant roles. Light, particularly in plants, affects growth by influencing photosynthesis, where higher light intensity typically promotes growth. Temperature impacts enzymatic activities that drive biochemical reactions, with growth increasing as temperature rises to an optimum, beyond which enzymes become denatured, and growth slows. Similarly, pH affects enzyme activity, with deviations from optimal pH leading to reduced growth. In animals, the accumulation of metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide, can inhibit growth due to their toxic effects on body cells. In contrast, in plants, carbon dioxide serves as a raw material for photosynthesis, where its availability directly enhances growth. Hormonal factors regulate growth by controlling physiological processes. In animals, growth hormones, such as somatotropin and thyroxin, stimulate cell division and protein synthesis, thereby promoting growth. In plants, hormones such as auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins drive processes like cell elongation, division, and differentiation. Together, these hormones coordinate growth across tissues and organs. This interplay of internal and external factors ensures that growth is a dynamic, regulated process, but disruptions in any one factor can significantly alter growth patterns. The growth curve is a graphical representation of how an organism or a population grows over time, typically depicted as a logistic or sigmoid (S-shaped) growth curve. Figure345.growth_in_plants_and_animals_345.jpg. For individual organisms, the curve includes four distinct phases: the lag phase, characterised by slow growth as the organism acclimates to its environment, resulting in minimal cell division; the exponential (log) phase, where rapid growth occurs due to favourable conditions and abundant resources, leading to significant increases in cell division; the decelerating (transitional) growth phase, where growth slows as competition for resources—such as food and space—intensifies, and the organism may be preparing for reproduction or aging; and the plateau (stationary) phase, where growth levels off as the organism reaches its maximum potential size, resulting in a balance between the rate of new cells produced and cells dying. In contrast, the growth curve for populations also comprises these four phases but focuses on the collective dynamics of a group of organisms. In the lag phase, the population grows slowly due to a low number of individuals, leading to minimal reproductive success. During the exponential phase, the population expands rapidly as conditions improve and resources are abundant, resulting in exponential growth. The decelerating growth phase in populations occurs as competition for limited resources increases, and factors such as predation, disease, and environmental limitations start to affect growth rates. Finally, in the plateau phase, the population stabilises as it reaches the environment's carrying capacity, where birth rates equal death rates, resulting in no net change in population size. Note: After the plateau phase, growth may decelerate in seasonal organisms and their populations due to factors such as aging and dispersal, while perennial organisms and their populations can continue to grow continuously by utilising adaptive strategies that enable them to thrive over multiple seasons. Also note that if growth is measured over a specific time frame rather than the entire lifetime of the organism, the graph may not display the classic S-shape. Instead, shorter measurement periods can show varying growth patterns influenced by environmental conditions, resource availability, and the specific developmental stage of the organism, potentially appearing exponential initially and later stabilising or declining. Understanding these growth curves is essential for comprehending the dynamics of both individual organisms and populations, as well as the ecological principles governing their interactions within ecosystems. In particular, growth curves from babies' growth cards represent various parameters, including weight, height, and head circumference, depending on the data being tracked. Persistent deviations from expected percentiles (e.g., below the 5th percentile or above the 95th percentile) for these parameters may indicate issues such as stunted or accelerated growth, reflecting potential underlying health, genetic, or nutritional influences. Recognising the specific parameter being measured is crucial for accurately interpreting growth curves and providing appropriate interventions to support healthy growth and development in infants. For more information on interpreting growth curves, you can refer to resources such as the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) resources on growth charts (https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/index.htm). Figure290.3.8.growth_in_plants_and_animals_image_001.jpg. Video96.Tracking_growth_in_children.mp4. • In groups, examine images of young and mature plants and animals (including some that metamorphose). Discuss and derive the meaning of the terms ‘growth’ and ‘development’, and share conclusions with the class. • In pairs, examine data from growth cards of five babies, draw growth curves and make deductions from the graphs. [Assignment 2] {How does mitosis lead to increase in size and weight in animals}. Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides to produce daughter cells. In unicellular organisms such as amoeba, this process leads to an increase in the number of organisms. In contrast, in multicellular organisms, cell division plays crucial roles in growth, tissue repair, and the formation of reproductive cells (gametes). Understanding key terms related to cell division is essential for grasping the complexities of genetic inheritance and the mechanics of cellular processes. A chromosome is a thread-like structure located within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, containing DNA and carrying the genes of an organism, which encode traits and characteristics. Each chromosome consists of two chromatids, which are identical halves formed during DNA replication. When these chromatids are paired, they are known as sister chromatids, which are crucial for ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical set of genetic material during cell division. On the other hand, homologous chromatids refer to chromatids from different chromosomes that are similar in shape and size and pair up during meiosis, forming a structure known as a bivalent. This pairing is vital for genetic diversity. The centromere is the constricted region of a chromosome where chromatids are attached, playing a crucial role in the separation of chromatids during cell division. At the ends of chromosomes are telomeres, protective caps that prevent the loss of genetic information during replication and play a role in cellular ageing as they progressively shorten with each division. During meiosis, chiasmata are formed at crossing-over points between homologous chromatids, allowing for the exchange of genetic material and increasing genetic variability in gametes. Cells can be classified based on their chromosome number: a haploid cell, such as a gamete, contains half the number of chromosomes compared to the parent cell, ensuring that fertilisation restores the diploid state. In contrast, a diploid cell contains two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. Finally, replication is the biological process by which a cell duplicates its DNA, producing an exact copy of its genetic material, thereby ensuring that each new cell inherits the necessary genetic instructions for functioning and development. This understanding of cell division and its terminology is foundational for studying genetics, developmental biology, and evolutionary processes. The process of cell division begins with the division of the nucleus, a stage known as karyokinesis, followed by the division of the cytoplasm, or cytokinesis. There are two primary types of cell division: mitosis, which is responsible for growth and repair, and meiosis, responsible for the production of gametes, as will be elaborated in Chapter 11.1, Inheritance. In humans, mitosis, a type of cell division occurring in somatic (non-reproductive) cells, primarily takes place in rapidly dividing tissues such as the bone marrow, the lining of the gut, and the Malpighian layer of the epidermis. In plants, mitosis is most active in regions of growth, including the apical meristems and the cambium. During mitosis, a cell replicates its genetic material and divides to produce two genetically identical diploid daughter cells, thereby ensuring the maintenance of the organism's chromosome number. This process allows for an increase in cell number, which directly contributes to the overall size and weight of an organism. For instance, during the growth phases in animals, such as infancy and adolescence, rapid mitotic activity occurs in various tissues, including muscle, fat, and connective tissues, facilitating the increase in body mass. Furthermore, mitosis supports tissue repair and regeneration, allowing organisms to heal wounds and replace damaged cells, thereby maintaining healthy body functions and contributing to overall growth. Additionally, mitosis plays a crucial role in asexual reproduction, as cells divide to form spores or tissues that can develop into new individuals. In bryophytes (mosses), gametes are produced through mitosis, highlighting its importance in both growth and reproduction. The coordination of mitotic activity with other processes, such as nutrient intake and hormonal regulation, ensures that growth remains balanced and efficient, ultimately leading to increased size and weight in animals. Mitosis, a process essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms, consists of four distinct stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Figure291.3.8.growth_in_plants_and_animals_image_002.jpg. Prophase is the first stage of mitosis, during which the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The nucleolus disappears, and the centrosomes, structures that organise microtubules, migrate to opposite poles of the cell. In animal cells, each centrosome contains a pair of centrioles, which play a critical role in organising and anchoring the spindle fibres composed of microtubules. In contrast, plant cells lack centrioles and instead utilise microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) to coordinate the formation of spindle fibres essential for cell division. Prometaphase follows prophase, marking a critical step in karyokinesis—the division of the nucleus. During this stage, the nuclear envelope fully disintegrates, allowing spindle fibres, which are fully formed at this stage, to interact directly with the chromosomes. The spindle fibres attach to kinetochores—specialised protein structures at the centromeres—enabling the chromosomes to undergo guided movement as they begin aligning toward the centre of the cell. During metaphase, chromosomes move to the centre of the cell and align along the metaphase plate (spindle equator), an imaginary line equidistant from the two centrosomes. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that each sister chromatid faces opposite poles of the spindle, facilitating accurate chromosome segregation. The tension exerted by the spindle fibres on the kinetochores ensures that the chromosomes are correctly positioned for separation, allowing each daughter cell to receive an identical set of chromosomes. Anaphase follows, characterised by the division of the centromeres, which allows the sister chromatids of each chromosome to separate and move toward opposite poles of the cell. Each chromatid is now considered an independent chromosome. The spindle fibres shorten, pulling the chromosomes apart, ensuring that each new daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. This separation is essential for maintaining genetic consistency, as errors during this phase can lead to aneuploidy, a condition where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes. In the final stage, telophase, the chromosomes reach the poles and begin to de-condense back into chromatin. The nuclear envelope reappears around each set of separated chromosomes, the nucleolus reappears within each newly formed nucleus, and the mitotic spindle disassembles. Following mitosis, cytokinesis occurs, resulting in the division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, this involves the constriction of the cell membrane to envelop each newly formed nucleus, while in plant cells, a cell wall plate forms. The completion of cytokinesis leads to two distinct daughter cells, each with an identical set of chromosomes and the same genetic material as the original parent cell, thereby completing the cell cycle and preparing the cells for the next interphase. Note that as cells undergo division and differentiation, they may lose their ability to divide further, leading to specialised functions within multicellular organisms. Video97.Mitosis.mp4. Although interphase (the resting stage between cell divisions) is regarded as a resting phase, the cell is actively engaged in several preparations for division. Interphase occupies the majority of the cell cycle, lasting significantly longer than mitosis, as the cell undergoes critical processes such as the replication of genetic material, allowing for sufficient chromosomes for the two daughter cells, the synthesis and storage of energy through respiration in preparation for cell division, and, in cells with centrioles, the replication of these organelles. Video98.The_cell_cycle_and_cancer.mp4. • In groups, role-play the process of mitosis using cards showing the different stages (names of stages not required), and show role play to the class. • In groups or pairs, discuss and explain verbally or in writing, the importance of mitotic cell division in living organisms. [Assignment 3] {Explore the internal and external structure of a seed}. Seeds are fertilised mature ovules that possess a variety of structures, equipping them to survive harsh conditions and ensuring the successful establishment of new plants when conditions are favourable for growth. Figure292.3.8.growth_in_plants_and_animals_image_003.jpg. Externally, seeds typically have a protective outer layer called the seed coat, formed from the integuments, which helps prevent water loss and shields the seed from physical damage and pathogens. The seed coat comprises the testa, a hard and dry protective covering, and the tegmen, the inner membrane of the seed coat that also provides protection. It varies in thickness and texture depending on the species, with notable features including the hilum, a scar marking the point where the seed was attached to the pod inside the fruit, and structures such as wings or hairs that aid in wind dispersal. Additionally, the micropyle is a narrow opening into the seed through which water, mineral salts, and oxygen enter during germination. Surrounding some seeds is the epicarp, the outer layer of the fruit, which may provide an additional layer of protection or aid in seed dispersal. Internally, seeds comprise an embryo, which develops into the new plant, and an endosperm, which stores food—especially starch, proteins, and liquids—for the embryo during germination. The epithelial layer of the seed surrounds the embryo and contributes to its protection and nutrient absorption. Surrounding the endosperm in monocotyledonous seeds is the aleurone layer, a specialised protein-rich layer that plays a vital role in mobilising stored food during germination. The embryo consists of the radicle, located opposite the micropyle (which develops into the primary root), the plumule (which develops into the shoot), and one or two cotyledons that serve as initial leaves and store food. In monocotyledonous seeds, the radicle is enclosed by the coleorhiza, a protective sheath. The plumule is similarly safeguarded by the coleoptile. Additionally, the scutellum, a specialised cotyledon unique to monocots, facilitates the digestion and absorption of nutrients stored in the endosperm, supplying nourishment to the developing embryo. The hypocotyl, the portion of the embryonic axis below the cotyledons, develops into the transition zone between the root and shoot, while the epicotyl, the portion above the cotyledons, gives rise to the shoot system. In some seeds, the cotyledons are swollen, containing stored food for the growing plumule and radicle, and such seeds are referred to as non-endospermic seeds. In contrast, seeds that store their food in the endosperm are called endospermic seeds. A developing root has a root cap, which bores through soil particles and protects the newly formed cells at the root tip from mechanical damage. Based on the number of cotyledons, seeds can be classified into two main types: monocotyledonous seeds, which contain only one cotyledon, such as cereals like maize, and dicotyledonous seeds, which contain two cotyledons, exemplified by legumes like beans, peas, and groundnuts. This comprehensive combination of internal and external structures—including the seed coat, epicarp, aleurone layer, and embryo components—enables seeds to endure challenging conditions, supports germination, and promotes the successful establishment of new plants under favourable conditions. • In pairs, examine a fresh bean and a maize seed (soaked overnight), and: • describe and draw the external features • cut the seeds longitudinally, observe using a hand lens, describe and draw the internal structure. [Assignment 4] {Identify the roles of water, oxygen, and temperature in the process of germination}. Seed germination is the process by which an embryo develops into a seedling capable of independent growth under favourable conditions. It begins when the seed absorbs water from the soil through imbibition, primarily via the micropyle, causing the seed to swell and the testa to soften and split. This water uptake activates enzymes which hydrolyse stored food reserves into soluble products like sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. These substances diffuse into cells, where simple sugars and fats are oxidised to release energy, while amino acids contribute to protoplasm formation. As these nutrients are mobilised, the dry weight of the seed decreases, indicating the use of stored reserves to support growth. The increase in seed size promotes the growth of the radicle and plumule, rupturing the seed coat and enabling the embryo to emerge as a seedling. For germination to occur, external factors like water, oxygen, and suitable temperature are essential, alongside internal conditions such as seed viability, adequate food reserves, active enzymes, and the absence of germination inhibitors (e.g., poisons). Water plays a crucial role in the germination process as it initiates and sustains the metabolic activities within the seed. Through a process called imbibition, water is absorbed by the seed primarily via the micropyle and seed coat, causing the seed to swell and the testa to soften and burst. This swelling allows the embryo to expand, and water activates enzymes like diastase, protease, and lipase, which hydrolyse stored food into soluble forms such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. These soluble substances dissolve in water and are transported to the radicle and plumule, supporting cell division, elongation, and energy production. Water serves as the medium for all enzymatic and chemical reactions in the seed and facilitates the development of cell vacuoles. These vacuoles, by increasing in size, contribute to the enlargement of cells and promote growth. Additionally, water facilitates the transport of hormones like gibberellins, which further regulate germination by stimulating enzyme production. Without sufficient water, these critical processes cannot proceed, and germination halts. Oxygen is vital for aerobic respiration, which provides the energy required for the embryo's growth during germination. Once water activates the seed, stored food reserves undergo oxidation, releasing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Oxygen is absorbed from the surrounding air, typically through the micropyle or other openings in the seed coat. This energy powers essential processes such as cell division, elongation, and differentiation. In oxygen-deficient environments, such as waterlogged or compacted soils, the lack of sufficient aerobic respiration results in reduced energy production, thereby inhibiting germination. Temperature influences the enzymatic activities and metabolic rates that drive germination. Most tropical seeds germinate within a temperature range of 10°C to 50°C. Each seed has an optimal temperature range for germination (typically around 25°C to 30°C), outside of which the process slows down or halts entirely. Within this range, higher temperatures generally increase enzyme activity and metabolic rates, facilitating faster germination, while lower temperatures slow these processes. Extreme temperatures, however, can denature enzymes or cause dormancy, halting germination. Furthermore, temperature affects water absorption and seed coat permeability, both of which are critical for the onset of germination. For seeds with specific temperature requirements, such as cold stratification or heat shock, the appropriate temperature conditions are essential to break dormancy and trigger germination. Therefore, maintaining an optimal temperature is vital for efficient germination. Seed dormancy is a condition in which viable seeds fail to germinate under certain circumstances, representing a resting stage. Several factors contribute to seed dormancy. An immature embryo can prevent germination, as it may require additional development before the process can occur. The presence of germination inhibitors, such as certain acids, can also hinder germination by destroying the enzymes necessary for the process. Extreme temperatures can significantly affect enzyme function—high temperatures can denature enzymes, while low temperatures can inactivate them. Some seeds have a hard, impermeable seed coat that restricts the entry of water and gases, making germination impossible. Dry soil and insufficient oxygen can inhibit germination, as seeds rely on aerobic respiration for energy; in the absence of oxygen, they respire anaerobically, leading to inadequate energy production. To break seed dormancy, various methods can be employed. Harvesting mature seeds allows embryos to develop fully during an after-ripening period. Growth promoters can be applied to deactivate germination inhibitors, providing the necessary nutrients or hormones for proper growth. Exposing seeds to a chilling period can also initiate germination, especially in cereals. Creating suitable conditions of oxygen, temperature, and moisture is essential for successful germination. Removing the hard seed coat can be achieved through methods such as soaking seeds in water, exposing them to fire, passing them through an animal gut, churning in concentrated acids, or physically pricking them. However, seed dormancy plays an important role in ensuring that germination occurs under favourable conditions, improving the chances of seedlings reaching maturity. For instance, seeds dispersed in winter remain dormant during summer, allowing them to germinate when conditions are more suitable. Dormant seeds can be stored for extended periods, and artificial conditions can be applied to break dormancy, facilitating transportation and reducing the risk of seeds being adversely affected by unfavourable environmental conditions. [Assignment 5] {Conduct experiments on conditions necessary for seed germination}. An experiment to demonstrate the conditions necessary for germination: Apparatus: 4 test tubes, cotton wool, seeds, oil and water. Procedure: Arrange four test tubes labelled 1-4. To test tube 1, add moist cotton wool, seeds and leave test tube open. To test tube 2, add dry cotton wool, seeds and leave test tube open. To test tube 3, add seeds, boiled cooled water and a layer of oil. To test tube 4, add seeds, moist cotton wool, ice and leave test tube open. Leave all test tubes for 3 days. Figure341.growth_in_plants_and_animals_341.jpg. Observations: Seeds germinated in only test tube 1 and those in test tubes 2, 3 and 4 did not germinate. Conclusion: Air, water and warmth are necessary for germination. An experiment to show that oxygen is necessary for germination: Apparatus: 2 conical flasks, 2 corks, water, cotton wool, seeds and alkaline pyrogallol. Procedure: Pour some water in one conical flask (B) and some alkaline pyrogallol in another conical flask (A). Tie some seeds in wet cotton wool and suspend the cotton wool in the flasks using a thread. Fix the threads using a cork. Leave the set up for three days. Observation: After a few days, the seeds in flask B germinated while those in flask A did not germinate. Conclusion: Oxygen is necessary for germination. Explanation: Alkaline pyrogallol absorbs oxygen from the air in flask A, preventing the seeds from accessing the oxygen needed for aerobic respiration, which is essential for energy production and growth during germination. An experiment to investigate the effect of temperature on germination: Apparatus: 4 Petri dishes, seeds, filter paper, a thermometer, a water bath, and a heat source. Procedure: Place a damp filter paper in each Petri dish and evenly distribute the same number of seeds on top. Set one dish at a low temperature (10°C), one at an optimal temperature (30°C), one at a warm temperature (40°C), and one at a high temperature (50°C) using a water bath. Monitor the temperature with a thermometer and maintain it throughout the experiment. Observe the seeds for a period of seven days, recording any signs of germination. Observation: After seven days, the seeds in the Petri dish at the optimal temperature (30°C) showed the highest germination rate, while those at the low temperature (10°C) exhibited minimal germination. The seeds at the warm temperature (40°C) showed moderate germination, while those at the high temperature (50°C) had very low germination rates or none at all. Conclusion: Temperature affects the rate of germination, with an optimal range for tropical seeds being crucial for successful germination. Explanation: Most tropical seeds germinate within a temperature range of 10°C to 50°C, with an optimal temperature typically around 25°C to 30°C. This optimal range enhances the activity of enzymes. At temperatures at or below 10°C, enzyme activity slows significantly, reducing metabolic processes and hindering germination. Conversely, at excessively high temperatures, particularly at or above 50°C, enzymes can denature, ceasing metabolic functions and preventing effective nutrient utilisation. The results highlight the importance of maintaining a suitable temperature for effective seed germination and growth. Measurement of growth in seedlings can be assessed using fresh weight and dry weight. Fresh weight refers to the total amount of organic matter and water in an organism. The advantages of measuring growth by fresh weight include the non-lethal nature of the method, ease of use, and its suitability for seedlings. However, it is less accurate, as a significant portion of the mass is water, and results can fluctuate due to water loss from transpiration and evaporation. In contrast, dry weight represents the total organic matter after removing water, achieved by heating the organism in an oven until a constant weight is reached. This method offers greater accuracy and reliability, as it yields consistent results. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks, such as the necessity of killing the organism and the risk of volatile tissues decomposing before all water is removed. Thus, both methods have their benefits and limitations, impacting their applicability in measuring growth. Changes in dry weight of a germinating seed. Figure343.growth_in_plants_and_animals_343.jpg. This is called the sigmoid curve (S shape) which is true for most organisms. Description and explanation of the graph: From point A-B, the dry weight of the seed decreases. This is because the stored food in food reserves is hydrolysed (broken down) to produce energy for germination. From point B-C, the dry weight increases steadily and then rapidly. This is because the seed has produced leaves, which are carrying out photosynthesis. It makes food, which causes its dry weight to increase. From points C-D, the growth rate decreases. This is because the plant has matured and preparing for flowering and fruiting. Most of its cells become differentiated and lose their power of cell division. This decreases the number of cells formed and hence decrease in the rate of growth. From points D-E, the dry weight remains constant. The plant has produced fruits and no more growth takes place. The numbers of cells added are equal to the number of cells which are dying off. From point E-F, weight drops because the plant is in senescence stage where the numbers of cells added are less than the numbers of cells dying off. The seeds are dispersed, the plant leaves dry and fall off. This results into a gradual decrease in dry weight until when the plant dies. Change in total weight of a germinating seed. Figure344.growth_in_plants_and_animals_344.jpg. Explanation of the graph: Most of the changes are similar to those in the graph showing changes of dry weight with time in a germinating seed except that for dry weight, the weight of water in the seed is not considered. For the total weight of the seed during germination, water is put into consideration. The initial slight increase in weight from point A-B is due to imbibition (absorption) of water into the seed. The other changes that follow in the subsequent points on the curve are similar to those in the change of dry weight with time. Note that measurement of growth in seedlings can also be assessed by measuring height, leaf area, or root development, each offering different insights into the overall health and progress of the seedling. • In groups, use scientific process skills to design, carry out and report on an experiment to investigate whether air and water are necessary for germination, and the effect of temperature on germination. • Group project: Plant a set of bean and/or maize seeds. From the time of germination, monitor and record the changes in length every week for up to 10 weeks. Record growth and development information; presenting growth data in a graph. • You can use data processing software to show changes in height of a germinating seed over time. [Assignment 6] {Identify and describe the type of seed germination in monocots and dicots}. Seed germination in monocots and dicots involves distinct processes and structures, reflecting their differences in morphology and development. Figure293.3.8.growth_in_plants_and_animals_image_004.jpg. In monocots, such as maize and grasses, germination typically follows a process known as hypogeal germination. In this type, the radicle (embryonic root) emerges first, bursting through its protective sheath called the coleorhiza. The radicle then develops fibrous roots that anchor the seedling and absorb water. Following the radicle, the protective sheath of the plumule, known as the coleoptile, opens to allow the plumule (embryonic shoot) to grow upward through the soil. The epicotyl (the portion of the stem above the cotyledons) elongates, pushing the cotyledons deeper into the ground. In monocots, the cotyledons do not contribute significantly to photosynthesis during early growth and primarily serve to absorb nutrients from the endosperm until the seedling develops true leaves. In contrast, dicots, such as tomatoes, beans, and cotton, exhibit epigeal germination. In this process, the cotyledons emerge above the soil surface due to the rapid elongation of the hypocotyl (the stem portion below the cotyledons). During epigeal germination, water is absorbed through the micropyle in a process called imbibition, softening the seed coat (testa) and causing the cotyledons to swell. As the testa splits, the radicle emerges first, followed by the hypocotyl, which elongates to push the cotyledons upwards. The cotyledons may turn green in some species and can carry out photosynthesis, contributing to the seedling's growth. They also transport the hydrolysed products of stored food reserves to the radicle and plumule for further development. Eventually, true leaves form and begin photosynthesis, marking the transition from dependence on stored nutrients to self-sufficiency in energy production. Overall, the differences in germination types between monocots and dicots reflect their evolutionary adaptations to various environmental conditions and growth strategies, influencing their early growth and establishment as plants.
