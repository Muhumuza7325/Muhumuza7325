Item 4 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: In a village in western Uganda, swamps have been cleared for cattle farmlands and sand mining. The area environment officer organized a radio talk show on sustainable use of natural resources in swamps. Unfortunately, Mary a resident of the area only heard the concluding statement, “From the presentation, I kindly request everybody to use our natural resources sustainably.”#Task:#(a) Explain to Mary the environmental problems being addressed by the environment officer and how they can be solved.#(b) Explain why the village should conserve the natural resources in the swamps.#Flooding; leads to destruction of vegetation due to water logging which prevents roots from absorbing enough oxygen or cover vegetation cutting off photosynthesis.#Silting of swamp channels / rivers as a result of destruction of swamps; This affects aquatic animals by making water turbid, hindering visibility. It may also lead to death of animals.#Destruction of natural habitats of animals e.g., frogs, snakes etc. The dangerous animals may attack human / other organisms’ settlements.#Sand mining creates deep stagnant water pools which can be risky to humans and other animals. The pools can also act as a breeding ground for vectors.#How to sustainably use the swamps.#Controlled sand mining.#Controlled harvesting of raw materials from swamps e.g., papyrus.#Planting trees in swamps to protect them from soil mass flow.#Use alternative lands / areas to graze livestock.#Desilting swamp channels.#Benefits / advantages of conserving natural resources in swamps.#Provides a good natural habitat for aquatic animals e.g., snakes, frogs etc.#The swamp is a water catchment area; hence prevent flooding in settlement areas. It also maintains a stable water table for lakes.#The swamps protect lakes and rivers from silting by filtering water before joining the main stream / water bodies.#Availability of raw materials like papyrus, reeds etc. for crafts and constructions etc.#Swamps provide water for home and industrial use.#The fish and other animals in the swamp are sources of food to man and other animals.

Item 5 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: As a result of a civil war in one of the countries neighbouring Uganda, many people entered Uganda as refugees. The local authority decided to settle the refugees on a piece of land, part of which was covered by a forest reserve next to a swamp. Several challenges arose in the community.#Task:#(a) Explain to the community how the environmental challenges came about.#(b) Advise them on how to minimize effects of the challenges and show the value of conserving the environment in the area.#Environmental challenges in the community.#Outbreak of diseases due to congestion / overcrowding / water borne diseases.#Encroachment of natural habitats for animals, which leads to attack by wild animals.#Deforestation; in an attempt of getting firewood and wood for construction.#Destruction of natural habitats for settlement and farming.#Swamp reclamation / drainage for farming and settlement.#Hunting of wild animals for food.#Loss of biodiversity.#Poor disposal of wastes.#How to minimize the effects of the challenge.#Afforestation / planting of trees which mature in a short time.#Use alternative construction materials.#Use alternative source of fuel other than firewood.#Practice wetland edge cultivation.#Sort domestic wastes into biodegradable and non-biodegradable for recycling.#Have controlled hunting of wild animals.#Values / benefits of conserving the environment.#Forests are habitats for wild animals which are sources of food.#Swamps provide raw materials like sand for construction, clay and papyrus for crafts.#Forests release oxygen which is used by animals for respiration.#Trees / forests trap / absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere hence reducing pollution and global warming.#Swamps act as water catchment areas.

Item 4 [UNEB 2024]: Mr. Ouma had a piece of land with many shrubs and indigenous trees. He cleared the land in order to grow maize on a large scale. In addition, he destroyed all ant hills with chemicals because he feared that termites would attack his maize. He also applied fertilisers in his maize garden. These caused many challenges to the environment.#Task: Explain;#(a) to Mr. Ouma the challenges he caused to the environment.#(b) why is it important for Mr. Ouma to conserve his environment.

Item 5 [UNEB 2024]: A hilly place previously covered with thick vegetation has recently been dominated by many activities that include timber-cutting, charcoal burning, rearing of cattle and crop gardening. Farmers practice bush burning in preparation for planting and also dig up and down the slopes of the hill. Incidences of strong wind, mud slides and flooding of gardens in the valleys have become common in the area.#Task: Explain;#(a) how the different activities have caused challenges in the area and how they can be overcome.#(b) why the community should conserve the environment.
