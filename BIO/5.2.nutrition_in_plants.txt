TOPIC 2 ***Nutrition in Plants*** "28 PERIODS". Competency; The learner evaluates the nutritional strategies of carbon three (C3) and carbon four (C4) plants by analysing their photosynthetic pathways and adaptation to environmental conditions so as to optimise agricultural productivity and food security under varying climatic conditions. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) evaluate the relationship between the structure of chloroplast and photosynthesis in C3 and C4 plants (u, s, gs) (Details of biochemistry are not required); b) assess the influence of environmental factors on the photosynthetic efficiency of plants to optmise photosynthetic rates and crop yields (u, s, gs, v/a). a) In groups, study images/tactile diagrams of the ultrastructure of a chloroplast, make a model, and use it to explain the functions of the parts. b) Using role play, in your groups demonstrate the lightdependent and independent stages of photosynthesis in C3 and C4 plants. c) In groups, search and discuss the specific pathways involved in the synthesis of proteins and lipids, using intermediates (ATP, NADPH, G3P) of reactions of photosynthesis. Using computer-generated infographics, present your findings to the rest of the class. a) In groups, use projectbased learning to design, build, and operate a mini-greenhouse. b) In pairs, carry out scientific investigations on the behaviour of guard cells under varying sucrose concentrations. i) write a report including relevant drawings. ii) use your findings to explain the photosynthetic theory for the opening and closure of stomata. c) In pairs, analyse data on the distribution and abundance of C3 and C4 plants at different altitudes, temperatures, and oxygen concentrations. Using a presentation program, each pair presents their report and explanations in a class plenary session;
