[Assignment 1] {Explore the importance of the process of respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic)}. Every cell in every living organism requires energy to sustain life. This energy is produced through cellular respiration, a process in which cells break down food substances, primarily carbohydrates, to release energy. Tissue respiration, often referred to as the collective process of cellular respiration within tissues, involves the coordinated breakdown of nutrients by the cells of that tissue, to meet the energy demands of the organism. Enzymes facilitate this breakdown, with glucose being the primary respiratory substrate. Other carbohydrates, such as fructose, galactose, sucrose, and lactose, as well as lipids and proteins, can also serve as alternative substrates for respiration. The energy released during respiration is stored in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), a high-energy compound formed by the combination of ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). ADP + Pi → ATP. When the body needs energy, ATP is broken down into ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), releasing energy for various bodily functions. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme ATPase. ATP → ADP + Pi + Energy. If the food a person eats contains more energy than the body needs, the excess energy is stored for later use. The body primarily stores this surplus energy as fat in adipose tissue. Carbohydrates that are not immediately used for energy are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles, but once glycogen stores are full, any additional excess carbohydrates are converted into fat. Similarly, excess dietary fats are stored in fat cells. Over time, if the body consistently consumes more energy than it expends, this can lead to an increase in body fat and, ultimately, weight gain. In the long term, an energy imbalance where intake consistently exceeds expenditure can contribute to health issues such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, some excess energy may be converted into other forms, such as muscle mass, if a person engages in regular physical activity like strength training. However, without proper energy expenditure, the body stores the surplus energy primarily as fat (for more details, refer to Topic 3.1, Nutrition types and nutrient compounds, S2 Biology). In animals, energy released from ATP breakdown supports essential functions such as maintaining blood circulation, enabling breathing movements, producing sound, and transmitting nerve impulses, which facilitate communication within the body. It also fuels cell division (mitosis or meiosis), crucial for growth and tissue repair, and powers the active transport of nutrients, ions, and waste products across cell membranes, ensuring efficient cellular function. Respiration provides the energy necessary for synthesising vital blood proteins, such as those involved in clotting and immune defence, as well as other macromolecules essential for maintaining health. Additionally, it powers the secretion of substances like hormones, enzymes, and neurotransmitters, which regulate processes such as digestion, metabolism, immune responses, and neural communication. Furthermore, respiration contributes to maintaining ion gradients essential for muscle contractions and nervous system activity. It supports thermogenesis in endothermic animals, playing a crucial role in regulating body temperature and homeostasis. Respiration also provides energy for motile structures like cilia and flagella, which are essential in processes such as clearing respiratory pathways and facilitating reproduction in certain organisms. The amount of energy required to maintain basic bodily functions at rest, such as breathing, circulation, and cellular processes, is known as the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). BMR represents the minimum energy needed for survival, and it forms the foundation for the total energy expenditure of an individual. It is influenced by factors such as age, gender, body composition (with muscle mass requiring more energy than fat), and genetics. A higher muscle mass, for example, typically results in a higher BMR, as muscles require more energy to maintain. Additionally, BMR tends to decrease with age and can be affected by hormonal changes, activity levels, and overall health. In plants, respiration plays an equally vital role, providing energy for growth, nutrient uptake, and the production of compounds required for photosynthesis. It breaks down stored carbohydrates (like starch) into glucose, which is then used for energy to support cellular functions, especially during periods when sunlight is unavailable for photosynthesis. Respiration enables essential processes such as root development, seedling growth, and responses to environmental stresses like drought, temperature fluctuations, and pathogen attacks. Additionally, respiration provides the energy required for active transport, allowing plants to absorb essential minerals and nutrients from the soil. It supports the synthesis of hormones such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, which regulate plant growth and development. Respiration also fuels the repair of damaged tissues and the production of secondary metabolites, which contribute to defence against herbivores and pathogens. Furthermore, energy from respiration aids in the opening and closing of stomata, which are critical for regulating gas exchange and water loss, ensuring the plant's overall health and survival. In plants, a similar concept to BMR is referred to as their "maintenance energy," which covers the energy needed for essential processes like nutrient uptake, cell division, and basic metabolic functions. Beyond its biological significance, respiration is also exploited commercially in various industries. In baking, fermentation (a form of anaerobic respiration) causes dough to rise as yeast produces carbon dioxide, giving baked goods their light, airy texture. In brewing, yeast performs anaerobic respiration to convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide, which are essential for producing alcoholic beverages like beer and wine. Similarly, in the dairy industry, microbial fermentation is used to create products such as cheese, yoghurt, and butter, enhancing their flavour, texture, and shelf life. Respiration is also integral to biofuel production, such as ethanol, where fermentation of sugars produces this renewable energy source. Controlled fermentation is used in food preservation, creating products like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles by relying on beneficial bacteria to ferment and preserve the food. Additionally, anaerobic respiration is exploited in biogas production, where organic waste is decomposed by microorganisms to release methane, a valuable energy source. In the pharmaceutical industry, microbial respiration is harnessed to produce antibiotics, vitamins, and enzymes. In the medical field, anaerobic respiration is utilised in the preservation of certain cells and tissues under low-oxygen conditions. Fermentation processes are also used in the synthesis of organic acids (e.g., citric and lactic acid), which are vital in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications. Additionally, it is significant in agriculture, where fermentation processes are used to produce silage, a nutritious fodder for livestock. Moreover, respiration is utilised in wastewater treatment, where microbes break down organic matter, reducing pollution and aiding in water purification. The failure of respiration results in a lack of ATP production, which has severe consequences for both plants and animals, as ATP is the primary energy currency required for almost all cellular processes. Without adequate ATP, cellular processes in animals cease, leading to the breakdown of organ systems. For instance, the heart's ability to contract and pump blood diminishes, leading to reduced circulation and oxygen delivery to other organs. Similarly, the brain, which has a high energy demand, cannot process or transmit nerve signals, resulting in loss of coordination and consciousness. Respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, become paralysed, impairing breathing and oxygen intake. The combined failure of these systems results in a cascade of events, such as hypoxia (a deficiency in oxygen reaching tissues), acidosis due to lactic acid build-up, and cell death, ultimately causing organ shutdown and death. In plants, the consequences of respiration failure are equally severe. Without respiration, cells cannot generate the energy needed for active transport processes that absorb nutrients and water from the soil. This disrupts essential functions like nutrient uptake, growth, and photosynthesis. Additionally, plants lose the ability to respond to environmental stresses such as drought, temperature changes, or pathogen attacks, as these adaptive responses require energy. Root cells, unable to perform their functions, contribute to reduced water uptake, resulting in wilting. Furthermore, tissue repair mechanisms, hormone production, and the synthesis of essential compounds are hindered, progressively impairing the plant’s health and ultimately causing death. In both animals and plants, the inability to sustain vital biochemical reactions due to a lack of energy impacts cellular homeostasis. Metabolic waste products accumulate, leading to cellular toxicity, and the failure to repair damaged cells worsens the decline in function. Without respiration, life processes come to a halt, resulting in the collapse of the organism at the cellular, tissue, and systemic levels. • In pairs, discuss the importance of respiration and the consequence of respiration failing to occur. • Class discussion on: ‘What happens if the food a person eats contains more energy than the body needs? [Assignment 2] {Explore and outline the process and site of aerobic respiration}. Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of food to release energy in the presence of O₂. This type of respiration produces energy, CO₂ and H₂O. This is the most efficient process by which energy is produced because there is complete breakdown of food and it therefore produces more energy. Aerobic respiration occurs in three main stages across different cellular locations. ([glycolysis] in the cytosol (the fluid part of the cytoplasm), [the link reaction] and [Krebs cycle] in the mitochondrial matrix, and [oxidative phosphorylation] in the inner mitochondrial membrane). It begins with glycolysis in the cytosol (the fluid part of the cytoplasm), where glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is broken down into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate, releasing a small amount of energy as ATP. The pyruvate is then transported into the mitochondria, where it undergoes the link reaction to form acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, producing ATP, NADH, and FADH₂. Finally, in the inner mitochondrial membrane, oxidative phosphorylation takes place, where NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to the electron transport chain, generating a proton gradient that powers ATP synthase to produce large amounts of ATP. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, forming water as a by-product. The entire process generates a net gain of ~30–38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Equation for aerobic respiration: Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (~30–38 ATP). C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (~915–1,159 kJ). Aerobic respiration, requiring oxygen, yields a high amount of ATP by combining glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, while anaerobic respiration (to be covered below) occurs without oxygen and relies only on glycolysis, producing less ATP and by-products like lactic acid or ethanol. In animals, the CO₂ produced diffuses from the tissues into the blood, where it is transported to the lungs and expelled through exhalation. Water is either used by cells for metabolic processes or excreted through the kidneys and sweat. In plants, the CO₂ is either used in photosynthesis to produce glucose or lost through stomata in leaves and lenticels in stems. Water is either utilised in photosynthesis to form glucose and oxygen or lost through transpiration. • In pairs, research on and write the word and symbol equations for aerobic respiration, and the site in cells where this takes place. Experiment to show that energy (heat) is released by germinating seeds during respiration. Materials: Conical flasks, germinating seeds, cotton wool, thermometer, sodium hypochlorite solution. Procedure: The seeds are soaked in H₂O for 24 hours to soften the seed coat or testa. One group of seeds is then killed by boiling them in H₂O. Boiling kills the protoplasm of cells and denature the enzymes. Both sets of seeds are soaked in formalin for 15 minutes in order to kill any bacterial and fungal spores which would cause fermentation that also liberates heat, leading to wrong interpretation of the results. Place moist germinating seeds in one flask. Place the boiled seeds in another flask. Insert a thermometer in each of the flasks plugged with cotton wool. Fix the two flasks on a retort stand in an upside-down position so that the seeds are near the thermometer bulb as shown below. Setup: Figure182.aerobic_and_anaerobic_respiration_182.jpg. Observation: After three days, the temperature in the germinating seeds is higher than that of the boiled seeds. That of the boiled seeds remains constant. Conclusion: Germinating seeds give out heat. Explanation: During germination, O₂ is absorbed to carry out respiration, which gives out energy in form of heat. Experiment to show that living organisms liberate CO₂ during aerobic respiration. Materials: Soda lime (sodium hydroxide), lime water, filter pump, toad, two delivery tubes, three flasks and corks. Procedure: A rat is used as an aerobe and the experiment is fixed as shown below and left to stand for 40 minutes. The purpose of sodium hydroxide is to absorb CO₂ from the incoming air. Lime H₂O in flask A is used to confirm the absence of CO₂ in the incoming air. Lime H₂O in flask B is used to test for the presence of CO₂ in exhaled air. The filter pump ensures one direction of air. Setup: Figure152.aerobic_and_anaerobic_respiration_152.jpg. Observation: Lime water in flask B turned milky while that in flask A remained clear. Conclusion. The living organism gives out CO₂ during respiration. Experiment to show that living organisms liberate H₂O during aerobic respiration. Note: In the original experiment demonstrating CO₂ release during respiration, replace the lime water in flask A with anhydrous calcium chloride to absorb moisture from the incoming air. In flask B, replace lime water with a suitable test for water, such as cobalt chloride paper, which changes colour in the presence of water. The rest of the setup remains the same. Flask A will absorb any moisture from the incoming air, while flask B will test for the presence of moisture in the exhaled air. Observation: The cobalt chloride paper in flask B will turn from blue to pink, indicating the presence of water. Flask A will remain dry, confirming that no moisture enters from the incoming air. Conclusion: The living organism releases water as a by-product of aerobic respiration. Experiment to demonstrate that living organisms use O₂ in aerobic respiration. Materials: Conical flask, delivery tube, beaker, sodium hydroxide solution, H₂O and germinating seeds. Procedure: Some germinating seeds are placed in a conical flask in which a test tube containing sodium hydroxide is enclosed. A delivery tube is then connected to the conical flask with one end deepened in a beaker containing H₂O. The setup is left to stand and observations are made on the level of H₂O in the delivery tube. Observation: After some time, H₂O is seen to have risen in the delivery tube. Conclusion: O₂ is used in aerobic respiration. Explanation: As the seeds respire, they use O₂ and produce CO₂. However, the CO₂ is absorbed by the sodium hydroxide solution thus it’s not added back to the air in the flask hence, there’s a decrease in the original volume of air in the flask. • In groups, use scientific process skills to design and carry out experiments to show the release of energy, production of CO₂ and H₂O, and use of O₂ during aerobic respiration. Report to class on process and findings. [Assignment 3] {Explore the relationship between plants and animals in relation to aerobic respiration and photosynthesis}. The compensation point is the light intensity at which the rate of photosynthesis equals the rate of respiration, resulting in no net gas exchange or change in plant mass. At this point, the balance between the production and consumption of starch ensures no net gain or loss in plant mass, marking the minimum light intensity needed for sustained plant growth. However, plants still require CO₂ from an external source since the balance between the production and consumption of gases at the compensation point does not provide all the necessary carbon for continued growth. The CO₂ exhaled by animals provides a readily available source of this essential gas. This interdependence is evident in the cycle of energy and gas exchange between plants and animals. In animals, aerobic respiration breaks down glucose using oxygen to produce energy, carbon dioxide, and water. The carbon dioxide produced is exhaled into the atmosphere, where plants absorb it for photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, and CO₂ to produce glucose and oxygen, which is released into the air. Animals then inhale this oxygen for aerobic respiration, completing the cycle. Thus, plants provide oxygen for animals and utilise the carbon dioxide animals release, while animals rely on plants for oxygen and the organic compounds produced through photosynthesis. Though deeply interconnected, plants and animals can live and survive entirely independent of each other under certain conditions. Some plant species, such as those in extreme environments, can survive without animals. For example, certain plants in deserts or underwater can rely solely on sunlight, water, and soil nutrients for growth, without needing any animals for pollination, seed dispersal, or other interactions. Similarly, some marine organisms, like deep-sea creatures, may rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, allowing them to thrive in environments where sunlight and plant life are absent. These organisms obtain energy through chemical reactions involving substances like hydrogen sulphide, rather than relying on plants or sunlight. Thus, while most ecosystems involve interconnected relationships between plants and animals, there are specific conditions where each can survive without direct reliance on the other. Respiration and photosynthesis are two essential biological processes that share several similarities. Both processes occur in living cells, involve the transfer and transformation of energy, rely on enzymes to facilitate reactions, and occur within specialised organelles in eukaryotic cells—mitochondria for respiration and chloroplasts for photosynthesis. They also both involve the exchange of gases; photosynthesis absorbs CO₂ and releases O₂, while respiration consumes O₂ and produces CO₂. Additionally, both processes utilise energy carriers; photosynthesis produces glucose and stores energy in its bonds, while respiration breaks down glucose to release energy in the form of ATP. Importantly, both processes are vital for sustaining life, with photosynthesis providing the organic compounds and oxygen needed by animals, and respiration providing the energy required for cellular activities in both plants and animals. Figure284.3.2.aerobic_and_anaerobic_respiration_image_001.jpg. While respiration and photosynthesis share several similarities, they have distinct roles, reactions, and conditions. Photosynthesis is an anabolic process in phototrophs, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen, using light energy captured by chlorophyll. This process requires light (energy), thus an endothermic reaction, and takes place primarily in plant cells, particularly in the chloroplasts, and is responsible for producing the organic compounds that form the base of the food chain. In contrast, respiration is a catabolic process that occurs in both plant and animal cells, where glucose (or other organic molecules) is broken down into carbon dioxide, water, and energy, typically in the form of ATP, thus an exothermic reaction. Unlike photosynthesis, respiration occurs continuously, both day and night, and does not require light. It can take place in the presence or absence of light and does not rely on chlorophyll. While photosynthesis absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, respiration absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Additionally, photosynthesis stores energy in glucose, whereas respiration releases energy, making it central to cellular activities. Thus, photosynthesis is crucial for energy entry into ecosystems, while respiration is essential for the flow of energy through living organisms, ensuring the availability of energy for growth and maintenance. • Class debate about: ‘Plants and animals can live and survive entirely independent of each other’. [Assignment 4] {Explore and outline the process of anaerobic respiration}. Anaerobic respiration is the process in which cells generate energy without oxygen. Denitrification carried out by denitrifying bacteria, sulphate reduction carried out by sulphate-reducing bacteria, and methanogenesis performed by methanogenic archaea, are forms of anaerobic respiration that use an electron transport chain with non-oxygen final electron acceptors, such as NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻, and CO₂ respectively. These processes generate ATP, but less than aerobic respiration. In contrast, fermentation, another form of anaerobic respiration, relies solely on glycolysis to regenerate NAD⁺ without using an electron transport chain, producing even less ATP compared to other forms of anaerobic respiration. In lactic acid fermentation, which occurs in animals, glucose is converted into lactic acid, releasing a small amount of energy: Glucose → Lactic acid + Energy. C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2CH₃CH(OH)COOH + 150 kJ (energy). C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₃H₆O₃ + 150kJ (energy). In alcoholic fermentation, which occurs in plants and some microorganisms like yeast, glucose is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, also producing energy: Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon dioxide + Energy. C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + 210 kJ (energy). Both of these processes generate less ATP compared to aerobic respiration, as they rely solely on glycolysis to produce energy and regenerate NAD⁺. Due to the incomplete breakdown, much of the energy remains trapped in these intermediate substances (ethanol and lactic acid), leading to less energy being released from the same amount of food. In animals, when oxygen becomes available, lactic acid can be further metabolised to release the remaining energy, demonstrating the efficiency of aerobic pathways in energy extraction. However, anaerobic respiration is crucial in situations where oxygen supply is limited or during short bursts of intense activity, such as in muscles during heavy exercise. Despite its inefficiency, anaerobic respiration allows organisms to sustain energy production temporarily when oxygen is unavailable. Equations to show anaerobic respiration. Figure153.o_level_biology_Notes_complete_image_153.jpg. • Write down the word equation for anaerobic respiration in plants and animals. Anaerobic respiration in yeast, a single-celled fungus (refer to chapter 9 of Chemistry, Carbon in Life). The form of anaerobic respiration carried out by yeast is known as fermentation. In yeast, fermentation leads to the production of ethanol (the primary product), CO₂, and energy. The enzyme zymase catalyses the entire fermentation process, which begins with the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate through glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is then converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. A key enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, plays a crucial role in the final step of fermentation, where it reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol, using electrons from NADH. This reduction process is essential for the production of ethanol during fermentation, and the regeneration of NAD⁺ ensures the continuation of glycolysis, thus providing energy for the yeast cells. Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon dioxide + Energy. C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + 210kJ (energy). [Assignment 4] {Explore the circumstances in which organisms including humans use anaerobic respiration}. Certain organisms, such as strict anaerobic bacteria and archaea, rely solely on anaerobic respiration for energy production, as they are incapable of utilising oxygen. These organisms thrive in oxygen-free environments, such as deep-sea vents, marshes, or the intestines of animals. Additionally, anaerobic respiration can occur in organisms, including humans, under conditions where oxygen supply is insufficient or unavailable, such as during short bursts of intense physical activity or in low-oxygen environments. In these cases, cells temporarily switch to anaerobic pathways, although this is not their primary mode of energy production. In mammals, anaerobic respiration can be triggered by conditions such as lung inefficiency (e.g., emphysema), decreased blood pressure from haemorrhage, low oxygen-carrying capacity due to anaemia or bone marrow diseases, reduced cardiac output from slow heart rates or coronary thrombosis, and inadequate capillary networks. Additionally, high oxygen demands during strenuous exercise or pregnancy, as well as specific states like hibernation and sperm presence in the oviduct or high altitudes can also lead to anaerobic respiration, as the sudden increase in energy needs, often necessitates a shift to anaerobic metabolism for rapid ATP production. In humans, when exercising vigorously, muscles may demand more oxygen than the cardiovascular system can supply, leading to anaerobic respiration. This allows muscles to continue contracting during intense activity, even when oxygen is limited. Despite this advantage, anaerobic respiration is inefficient for long-term energy production due to both the limited amount of ATP produced per glucose molecule and the accumulation of lactic acid, which contributes to muscle fatigue, soreness, and cramps. Severe lactic acid accumulation can lower the pH of muscle cells, impairing their function and causing discomfort, including painful muscle cramps, making this process unsustainable for prolonged physical activity. When exercise intensity decreases and oxygen becomes available, lactic acid is transported to the liver for further processing, where it undergoes two key pathways: Some of it is oxidised into CO₂, H₂O, and energy through aerobic respiration, while the rest is converted into glycogen for storage, preparing the body for future energy needs. This dual pathway allows the body to balance immediate recovery with long-term energy demands. To support these processes, the breathing rate remains elevated (deep breathing) even after exercise, providing the extra oxygen required to 'pay back' the oxygen debt (the extra energy borrowed during intense activity, which must now be repaid with oxygen). Oxygen debt refers to the amount of oxygen needed to metabolise the lactic acid accumulated during anaerobic respiration. Certain microorganisms that inhabit environments with low or no oxygen, such as waterlogged soils or the intestines of animals, rely entirely on anaerobic respiration for energy production. Flowering plants experience anaerobic respiration in young seeds and in roots growing in waterlogged soils, while aquatic plants may resort to it in stagnant ponds. In oxygen-deprived environments (particularly in stagnant solutions and the centres of decomposing fruits and organic matter), some bacteria and yeasts rely on anaerobic pathways, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as by-products, which are important in fermentation processes, such as in brewing and baking. While anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, it is vital for energy production in oxygen-limited conditions and plays a key role in various biological and industrial processes. • In pairs, research on when and why animals and plants use anaerobic respiration and its products (including by repeatedly clenching both fists with one arm down and one raised). Share conclusions through whole class discussion. [Assignment 6] {Explore some applications of anaerobic respiration in everyday life}. Video55.Revision_Respiration.mp4. Video56.Exercise.mp4. • In groups, design and give a presentation to explain applications of anaerobic respiration in everyday life. [Assignment 7] {Carry out investigations to find the products of anaerobic respiration in plants and animals}. Experiment to show that CO₂ is given off during anaerobic respiration/fermentation. Materials: Two test tubes, delivery tubes, yeast, glucose, oil and lime H₂O. Procedure: Boil about 20cm³ of glucose solution to drive off O₂ from it and allow it to cool to room temperature. Add a layer of oil over the glucose solution to prevent O₂ from dissolving in it. Add a small quantity of yeast suspension to the glucose solution using a pipette. Pour lime water in one test tube. Using a delivery tube and rubber bang, fix the delivery tube in the test tube as shown below. Leave the experiment to stand in a warm place for an hour. Setup: Figure162.aerobic_and_anaerobic_respiration_162.jpg. Set up a control experiment in the same way but using a boiled yeast suspension or without yeast or without glucose. Observation: Gas bubbles are seen in lime water and the lime water turns milky. In the control, no gas bubbles are produced, and the lime water remains clear. Conclusion: CO₂ is produced during anaerobic respiration. Explanation: Yeast breaks down glucose in absence of O₂ to produce ethanol, CO₂ and some heat. The CO₂ produced turns lime H₂O milky by reacting with calcium hydroxide to form insoluble calcium carbonate. Experiment to demonstrate the liberation of heat during fermentation of yeast / Experiment to show the production of energy in absence of O₂ (anaerobic respiration). Materials: 10% glucose solution, 10% yeast suspension, 2 vacuum/thermos flasks, 2 thermometers, cooking oil, H₂O bath, and cotton wool. Procedure: 100cc of glucose solution is boiled in a beaker over a H₂O bath so as to drive out any dissolved O₂ and then allowed to cool. 50cc of the glucose solution is each poured in each flask and small quantities of oil are added to prevent entry of O₂ into the glucose solution. Yeast solution is added below the oil layer of one of the flasks using a dropper/pipette. A thermometer is placed in each flask and kept in solution with cotton wool. The thermometer readings are recorded hourly at intervals for some time. Observation: After some time, the temperature rises in flask A steadily, while in B, the temperature remains the same. Conclusion: The temperature rises in flask A due to anaerobic respiration of glucose by producing heat. In B, there’s no yeast to respire anaerobically hence no heat is produced. Experiment to show anaerobic respiration in germinating seeds (based on the previous experiment demonstrating heat release by germinating seeds during respiration, set up a similar experiment, ensuring anaerobic conditions by using vacuum flasks instead of conical flasks to remove oxygen from the environment, thus preventing aerobic respiration and forcing the seeds to undergo anaerobic respiration). • In groups, design and carry out experiments to show: • fermentation using yeast • anaerobic respiration in germinating seeds. Share reports on outcomes. [Assignment 8] {Compare aerobic with anaerobic respiration}. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration are two processes through which living cells generate energy, but they differ significantly in their requirements and outcomes. Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen and involves the complete breakdown of glucose into carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy (ATP) in the process. This process takes place in the cytosol and mitochondria, and is highly efficient, producing up to 38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. In contrast, anaerobic respiration occurs when oxygen is unavailable, and glucose is partially broken down to produce energy. In humans, this results in the production of lactic acid, while in plants and yeast, ethanol and carbon dioxide are produced. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient, yielding only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Unlike aerobic respiration, fermentation, a form of anaerobic respiration, does not involve the mitochondria and occurs only in the cytosol. Additionally, anaerobic respiration is typically a temporary solution, whereas aerobic respiration is a sustained process that can occur over extended periods, making it the primary pathway for energy production in most organisms when oxygen is available. The by-products of aerobic respiration (CO₂ and H₂O) are harmless and can be efficiently expelled from the body, while anaerobic respiration’s by-products, like lactic acid can cause muscle fatigue and discomfort, and require further processing to prevent harmful buildup. Furthermore, the rate of ATP production is faster during anaerobic respiration, making it beneficial in short bursts of intense activity, but its inefficiency limits its usefulness for long-duration energy needs. • Individually, complete a comparison table for the two types of respiration;
