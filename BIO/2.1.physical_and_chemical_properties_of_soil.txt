Welcome to the fascinating chapter of soil in biology! In this chapter, we will uncover the hidden wonders beneath our feet, exploring how soil serves as the foundation of life on Earth. We’ll dive into the intricate composition and structure of soil, discovering how its physical, chemical, and biological properties create a vibrant ecosystem. Together, we’ll learn how soil nourishes plants, supports countless organisms, and influences everything from agriculture to environmental health. Soil, the foundation of terrestrial life, is a complex ecosystem composed of mineral fragments, air, water, organic matter, and a vibrant community of organisms. This finely divided material that blankets the Earth's surface serves multiple critical roles. Plant roots find anchorage and essential nutrients, such as water and minerals, within the soil's framework, enabling them to thrive and fuel the food chain. It also serves as a habitat for a wide range of organisms, including earthworms, termites, arthropods and countless microorganisms that break down organic matter and cycle nutrients. Furthermore, soil acts as a natural filter, processing waste products and buffering pollutants. Beyond its ecological importance, soil is a vital resource, supplying construction materials, supporting agriculture, and inspiring artistic expression. Video1.Importance_of_soil.mp4. Soil formation (refer to the chapter of rocks and minerals in chemistry). Have you ever wondered how soil is actually formed? Could new soil still be forming today, or is it all from a long time ago? In fact, soil formation is a continual and fascinating process that begins with the gradual breakdown of rocks and minerals. This breakdown of parent rocks, known as weathering, is the primary factor driving soil formation. Weathering occurs over several years and takes place in three major ways. 1) Physical/Mechanical weathering: The process of physical weathering, influenced by physical factors such as temperature fluctuations, water, wind, and ice, encompasses a variety of mechanisms that gradually disintegrate rocks and minerals, shaping the Earth's surface over time. a) Temperature. The sun's energy can heat up the rock to very high temperatures, which causes rocks like granite to expand. As temperature falls, the rocks cool down and contract. Alternate heating and cooling of the rocks on exposed mountain sides, causes expansion and contraction which cause the rock to crack and break up. b) Water. Rivers and streams wear away the rocks over which they flow by rolling pebbles and other hard particles on them, depositing mineral-rich sediment along their banks during flooding, which further enriches the soil. c) Sandstorms. When wind blows during sandstorms, it blows sand against bare rocks. d) Frosting. Frost is a weather condition where temperatures fall below 0⁰C, water in cracks freezes and expands, causing the rock to break up. 2) Chemical weathering: Chemical weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals are broken down through chemical reactions. This process is primarily driven by environmental factors such as water, air, and acids, which react with minerals in the rocks, causing them to dissolve or undergo chemical transformation. The weathering process, particularly driven by water, especially rainwater, is a common and significant geological phenomenon. As it rains, rainwater dissolves carbondioxide in the atmosphere to form a weak solution of carbonic acid. This acidic solution can dissolve certain types of rocks, especially those that are more soluble, such as limestone, gypsum, and certain types of sandstone. As these rocks dissolve, mineral elements such as calcium, magnesium, aluminium, and others are released into solution, forming an aqueous mixture enriched with these essential components. When the mineral-rich solution permeates the soil, it deposits these mineral components, enriching the soil with essential nutrients and ions necessary for plant growth. In hot damp conditions (tropics), the rocks especially those containing iron, oxidise very quickly. The oxidised rocks disintegrate to form soil. 3) Biological weathering: This is brought about by the action and presence of living organisms on rocks. Certain organisms such as lichens are able to grow on bare rock while other small flowering plants are able to grow between the rock fragments. When these die, they form humus which is a component of soil. Man contributes to biological weathering through direct splitting of rocks during road and house construction and indirectly through cultivation. There are 5 major factors influencing soil formation: Climate, living organisms, nature of soil parent material, topography of the area and time that the parent rock material is subjected to soil formation. a) Climate. The main climatic factors involved in soil formation are rainfall, temperature and wind. Rainfall and temperature influence the chemical and physical break down of the parent rock e.g., rainfall promotes weathering of rocks into small particles by leaching of soluble constituent compound in the rock. b) Living organisms. These include the vegetation cover, living microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and invertebrates e.g., earth worms. The vegetation cover influences the characteristics of the soil formed through the litter and root remains which add to the soil. The roots of some plants weaken some rocks, accelerating the weathering process. Lichens, able to grow on bare rock, facilitate physical breakdown as they grow and expand on rock surfaces. Additionally, some lichens contribute to weathering processes by secreting organic acids that dissolve minerals. Organisms like termites, feed on dead vegetation there by decomposing it. The bi-products of decomposition are added into the soil. c) Parent rock. This influences physical properties and chemical constituents of the soil e.g., granite and sand stones which are rich in mineral content give rise to sandy soils, while volcanic larva produces clay soils. d) Topography. This influences the movement of products of weathering which consist of soluble substances and solid soil particles. It affects soil depth and vegetation. Thus, on a steep or rolling topography, there is a tendency for soil erosion to occur, resulting into development of relatively shallow soils. Therefore, topography modifies the effects of climate and vegetation on soil formation. e) Time. The length of time over which soil forming processes have been in action affects the age of the soil. When the soil forming processes have taken place for a long time, one tends to get deep mature soils, provided other factors are constant. Video2.How_soil_is_formed.mp4. Soil profile. In nature, soil is composed of distinct layers, each differing in colour, composition, and particle size. This vertical arrangement of soil layers is known as the soil profile. Understanding a soil profile is essential for soil scientists, agronomists, and environmentalists because it reveals the soil's formation processes, its composition, and its potential uses. The soil profile generally reflects the various stages of soil development and is typically divided into 6 horizons [O Horizon/Organic layer, A Horizon/Topsoil, E Horizon/Eluviation Layer, B Horizon/Subsoil, C Horizon/Parent Material, and R Horizon/Bedrock]. The O Horizon/Organic Layer is the top layer, primarily composed of organic matter, such as decomposed leaves, plants, and other organic materials. It provides nutrients to plants and supports a wide range of microorganisms. The E Horizon (Eluviation Layer) is characterised by the leaching or eluviation of minerals and organic matter. It is often lighter in colour. Minerals and organic matter are transported from this layer to lower horizons. The R Horizon (Bedrock), is the bottommost layer in the soil profile. This layer is not soil but solid rock that underlies the soil and is the source of the parent material from which the soil above is formed. Over time, weathering processes can break down the bedrock, contributing to the formation of the soil horizons above it. The 3 main soil horizons are the A Horizon/topsoil, which is rich in organic matter and nutrients; the subsoil, which contains mineral deposits and less organic material; and the parent material or underlying rock, which is the source of the soil's mineral content. A soil with well-defined layers is considered mature, while soil lacking clear layers is termed immature or young. Figure92.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_092.jpg. Horizon A – Topsoil. This is the uppermost soil layer, usually about 20cm deep, and is vital for plant growth. It is well-aerated, supports a high concentration of active soil microorganisms, and is rich in humus, giving it a dark colour. This layer also contains abundant plant roots and organic litter, making it crucial for soil fertility and structure. It's the combination of these factors that makes the topsoil the most important horizon for sustaining healthy plant life. Horizon B – Sub soil. This is a thicker, light brown layer located directly beneath the topsoil. Composed mainly of rock fragments, clay, and gravel, it has several key characteristics: It is less aerated than the topsoil and generally contains only deep plant roots with few other organisms. The subsoil contains little to no humus and tends to accumulate mineral salts due to leaching from the upper layers, earning it the designation of the layer of accumulation. Horizon C – Parent rock. This is the solid rock layer found below the subsoil and represents the original, unaltered parent material. This horizon is devoid of humus, has low air content, and contains minimal mineral salts. It serves as the source of minerals for the overlying soil layers as it gradually weathers into smaller particles. In East Africa, common parent rocks include granites, volcanic rocks, and sedimentary rocks. Video3.Soil_Profile_and_Soil_Horizons.mp4. Types of soil. Soil is classified based on the size and nature of its particles, resulting in three main types: Clay soil, loam soil, and sandy soil. Each type has distinct characteristics that influence plant growth. Loam soil, a balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay, is commonly found in gardens, near compost pits, and in dumping areas due to its excellent fertility and drainage properties. Clay soil is prevalent in swamps and anthills; it has fine particles that retain water and nutrients but can become compacted and poorly aerated. Sandy soil, found on lake shores and hilly areas, has large particles that drain quickly and are less fertile, requiring careful management to support plant growth. Sandy soils: Sandy soils are characterised by their large particles, which create significant spaces between them, resulting in high porosity. This results in excellent aeration and rapid water drainage, leading to a lower water-holding capacity. Sandy soils feel coarse and gritty when wet, easily detected between the thumb and finger. They typically contain only small amounts of water and may be deficient in calcium and magnesium. Due to their quick drainage, these soils have low organic matter content, as organic material is rapidly washed away by rain. Often referred to as light soils, sandy soils are relatively easy to work with, making them manageable for various agricultural and gardening activities. Clay soils: Clay soils are characterised by their small, fine particles that create a dense, compact structure with very little space between particles, resulting in low porosity. This compactness leads to poor aeration and drainage, causing the soil to become waterlogged. When wet, clay soils feel sticky and slippery, and they become hard and difficult to cultivate when dry. They often appear grey in colour. Despite their challenging texture, clay soils have a high water-holding capacity and are potentially fertile due to their ability to retain nutrients bound to clay minerals. Clay is also used in beauty treatments; when mixed with water, oil, and honey, it forms clay masks that help to bind and draw out impurities and germs from the skin, enhancing its cleanliness and appearance. Loam soil: Loam soil is a balanced mixture of sand (about 40%), silt (about 40%), clay (about 15%), and organic matter (1-4)%. It is known for its stable crumb structure, making it ideal for crop production due to its richness in plant nutrients and organic material. The particle sizes in loam soil are moderate, and it typically has a dark brown colour. Loam soil offers moderate water-holding capacity and porosity, and it provides moderate aeration, making it well-suited for supporting healthy plant growth. Video4.Types_of_Soil.mp4. [Assignment 2] {Soil constituents and their properties}. [Assignment 3] {Experiments to find the percentage of air, water and humus in a soil sample}. [Assignment 4] {Importance of air and water in soil to other living organisms}. Components of soil. Soil constituents are the materials that make up soil, combining both living and non-living elements. Like other mixtures, soil consists of various components with differing compositions. These constituents vary depending on the soil’s location, type, and vegetation cover. The six main components of soil are: Inorganic particles (formed through weathering), humus, water, air, mineral salts, and soil-living organisms. Figure441.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_001.jpg. The combination of these constituents determines key soil properties, including texture, structure, porosity, and colour. Soil air, found in the spaces between soil particles, is crucial for plant root growth and soil organism health. It has a similar gas composition to the atmosphere, primarily consisting of oxygen and nitrogen, with carbondioxide typically present as carbonic acid in solution. The depth to which plant roots can grow depends on how effectively air can penetrate and move through the soil. Importance of soil air. Soil air provides oxygen necessary for the respiration of plant roots and soil organisms, supports seed germination, and aids in the decay of organic matter by microorganisms to produce humus. It also supplies nitrogen for fixation by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which is essential for forming nitrates and proteins. Additionally, carbondioxide in soil air contributes to soil acidity by forming carbonic acid when dissolved in water, which can benefit certain plants and enhance mineral weathering. Experiment to determine the percentage of air in the soil. Apparatus. Measuring cylinders, dry soil sample, and a water glass rod. Method: Measure about 50cm³ of dry soil in a measuring cylinder and tap the container to level out the soil. Measure 50cm³ of water in another measuring cylinder. Add the two together (observe carefully as you pour the water onto the soil). Allow the mixture to stand until no more bubbles appear. Read and record the final level of water plus soil in the measuring cylinder. Calculate the air content in terms of percentage. Example: Volume of soil = 50cm³. Volume of water = 50cm³. Final volume of water + soil after mixing = 85cm³. Volume of air in soil (100-85) = 15cm³. Percentage of air in soil sample = (vol of air in soil/vol of soil used) × 100%. Note that the volume of the mixture after stirring is lower than the volume of the mixture before stirring due to the displacement of air around soil particles by water. David, a S2 student carried out an investigation to determine the percentage of air in a given soil sample and obtained the following values: Volume of soil used = 40cm³, volume of water added to the soil = 50cm³, final volume of water + soil after mixing = 80cm³. a) Determine the volume of air in the soil sample [10cm³]. b) Calculate the percentage of air in the soil sample [25%]. Soil water originates from rainfall and is supplemented by water rising from the ground through capillary action, to replace the moisture lost through surface evaporation. It forms a thin film around soil particles, providing crucial moisture for plant roots and influencing soil properties. It keeps the soil moist and humid, which supports the survival of microorganisms. Soil water dissolves mineral salts and gases, making them readily available for plant uptake. It also dissolves carbondioxide produced by living organisms, forming carbonic acid that contributes to the chemical weathering of rocks. Additionally, soil water is vital for seed germination, photosynthesis, maintaining plant cell turgidity (supporting the plant structure, especially in herbaceous plants), and cooling the plant through transpiration as it evaporates from the leaves. Which factors affect the water content of any given soil? [Type of land cover, location of the soil, type of soil, human activities on the land, and weather conditions]. Experiment to determine the percentage of water in a soil sample. Apparatus: Evaporating dish or basin, fresh soil, weighing scale and oven or Bunsen burner. Procedure: Weigh a clean evaporating dish and record its weight. (Let the weight be X g). Fill the evaporating dish with soil and record the weight of the soil plus that of the evaporating dish. (Let the weight be Y g). Dry the soil by heating it gently over a Bunsen burner flame for about 30 minutes. Heating and weighing are repeated until a constant mass is achieved (Take care not to burn the soil (no smoke)). Re-weigh the soil and the evaporating dish. (Let it be Z g). Note: You should cool in a desiccator before weighing. This ensures that no fresh vapour enters the soil. Then calculate the water content in the soil sample as shown below. Results: Weight of the evaporating dish = X. Weight of soil + evaporating dish = Y. Weight of soil + evaporating dish after heating = Z. Weight of soil sample = Y-X. Weight of water in the soil sample = Y-Z. %age of water = (weight of water/Weight of soil) x 100%. Therefore, percentage of water = [(Y-Z)/(Y-X)] × 100%. In an investigation, 80g of a fresh soil sample was heated in a crucible. After repeated heating and cooling, the constant mass of the soil was found to be 65g. Calculate the percentage of water in the soil sample [18.8%]. Humus, the dark brown, crumbly substance that colours soil, isn't just an aesthetic touch. It's the very essence of fertile soil, formed from the gradual decomposition of fallen leaves, dead plants, animal droppings, and even small creatures. This breakdown process, often requiring ample oxygen, is fuelled by a bustling community of microbes. Depending on the climate and vegetation, different types of humus form, each playing a vital role in the intricate ecosystem beneath our feet. Humus acts like a sponge, retaining precious moisture and nutrients that plants need to thrive. It's also a vital food source for these beneficial microbes, further accelerating the decomposition cycle and promoting overall soil health. Because of humus’ dark colour, humus-rich soil absorbs more heat, aiding seed germination and accelerating decomposition, creating even more humus. Its high absorptive capacity allows it to retain water and essential minerals in the topsoil, reducing the effects of drought and leaching (mineral loss). As it decomposes, humus becomes a valuable source of plant nutrients, while also improving soil aeration and structure. Notably, humus reduces the stickiness of clay particles, stabilises soil pH, and provides food and shelter for vital soil organisms. Finally, humus acts as an insulator, protecting the soil from extreme temperature fluctuations. Experiment to determine the percentage of humus (organic matter) in the soil. Apparatus: Crucible, soil sample, weighing scale, heat source, wire, tripod stand, pipe clay (used to form a tight seal between the crucible and the lid, preventing soil particles from escaping during heating) and a triangle (a metal support used to hold the crucible on the wire gauze). Procedure: Weigh a clean empty crucible and record its weight (W g). Half fill the crucible with soil and record the exact weight of soil plus crucible (X g). Dry the soil by heating it in an oven at 105⁰C to constant weight (Y g) (the loss in weight of soil at this temperature is due to the water driven out by evaporation). Reweigh the soil and crucible and record the weight. Heat the dried soil on a crucible (the humus burns off into carbondioxide and water vapour, causing changes in colour, smell and emergence of smoke) to redness in an oven (until no further observable change). Weigh the soil after cooling and record its weight. Repeat this till a constant weight is achieved (Z g). Results: Weight of crucible = W g. Weight of crucible + fresh soil = X g. Constant weight of soil + crucible after heating at 105⁰C = Y g. Constant weight of soil + crucible after heating to redness = Z g. Original weight of the soil = (X-W) g. Weight of dry soil = (Y-W) g. Weight of dry soil after burning off humus = (Z-X) g. Weight of humus = (Y-Z) g. Percentage of humus = (Weight of humus/Original weight of the soil) x 100%. Percentage of humus = (Y-Z)/(X-W) × 100%. Exercise. 1) The following experiment was done to find out the percentage of humus in a given soil sample. The soil sample weighing 120g was heated in an oven kept at 100⁰C. The dry soil weighed 112g. The soil was then heated slowly to burn away humus. The weight of soil after all humus had burnt was 106g. Why was the soil not heated properly at first? It was not heated properly at first because it would burn the humus containing water. What was the weight of humus in the soil? Weight of soil after burning humus = 106g. Weight of dry soil = 112g. Weight of humus = (112–106) = 6g. Calculate the percentage of humus in the soil. (5%). How many times was water more than humus? (1.33). 2) The following data was obtained by a student while determining the percentage of humus in a given soil sample. Weight of crucible = 100g. Weight of crucible + fresh soil = 156g. Constant weight of the soil + crucible after heating at 105⁰C = 143g. Constant weight of the soil + crucible after heating to redness = 128g. Calculate: i) Weight of fresh soil [56g]. ii) Weight of the dry soil [43g]. iii) Weight of humus [15g]. iv) Percentage of humus in soil sample [26.8%]. Mineral salts are the lifeblood of plants, providing essential nutrients in a form they can readily absorb. These dissolved salts, derived from elements, coat soil particles in a thin film of water. Plants have varying needs for these elements, with some, like potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen, being crucial in larger quantities (macronutrients). For instance, nitrates are the essential building blocks for proteins in plants, while magnesium is vital for chlorophyll production, the green pigment that captures sunlight for photosynthesis. Deficiencies in these macronutrients can lead to poor plant growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced yields. In addition to macronutrients, plants also require micronutrients such as calcium, iron, zinc, and copper in smaller amounts, but these are irreplaceable for overall plant health. Micronutrient deficiencies can cause symptoms like stunted growth, leaf chlorosis, and poor fruit development. Beneficial elements like silicon and selenium, though not always essential, can enhance plant resilience and growth. Deficiencies in these beneficial elements may affect plant strength and disease resistance, though they are less commonly observed. Soil living organisms: Teeming with life far beyond what exists above ground, a single handful of soil can harbour more microorganisms than there are people on Earth. Soil living organisms can be broadly classified into microfauna and macrofauna. The microscopic world of microfauna is dominated by bacteria and fungi, which are the decomposers, breaking down dead plants and animals into nutrients that plants can absorb. Essential to this process are nitrogen-fixing bacteria that capture atmospheric nitrogen, converting it into a usable form (often ammonia) directly usable by some plants or further processed by other microbes. Nitrifying bacteria take over from NFB, transforming ammonia into nitrates, a form readily available for most plants. On the larger scale, macrofauna includes earthworms, revered for their role in soil health (they burrow in the soil and this improves soil aeration and drainage). They thrive in moist, humus-rich environments, while disliking dry or acidic conditions. Nematodes are a diverse group of roundworms, and while some species are beneficial to plants by feeding on pests, others can be harmful, depending on the species. Rounding out the macrofauna are soil arthropods, encompassing insects, mites, and springtails, which contribute to nutrient cycling and keep the soil aerated. It's important to note that not all soil organisms are beneficial; some can cause plant diseases, while others may even be harmful to humans. However, the vast majority contribute to a dynamic ecosystem, with waste products from some organisms becoming nutrients for others. This incredible diversity of life forms the foundation of healthy soil, ensuring its fertility and overall well-being. Experiment to investigate the presence of living organisms in soil. Apparatus: Two test tubes/conical flasks, muslin bag, topsoil, two corks, lime water/bicarbonate indicator solution. Procedure: Collect a handful of fresh topsoil and divide it into 2 equal portions. Sterilise one portion of the soil sample by heating it strongly on a crucible for 30 minutes. Leave it to cool and place it in a muslin bag. Place the remaining portion of the fresh soil sample in another muslin bag. Add equal amounts of lime water or bicarbonate indicator in the conical flasks/test tubes and then suspend the muslin bags with soil in the test tubes/conical flasks. Figure442.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_002.jpg. Allow the test tubes/conical flasks to stand for about 2 days and observe the appearance of lime water or bicarbonate solution. Observation: Lime water turns milky or the bicarbonate indicator solution turns yellow in test tube/conical flask A but remains clear in test tube/conical flask B. Conclusion: Carbondioxide was produced in test tube/conical flask A during respiration, indicating the presence of living organisms. Lime water remained clear in test tube/conical flask B because the living organisms in soil were killed by heating. Alternative experiment: Looking beyond carbondioxide production, another experiment demonstrates how soil teems with life through oxygen consumption. This setup involves two connected flasks, one containing a fresh soil sample and the other empty. A U-tube filled with water bridges the flasks, allowing for air exchange through tiny holes in stoppers sealing each flask. As the experiment progresses over several days, the water level in the U-tube rises on the side connected to the soil. This is because living organisms in the soil consume oxygen during respiration, reducing the pressure within that flask compared to the other. The pressure difference forces the water level in the U-tube to adjust, providing a visual indication of the biological activity within the soil sample. • In pairs or groups, use practical investigations and/or a set of data to calculate the percentage of air, water, and humus in different soil samples and report conclusions. • In pairs, discuss and explain the importance of air and water in soil to living organisms. [Assignment 5] {Properties of soil}. Soil properties play a very important role in determining the use of soil. They are grouped into two types, physical properties and chemical properties. Physical properties are those we can directly observe or measure, like structure, texture, porosity, and density. These properties significantly impact factors like drainage, aeration, and water holding capacity. a) Structure: Soil structure refers to the way individual soil particles are arranged and clump together. This seemingly simple arrangement has a profound impact on the soil's ability to function effectively. Imagine a well-structured soil as a well-designed city: Large channels for water flow (infiltration and drainage) and air pockets for plant respiration, much like a city's infrastructure. Conversely, a poorly structured soil resembles a congested city, hindering water movement, air circulation, and leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion. Understanding soil structure is thus essential for maintaining a healthy and productive soil environment. b) Texture: Soil texture is how rough or how smooth a particular soil sample is. The texture of the soil is determined by the relative proportions of sand, slit, clay and particle sizes present in the soil. Soil particles vary in size and their sizes are used to classify them. The different soil particles are clay (less than 0.002mm), silt (0.002mm-0.02mm), fine sand (0.02mm-2.0mm), coarse sand (0.02mm-2.0mm) and gravel (Greater than 2.0mm). Generally, sandy soils with large particles feel coarse and drain quickly, while clay soils with tiny particles feel smooth and hold more water. Figure443.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_003.jpg. Experiment to show the soil texture of topsoil (soil sedimentation test). Apparatus/materials: Measuring cylinder, Topsoil, Stirrer, Beaker. Procedure: Put water in a measuring cylinder half way. Pour soil (20cm³) in water and stir thoroughly. Leave the experiment to stand for 3 minutes and observe. Observation: The soil particles settle down slowly. The larger/heavier particles sink faster than the smaller/lighter particles. Meaning the soil will settle into distinct layers based on the size of the particles. The bottom layer will consist of gravel followed by sand then clay. Humus which consists of pieces of dead plant and animal matter floats on the water surface. Formation of bubbles is an indicator of the presence of air in soil. Figure93.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_093.jpg. Conclusion: Soil is made up of different particles, which have varying sizes and densities. • In pairs or groups, observe three different soil samples – clay, sand and loam and examine the dry soil samples, shake the samples in water and allow them to settle to show different layers/particle sizes. c) Porosity: Soil porosity refers to the amount of empty space between soil particles. Think of it as the air pockets within the soil, crucial for water drainage, air circulation, and root growth. Sandy soil possesses large spaces between the soil particles and so is more porous. Clay soil possesses very small spaces between the soil particles thus less porous. Loam soil is moderately porous. d) Bulk density: This refers to the weight of dry soil per unit volume. In simpler terms, it's how tightly packed the soil particles are. Sandy soils, with large particles and high porosity, tend to have lower bulk density. Clay soils, with small particles and lower porosity, often have higher bulk density. A denser soil can restrict root growth and drainage, while a very loose soil may not provide enough support for plants. Note: The ideal scenario lies in a balance between structure, texture, porosity, and bulk density. A well-structured soil with a mix of sand, silt, and clay particles creates a good balance of pore space and density, allowing for both water drainage and water retention, air circulation, and healthy root growth. Understanding these factors is essential for maintaining healthy and productive soil. e) Aeration: Soil aeration refers to the presence of air spaces within the soil. Just like we need air to breathe, plant roots require oxygen for healthy growth. The structure and texture of the soil, play a crucial role in aeration. Large sand particles leave generous spaces between them, resulting in well-aerated soil. This allows for good air circulation and oxygen availability for plant roots. However, the flip side is that these large spaces also allow for rapid water drainage, potentially leading to dry conditions. Clay particles are much smaller and pack tightly together, creating very little space for air. This makes clay soils poorly aerated. While clay can hold more water, limited air circulation can hinder root growth and create waterlogged conditions. The champion of aeration balance is loam. Loam soils offer moderate aeration alongside good water retention and drainage. This provides a healthy environment for most plant roots, offering both the air they need and the water they crave. f) Water drainage: Driven by gravity, water drainage is the ability of soil to allow water to move through it. This movement depends on the size of soil particles and the air spaces between them. Different soils have varying drainage rates. Sand, with large air spaces, boasts excellent drainage, ensuring good aeration but risking nutrient leaching. Clay soils, with minimal air spaces, have poor drainage, leading to waterlogging that reduces air content and hinders plant growth. Loam, the balanced champion, offers moderate drainage. Good drainage is vital for healthy plants: it removes excess water that could suffocate crops, reduces soil and nutrient loss from runoff preventing erosion (although leaching is a potential concern), and it minimises the risk of slippage on slopes. Techniques like adding organic matter/humus, mulching, and planting trees or cover crops can all improve your garden's water drainage. g) Water retention capacity: This refers to how well soil holds onto water. It depends heavily on soil texture. Sandy soils, with large air spaces, have a poor water retention capacity, draining quickly and potentially leaving plants thirsty. Humus, however, can improve water retention in sand by sticking particles together. Clay soils, on the other hand, boast a high-water retention capacity due to their tiny, tightly packed particles. However, this can lead to waterlogging if drainage is poor. Loam, the ever-reliable champion, offers moderate water retention capacity, striking a balance between holding water for plants and allowing for drainage. Experiment to compare the drainage and retention of water in sand and clay soils. Apparatus: 2 filter funnels, 2 measuring cylinders, filter papers, equal volumes of samples of dry sand and dry clay soils, water and beakers. Procedure: Measure an equal volume of each soil sample. Fold filter papers properly and put one in each funnel. Then place clay soil in the filter paper in one funnel and then sand in the other funnel. Place the funnels with their contents over measuring cylinders and at the same time pour an equal volume of water on each of the soil samples as shown in the diagrams. Figure94.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_094.jpg. Observe which soil allows water to drain through quickly. Allow the set up to stand for some time till water stops draining through the soils. Observation: Water passes through sand soil faster than clay soil. So much water is collected in the cylinder with sand soil and less water is collected in the cylinder containing clay soil. Conclusion: Clay soil holds more water than sandy soil and sandy soil drains water faster than clay. Explanation. Sandy soil has larger air spaces which enable water to drain through more rapidly and on the other hand, clay soil retains more water than sand because it has many small particles with small air spaces thereby retaining more water. Loam soil on the other hand has medium retention. h) Water capillarity through different soils: Capillarity, the process by which water rises up in a narrow cylindrical column/tube like a straw, plays a vital role in soil. It's the unseen force that allows water to move upwards from deeper layers to replace water absorbed by plant roots. This movement depends on the size of the air spaces between soil particles. Sand, with large pores, has the lowest capillarity. While water drains quickly through sand, this limited capillary action can leave some areas dry. Clay soils, with tiny spaces between tightly packed particles, have the highest water capillarity, drawing water upwards readily. However, this can also lead to waterlogging if drainage is poor. Loam, the champion of balance, offers moderate capillarity, facilitating both water movement and retention for healthy plant growth. Capillarity is the primary force enabling soil to retain water and regulate its movement. It allows for the upward and horizontal flow of water within the soil profile, as opposed to the downward movement caused by gravity. Understanding how soil texture influences capillarity is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive soil environment. Experiment to demonstrate and compare water capillarity through sand, clay and loam soil. Materials: Long glass tubes, glass troughs, muslin bags and threads, 3 retort stands and clamps, 3 samples of dry sand, clay and loam soils. Procedure: Tie a muslin sheath tightly at the end of the glass tubes. Fill one glass tube with a dry sample of sand soil and pack it well ensuring that there are no spaces in the soil. Repeat this with clay and loam soils. The glass tubes are stood vertically with the ends tied with a muslin sheath immersed in a glass trough containing enough water. The glass tubes are supported upright with retort stands and clamps as shown below. Figure95.2.1.physical_and_chemical_properties_of_soil_image_095.jpg. Observation: Water rises faster for a short distance in sand soil while in clay soil, water rises slowly but to higher distances. In loam soil, water rises moderately to a moderate distance. Conclusion: Clay soil has the highest capillarity of water. Sand soil has the lowest capillarity while loam has moderate water capillarity. Explanation. Water rises to the greatest height at the nearest stages of the experiment in sand soil because sand has large spaces that enable water to rise more rapidly in the first hours. Clay soil shows the highest rise of water hence the highest water capillarity because it is composed of tiny soil particles which present the large surface area over which water molecules cling. Water rises at a slow rate in clay soil because clay has small air spaces between its particles. *Soil colour*. While not a fundamental property itself (is a result of these other properties), soil colour serves as a powerful diagnostic tool. Darker shades often indicate rich organic matter, crucial for water retention and nutrient availability. Conversely, red tones may suggest iron oxides, influencing drainage and nutrients in complex ways. The underlying minerals and organic matter coating also play a role in colour. Importantly, darker soils tend to absorb heat more readily. By simply observing soil colour, we gain valuable insights into the hidden world beneath the surface, informing our understanding of fertility, drainage, thermal properties, and overall soil health. • Pairs/groups are to record their observations relating to the following characteristics: The colour of each soil sample. The texture of each soil sample. The size of particles in each soil sample. Design, perform and report on investigations to show: Retention, drainage and capillarity in loam, clay, and sandy soils. The report for each experiment should follow scientific methods. Chemical properties of soil. Soil chemistry plays a vital role in plant health, with two key properties: pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC). CEC, like a nutrient bank, determines how well soil holds onto essential plant cations (positively charged ions) like calcium, magnesium, and potassium ions. Soils with high CEC readily retain these vital nutrients, while low CEC soils struggle to hold onto these vital nutrients. Clay particles and organic matter, with their extensive surface area, contribute to higher CEC. Understanding CEC is crucial, as gardeners can add amendments like compost to boost a soil's ability to store nutrients for optimal plant growth. Soil pH, like the familiar concept from chemistry, is the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the soil. A neutral soil has a pH of 7, with values below 7 being acidic and above considered alkaline. Factors like parent rock (the original rock the soil formed from) and climate influence pH. Acidic soils are often found in places where the rainfall is very high and the drainage is poor due to continual leaching of base cations and accumulation of organic acids from slow decomposition. Interestingly, most tropical soils tend to be acidic due to these factors. Conversely, alkaline soils typically develop in areas with low rainfall and good drainage, where minimal leaching of base cations and rapid evaporation, concentrate salts, promoting a higher pH. Although not a definitive indicator, soil colour can sometimes offer clues: Dark green, blue, or purple suggest basic soil, while red, orange, and yellow lean towards acidic soil. Pale or light green colour indicates that the soil is neutral. Experiment to determine the soil pH. Materials: Soil, petri dish, universal indicator, and indicator chart. Procedure: Place about 3g of soil on a Petri dish and soak it with universal indicator. Leave for 2-3 minutes. Tilt the Petri dish so that the indicator drains out of the soil. Compare the indicator colour with the indicator chart. Alternatively: Soak the soil sample with distilled water. Drain off/filter off and test with universal indicator solution or universal indicator papers. Note that this is a simple experiment for educational purposes and may not provide highly accurate results compared to professional soil pH testing instruments. Importance of soil pH. Understanding soil pH is crucial for gardeners because plants have specific preferences for optimal growth. Soil pH plays a vital role in regulating several factors: i) Nutrient Availability: In acidic soils (low pH), trace minerals like iron and manganese become more soluble and available, but can reach toxic levels. Essential nutrients like phosphorus and calcium become less available. In neutral to alkaline soils (higher pH), essential nutrients are more accessible, benefiting plant growth. ii) Nutrient Absorption: Soil pH affects the electrical charge of particles, influencing how tightly they hold onto essential nutrients like calcium and magnesium. This balance impacts nutrient absorption and plant health. iii) Plant Preferences: Most plants thrive in slightly acidic or neutral soils. However, some plants have specific preferences: Acid-loving plants, like blueberries, prefer lower pH environments. Many vegetables and herbs grow best in slightly alkaline soils. By understanding these factors, gardeners can tailor their soil's pH to match the specific needs of their plants for optimal growth. If the soil is too acidic, the most common complaint, it is treated with a base (chemicals opposite to an acid) in order to neutralise it; Common treatments use slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), quick lime (calcium oxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate). • In pairs, determine the pH of a soil sample and discuss the significance of the findings. Group Project. Aim: To investigate whether crop growth is different in different soil types. Design and carry out an experiment using annual plants in soils with different percentages of contents. e.g., high clay content or high sand content. Remember to make sure to design a fair test, controlling variables. e.g., the amount of water and light the plants receive. Observe the plants and record their appearance and the yield of the crop. From your observations deduce which type of soil is best for the chosen plants, and suggest why. Record conclusions. • You can use a digital camera to capture images to be used in a word-processed experiment or report;
