Note: Minerals are limited to Ca P Fe and I; vitamins are limited to B, C, D and K.[Assignment 1] {Explain the term nutrition}. Nutrition is the science that studies the interactions between living organisms and the food they consume, encompassing the processes of intake, digestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism, and excretion. It refers to the process by which living organisms obtain, consume and use food substances to sustain life processes (metabolic processes). In green plants, essential nutrients include water, mineral salts, and carbon dioxide, while in animals, they consist of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Macronutrients, such as carbohydrates for energy, proteins for tissue repair and muscle growth, and lipids/fats and oils for energy storage and insulation, are required in large quantities and provide the energy necessary for growth, metabolism, and other vital functions. Micronutrients, including vitamins for immunity and enzyme function, and minerals for bone formation, oxygen transport, and nerve function, are needed in smaller amounts but play crucial roles in physiological functions like immune response, bone health, and cellular production. Water is fundamental for hydration, temperature regulation, nutrient transport, and supporting metabolic processes. Additionally, dietary fibre, an indigestible carbohydrate, is important for digestive health, maintaining bowel regularity, and supporting a healthy microbiome (the community of microorganisms living in a particular environment, such as the gut) across various organisms. Proper nutrition, ensuring a balance and quality of nutrients, is essential for the health and well-being of all living organisms. Modes of nutrition. Nutrition is broadly classified into two groups, namely heterotrophic nutrition (nourishment on others) and autotrophic nutrition (self-nourishment). Mixotrophic nutrition, a combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic methods, is another mode of nutrition. 1) Autotrophism/Autotrophic nutrition is a mode of nutrition where an organism synthesises its own food from inorganic nutrients using an external energy source. Since the nutrition of all other organisms depends either directly or indirectly on autotrophs, autotrophs are referred to as producers. Additionally, autotrophs contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle and oxygen production, making them essential for maintaining the balance of life on Earth. Autotrophic nutrition can be divided into two types based on the external energy source used: a) Photosynthesis: This type of nutrition involves organisms using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Examples of photosynthetic organisms include green plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria like cyanobacteria. Photosynthesis is the foundation of most ecosystems, providing the primary energy source for nearly all living organisms. b) Chemosynthesis: This type of nutrition involves organisms using energy from specific chemical reactions, such as the oxidation of inorganic compounds, to produce food. Examples of chemoautotrophs include chemosynthetic bacteria, such as those found in hydrothermal vents and sulphur-rich environments. These organisms play a crucial role in ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as deep-sea ecosystems. 2) Heterotrophism/Heterotrophic nutrition: This is the mode of nutrition whereby organisms obtain their food by consuming already manufactured organic (food) compounds. Heterotrophs, incapable of making their own food, include all animals, fungi and most bacteria. Heterotrophic nutrition can be classified into four major types: a) Symbiosis, a process where organisms (symbionts) live together in a close, often long-term, relationship that benefits at least one of the participants. The three main types of symbiosis are: (i) Mutualism, a symbiotic relationship between two organisms of different species, in which both parties benefit. In many mutualistic interactions, the benefit is nutritional for both organisms, but in some cases, only one partner gains direct nutritional advantages. For instance, lichens, which consist of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria, illustrate this relationship: The fungi provide structure and protection, while the algae or cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, supplying nutrients to both. Mycorrhizae (singular—mycorrhiza)—a mutualistic association between plant roots and fungi—enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, particularly essential elements like phosphorus from the soil, while the fungi receive carbohydrates in return. Root nodules of leguminous plants house Rhizobium bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants, which, in turn, provide carbohydrates to the bacteria. Protozoa in the stomachs of ruminants aid in digesting cellulose, benefiting from the digested food, while the ruminants gain more efficient nutrient absorption. Bees get nectar from flowers for food, while flowers get pollinated, aiding in reproduction. Egret birds often feed on parasites and ticks from grazing animals, which, although more commensal, can offer mutual benefits by reducing the parasite load on the host. Lastly, bacteria in the human gut assist in digesting complex carbohydrates and synthesising vitamins, while receiving nutrients from the host's diet. (ii) Commensalism, a symbiotic relationship between two organisms of different species, in which one organism (the commensal) benefits while the other (the host) is neither positively nor negatively affected. In many commensal interactions, the benefit is often related to access to food, habitat, or transportation. For instance, barnacles attach to the shells or skin of whales, gaining the advantage of being transported to nutrient-rich waters, while the whale remains unaffected. Similarly, remoras use sucker-like organs to attach to sharks, benefiting from the scraps of food left by the shark without impacting the shark. Epiphytic plants, like orchids, grow on the branches of trees to access sunlight and air moisture without taking nutrients from the tree, leaving the tree unaffected. Cattle egrets feed on insects stirred up by grazing animals, benefiting from the increased food availability, while the animals continue their normal activities undisturbed. Lastly, certain bacteria live on human skin, feeding on dead skin cells and oils without affecting the human host. (iii) Parasitism, a symbiotic relationship between two organisms of different species, in which one organism, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host. The parasite derives nutrients or other benefits while the host suffers from the interaction. For instance, tapeworms live in the intestines of mammals, absorbing nutrients from the host's digested food, often leading to malnutrition and other health issues for the host. Similarly, fleas, bedbugs and ticks feed on the blood of mammals, causing irritation, potential infections, and transmitting diseases to the host. The Plasmodium parasites, responsible for malaria, live in human red blood cells, causing significant health problems for the infected individual. Mistletoe plants attach to and penetrate the branches of trees or shrubs, extracting water and nutrients and potentially harming the host plant's growth. Lastly, aphids feed on the sap of plants, weakening the plant and sometimes transmitting plant diseases; b) Phagocytosis, a mode of nutrition, where unicellular organisms or simple cells (phagocytes) engulf solid food particles. For instance, macrophages, a type of white blood cell, engulf and digest pathogens like bacteria and viruses, playing a crucial role in the body's immune response. Amoebas, single-celled organisms, use phagocytosis to consume food particles by surrounding and ingesting them with their cell membrane. Neutrophils, another type of white blood cell, rapidly respond to infection by engulfing and destroying harmful microbes. In the aquatic environment, protists like ciliates use phagocytosis to capture and consume bacteria and other microorganisms for nutrition. Even in plants, specialised cells can perform phagocytosis to remove dead cells or pathogens. Through phagocytosis, cells and organisms benefit by obtaining essential nutrients or protecting themselves from harmful invaders, maintaining overall health and homeostasis; c) Saprophytic/Saprotrophic nutrition, a mode of heterotrophic nutrition, in which organisms obtain nutrients by breaking down dead or decaying organic matter. Saprophytes/saprotrophs, such as fungi and certain bacteria, secrete enzymes that decompose complex organic substances into simpler compounds, which they then absorb. For instance, Mucor, a common mould, grows on decaying organic matter such as fruits, vegetables and bread, breaking them down to absorb nutrients. Bread mould, another common mould, typically from the Rhizopus genus, also grows on bread and other starchy foods, decomposing them to obtain nutrients. Mushrooms decompose leaf litter, wood, and other organic materials in forests, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. Certain bacteria in soil decompose dead plants and animals, contributing to nutrient cycling and soil fertility. Leaf litter decomposers, such as some fungi and bacteria, play a crucial role in breaking down fallen leaves and other plant debris on the forest floor. Even in aquatic environments, saprophytic bacteria decompose dead organisms, aiding in nutrient recycling in water ecosystems. Through saprophytic nutrition, these organisms recycle nutrients, supporting plant growth and sustaining various ecosystems; d) Holozoic nutrition, a mode of nutrition, where complex organic food is ingested, digested into smaller molecules, absorbed into body tissues, assimilated (utilised) by the body, and undigested materials are egested. This mode of nutrition is typically found in free-living organisms with a specialised digestive tract. Holozoic organisms are generally animals and certain protozoa, such as some amoebas. Holozoic nutrition is characterised by the following processes: Ingestion (the taking in of complex organic food), digestion (the breakdown of food into smaller diffusible molecules), absorption (the uptake of soluble molecules from the digestive region into body tissues), assimilation (the utilisation of absorbed food molecules by the body), and egestion (the elimination of undigested food materials). Animals undergoing holozoic nutrition are classified into three groups based on diet (what they eat): Carnivores (which feed on flesh, e.g., lions and dogs), herbivores (which live entirely on plant vegetation, e.g., cows and rabbits), and omnivores (which feed on both plants and animals, e.g., humans and pigs). 3) Mixotrophic nutrition is a mode of nutrition where organisms obtain nutrients through both autotrophic and heterotrophic means. Mixotrophs can perform photosynthesis or chemosynthesis to produce their own food but can also ingest other organisms or organic matter when necessary. They include certain protists like Euglena, which can photosynthesise when light is available but also consume other organisms when light is scarce. Note: Carnivorous plants are traditionally considered predominantly phototrophic, with captured prey supplementing their diet for specific nutrients, rather than being true mixotrophs. Each mode of nutrition reflects different strategies for acquiring and utilising nutrients necessary for survival and growth.

[Assignment 2] {Identify the food nutrients, their sources, and their importance to humans}. [Assignment 3] {Explore the importance of a diet containing the different nutrients}. [Assignment 4] {Explore the causes and effects of nutrient deficiency in humans including diseases related to malnutrition}. Food is any substance that can be ingested, digested and absorbed by the body to maintain life processes (metabolic processes). Organisms require food for various essential functions, including growth, respiration, repair, protection, regulation, maintenance, reproduction, and temperature regulation. Food includes traditional nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, as well as water, which, despite not being digested or providing energy or nutrients, is quite essential. Classes of food. There are several classes of food, each serving a distinct role in maintaining health and well-being. Energy-giving foods, such as carbohydrates (e.g., bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes) and lipids/fats and oils (e.g., butter, olive oil, avocados), provide the energy necessary for bodily functions and physical activity. Body-building foods, also known as growth foods, include proteins (e.g., meat, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts) that are crucial for the development, repair, and maintenance of body tissues. Protective foods safeguard the body against infections and diseases and include vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamin C in citrus fruits, vitamin A in carrots, iron in spinach, and zinc in nuts) that support the immune system. Although not providing energy or nutrients, water is essential for supporting various bodily functions, including hydration, temperature regulation, and nutrient transport. Additionally, regulatory foods such as dietary fibre (e.g., whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) assist in maintaining digestive health and regulating body processes. Video7.How_The_Six_Basic_Nutrients_Affect_Your_Body.mp4. Nutrient compounds in food. There are seven main nutrient compounds in food, each playing a crucial role in maintaining health and supporting various bodily functions. A deficiency in any of these nutrient compounds can lead to health problems, underscoring the importance of a balanced intake of diverse nutrients for overall health. 1) Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are essential nutrients composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are grouped into four categories (monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides) based on the number of sugar molecules they are composed of. a) Monosaccharides (mono=one, saccharide= sugar): These are substances consisting of one molecule of sugar and are also known as simple sugars. They have a sweet taste, dissolve in water, form crystals, are highly reactive due to their free aldehyde or ketone groups and can pass through a selectively permeable membrane. Monosaccharides change the colour of Benedict’s solution from blue to green, yellow, orange and brown/brick red when boiled with the solution, indicating they are reducing sugars. Additionally, they have a low molecular weight compared to disaccharides and polysaccharides, and they are easily absorbed into the bloodstream during digestion. Examples include glucose (present in grapes and honey), fructose (found in many edible fruits and honey), and galactose (present in milk). Other examples are ribose, a component of RNA, and deoxyribose, a component of DNA. Monosaccharides are fundamental building blocks of more complex carbohydrates and play crucial roles in metabolic processes. b) Disaccharides (di=two): These are carbohydrate molecules made up of two simple sugars joined together. When two monosaccharides combine, it results in the loss of one molecule of water, a reaction known as a condensation reaction. Examples include: glucose + glucose = maltose + water, glucose + galactose = lactose + water, and glucose + fructose = sucrose + water. Disaccharides are generally sweeter than monosaccharides. They can be crystallised, are soluble in water, and are classified as reducing or non-reducing sugars based on their ability to change the colour of Benedict’s solution when heated. Maltose (present in germinating seeds) and lactose (present in milk) are reducing sugars (change the colour of Benedict’s solution), whereas sucrose (present in sugar cane) and trehalose (found in mushrooms, yeast, and some insects) are non-reducing sugars (does not change the colour of Benedict’s solution). Disaccharides can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by dilute mineral acids and enzymes. c) Oligosaccharides: These consist of a few (typically 3-10) sugar molecules, such as raffinose and stachyose, and often play roles in cell recognition and gut health. d) Polysaccharides (poly = many): These are complex carbohydrates composed of numerous simple sugar units linked together. They are generally insoluble in water, cannot be crystallised, are non-sweet, do not change the colour of Benedict’s solution and can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by enzymatic or acidic hydrolysis. Examples include starch, a major energy storage form in plants, consisting of amylose and amylopectin; glycogen, the primary energy storage form in animals, found in the liver and muscles, known for its highly branched structure; cellulose, which provides structural support in plant cell walls and an important source of dietary fibre; chitin, found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and in fungal cell walls; keratin, a structural protein found in hair, nails, and skin; heparin, involved in anticoagulation, found in connective tissues and secreted by mast cells; and pectin, present in fruit cell walls and used as a gelling agent in jams and jellies. Individually, draw a flow chart classifying carbohydrates. Functions of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are vital for energy supply, storage, and structural integrity in living organisms. Monosaccharides like glucose provide immediate energy for cellular processes and serve as metabolic intermediates. Disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, offer quick energy by being hydrolysed into monosaccharides and aid in energy transport. Polysaccharides play crucial roles in energy storage/act as food reserves (e.g., starch in plants, glycogen in animals), provide structural support (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls, chitin in arthropods), and regulate physiological processes (e.g., heparin in anticoagulation). Carbohydrates also have a significant commercial value as they provide raw materials for the manufacture of various products such as cellulose in paper and textiles. Their ability to provide energy when oxidised during respiration, serve as structural components, and be utilised in manufacturing, highlights the multifaceted importance of carbohydrates. Individually, state other uses of carbohydrates. Deficiency of carbohydrates: A deficiency of carbohydrates, along with other essential nutrients, can lead to a severe form of malnutrition known as marasmus. Despite a high appetite, individuals with marasmus experience severe weight loss, dehydration, stunted growth, and significant muscle wasting, giving them a generally miserable, shrunken appearance. This condition weakens the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, marasmus can lead to delayed physical and cognitive development, with some potential for long-term effects even after treatment. Marasmus is most prevalent/common among infants and young children in developing countries where food scarcity limits access to a balanced diet. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial, requiring a diet rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to restore vital nutrients and promote recovery. Additionally, preventing marasmus through promoting access to nutritious food and education about balanced diets in at-risk communities is crucial for long-term health and well-being. 2) Proteins. Proteins are essential nutrients comprising carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and sometimes sulphur or phosphorus. The fundamental building blocks of proteins are amino acids. These molecules can condense to form dipeptides, and further condensation produces polypeptides, which are proteins. As of 2024, there are 22 known amino acids, which allows for the formation of a diverse array of proteins. Amino acids can be classified into essential and non-essential types. Essential amino acids, such as leucine, lysine, and tryptophan, cannot be synthesised by the body and must be obtained through the diet, as they are vital for various bodily functions. In contrast, non-essential amino acids like alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamine can be produced by the body from other compounds, so they do not necessarily need to be acquired directly through the diet, although they remain important for overall health. Sources of proteins: Proteins can be sourced from a variety of foods, both animal and plant-based. Animal-based sources include lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yoghurt, which provide high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids. Plant-based sources include legumes (such as beans, lentils, and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and soy products like tofu and tempeh. While plant-based proteins might lack one or more essential amino acids, consuming a diverse range of these foods can provide a complete amino acid profile. For those following vegetarian or vegan diets, combining different plant-based protein sources can enable one to meet protein needs effectively. Properties of proteins. Most proteins dissolve in water to form colloidal or sticky suspensions, which means they remain dispersed rather than fully dissolving. They are also sensitive to high temperatures, which can lead to denaturation—a process where the protein’s structure is irreversibly altered, affecting its function. Proteins possess both acidic and alkaline properties, as they can act as buffers and maintain pH balance. Additionally, proteins can form complex structures through interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and disulphide links, which are crucial for their functional diversity. They can also undergo coagulation, where they solidify or aggregate when exposed to heat or acidic conditions, a principle utilised in cooking and food processing. The main functions of proteins. Proteins are essential for bodybuilding, contributing to growth and the formation of structures such as cell membranes, and are integral to the composition of tissues like horns, fingernails, and hooves. Proteins are involved in repairing and regenerating tissues that are damaged or worn out, ensuring ongoing maintenance and healing of the body. They are vital for the synthesis of body chemicals, including enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions, hormones that regulate physiological processes, antibodies that combat infections and haemoglobin that transports oxygen in the blood. In times of starvation or inadequate caloric intake, proteins can also serve as an alternative source of energy. Additionally, proteins play roles in transporting molecules across cell membranes. Protein deficiency: Protein deficiency can lead to poor health, particularly in children, and is often associated with a condition known as kwashiorkor. This condition arises from a diet severely lacking in protein, despite adequate caloric intake. Symptoms of kwashiorkor include loss of appetite and diarrhoea. Signs observed in affected individuals include changes in hair, which becomes soft, easily pluckable, and may lose its colour; growth retardation; a pot belly (swollen lower abdomen); swollen legs and joints (oedema); and wasted muscles. Kwashiorkor can be addressed with a balanced diet that includes adequate protein, and treatment typically involves gradually reintroducing protein into the diet and addressing any associated complications. 3) Lipids (fats and oils). Lipids, whose building blocks are fatty acids and glycerol, also contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but with higher proportions of hydrogen and less oxygen than carbohydrates and proteins. Due to this composition, they can yield more energy per gram compared to carbohydrates or proteins when oxidised. Fats (saturated lipids), primarily found in animal tissues (such as eggs, butter, blue band, cowboy, lard, and animal fats e.g., cow ghee and cheese), differ from oils in that fats are solids at room temperature (around 25°C), whereas oils (unsaturated lipids), mainly obtained from plant tissues (such as groundnuts, olive oil, canola oil, palm oil, castor oil, corn oil and sunflower oil), are liquids at this temperature. Properties of lipids: Unlike other nutrients, lipids leave a permanent translucent (grease) spot or mark on paper, providing a simple test for their presence. They dissolve in organic solvents, which facilitates their extraction. Lipids are waterproof, float on water, and repel it. However, they can form emulsions with water when combined with emulsifiers, due to the interaction between lipid molecules, water, and the emulsifier, offering another detection method. Functions of lipids: Lipids are a major source of energy during respiration. They insulate the body to prevent excessive heat loss, which is a key adaptation in small animals and those living in cold regions where subcutaneous fats are deposited under the skin. They also prevent water loss and entry in cells and tissues and are essential components of the waxy cuticle in plants and the cell membrane. Additionally, lipids act as shock absorbers in some animals, cushioning vital organs. In desert animals like camels, stored fat can be broken down to produce water, which is crucial for survival in arid environments. Lipids also play a role in hormone production, as many hormones are derived from lipid molecules. Furthermore, they are involved in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which are essential for various physiological functions. 4) Vitamins. Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential for various metabolic processes in the body. They play critical roles in processes such as energy production, immune function, blood clotting, and cell growth. They are required in small amounts for the normal functioning of the body and must be obtained from the diet because the body either does not produce them or produces them in insufficient quantities. They are designated with alphabetical letters and are classified into two main groups: Water-soluble (those which dissolve in water) (e.g., Vitamin C and B vitamins) and fat-soluble (dissolve in fats but not in water) (e.g., Vitamins A, D, E, and K). Note: For this level, vitamins in humans are limited to B, C, D and K. Each vitamin has specific functions and deficiencies can lead to various health problems. a) Vitamin B: Vitamin B refers to a group of water-soluble vitamins that are crucial for various metabolic processes within cells. Collectively known as the B-complex vitamins, this group comprises several distinct vitamins, each with unique roles in supporting cellular function and overall health. The B-complex vitamins include: (i) Vitamin B₁ (Thiamine): Key food sources of thiamine include whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, pork, fish, fortified cereals, yeast extracts, and certain vegetables. Thiamine is crucial for energy metabolism and nerve function, playing an essential role in converting carbohydrates into energy and supporting the nervous system. It acts as a coenzyme in sugar and amino acid catabolism, aiding in cellular energy production and neurotransmitter synthesis. Thiamine also supports cognitive function and brain health by maintaining neurotransmitters and nerve cells. Deficiency can lead to conditions such as beriberi, characterised by muscle weakness and cardiovascular issues, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a serious neurological disorder often associated with chronic alcoholism, leading to confusion, memory loss, and impaired motor function. (ii) Vitamin B₂ (Riboflavin): Riboflavin is found in foods such as milk, eggs, lean meats, green leafy vegetables, nuts, and enriched cereals and grains. It is vital for energy production, as it plays a crucial role in the conversion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into ATP, the body's main energy currency. Riboflavin also supports skin health, vision, and the production of red blood cells. It is essential for the metabolism of other B vitamins, particularly B₆ and B₃. A riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can lead to symptoms like sore throat, redness and swelling of the lining of the mouth and throat, cracks or sores on the outsides of the lips (cheilosis) and at the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), inflammation and redness of the tongue (magenta tongue), and moist, scaly skin inflammation (seborrheic dermatitis). (iii) Vitamin B₃ (Nicotinic acid/Niacin): Niacin is abundant in foods such as poultry, beef, fish, nuts, legumes, and grains, and can also be synthesised in the body from tryptophan, an amino acid. It plays a crucial role in converting food into energy by aiding enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Niacin supports digestive health, skin integrity, and nervous system function. It also supports the maintenance of healthy cholesterol levels. Niacin deficiency can cause pellagra, which is characterised by symptoms such as dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia, and can be fatal if left untreated. (iv) Vitamin B₅ (Pantothenic Acid): Pantothenic acid is found in almost all foods, with particularly high levels in whole grains, eggs, avocados, and chicken. It is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A, which is crucial in the metabolism of fatty acids and the production of energy. Pantothenic acid also plays a role in the synthesis of hormones, neurotransmitters, and red blood cells. Deficiency is rare but can cause symptoms like fatigue, irritability, numbness, muscle cramps, and gastrointestinal issues. (v) Vitamin B₆ (Pyridoxine): Pyridoxine is found in foods such as poultry, fish, potatoes, chickpeas, bananas, and fortified cereals. It is essential for amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and the production of haemoglobin. Pyridoxine also supports immune function and helps maintain normal blood sugar levels. Deficiency can lead to symptoms such as anaemia, dermatitis, depression, confusion, and weakened immune function. (vi) Vitamin B₇ (Biotin): Biotin is present in foods like eggs, nuts, seeds, salmon, and avocados, and is also produced by gut bacteria. It plays a key role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and is essential for healthy skin, hair, and nails. Biotin supports the function of enzymes involved in energy production and the synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids. Deficiency is rare but can cause symptoms such as hair loss, skin rashes, brittle nails, and neurological issues. (vii) Vitamin B₉ (Folate or Folic Acid): Folate is found in leafy green vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods. It is vital for DNA synthesis, cell division, and the proper development of the foetus during pregnancy. Folate supports the production of red and white blood cells and aids in the metabolism of amino acids. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anaemia, characterised by fatigue, weakness, irritability, and shortness of breath, and in pregnant women, it can result in neural tube defects in the developing foetus. (viii) Vitamin B₁₂ (Cobalamin): Cobalamin is found in animal products such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy. It is essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Vitamin B₁₂ also supports the maintenance of healthy nerve cells and cognitive function. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anaemia as well as neurological issues such as numbness, tingling in the hands and feet, balance problems, and cognitive disturbances. b) Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid): Vitamin C is found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, including citrus fruits (oranges, lemons), strawberries, kiwi, bell peppers, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. It is crucial for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that maintains the health and integrity of skin, blood vessels, bones, and connective tissues. Vitamin C also functions as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals, and enhances the absorption of iron from plant-based foods. Additionally, it supports the immune system by stimulating the production and function of white blood cells. Deficiency can lead to scurvy, a condition characterised by symptoms such as bleeding gums, joint pain, and poor wound healing, as well as increased susceptibility to infections. c) Vitamin D (Calciferol): Vitamin D is primarily obtained from sunlight exposure but can also be found in fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), fortified dairy products, and egg yolks. It is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines, which are crucial for maintaining healthy bones and teeth. Vitamin D also plays a role in supporting immune function and regulating cell growth. Deficiency can lead to conditions such as rickets in children, characterised by weakened bones and skeletal deformities, and osteomalacia in adults, which results in bone pain and muscle weakness. Adequate levels of vitamin D are vital for overall bone health and immune system support. d) Vitamin K: Vitamin K refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins essential for various physiological functions, primarily involved in blood clotting and bone health. The two main forms are (i) Vitamin K₁ (Phylloquinone): Vitamin K₁ is primarily found in green leafy vegetables, such as kale, cabbage, spinach, and broccoli, as well as in some vegetable oils. It is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver, which are crucial for proper blood coagulation. Vitamin K₁ also contributes to bone health by supporting the regulation of calcium. Deficiency in Vitamin K₁ can lead to increased bleeding and bruising due to impaired blood clotting, as well as potential bone issues. Adequate intake of Vitamin K₁ is vital for maintaining healthy blood clotting and supporting overall bone strength. (ii) Vitamin K₂ (Menaquinone): Vitamin K₂ is found in animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs, as well as in some fermented foods. It is crucial for bone health and cardiovascular function, as it regulates calcium deposition in bones and teeth while preventing its accumulation in the arteries. Vitamin K₂ supports the activity of osteocalcin, a protein involved in bone mineralisation, and matrix Gla-protein, which protects against arterial calcification. Deficiency in Vitamin K₂ can lead to weakened bones and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Adequate levels of Vitamin K₂ are important for maintaining bone density and cardiovascular health. 5) Mineral elements and salts. These are inorganic food constituents essential in small amounts for normal bodily functions, with deficiencies potentially leading to various deficiency diseases. These minerals are divided into two categories: Essential mineral elements (macro elements), required in relatively large amounts, including sodium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and iron; and non-essential or trace mineral elements (microelements), needed in very small amounts but still crucial for health, including zinc, molybdenum, cobalt, and manganese. Both groups are vital for processes such as enzyme function, bone health, and electrolyte balance. Note: For this level, minerals in humans are limited to Ca, P, Fe and I. a) Calcium (Ca): This is a vital mineral found in various foods and is crucial for maintaining overall health. Major sources of calcium include dairy products like milk, cheese, and yoghurt; leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach; fortified plant-based milk; nuts and seeds like almonds and chia seeds; and fish with edible bones, such as sardines and salmon. Calcium plays an essential role in the human body by supporting bone and dental health, facilitating muscle contraction, and enabling proper nerve function. It is also involved in blood clotting and hormone secretion. Calcium deficiency can lead to weakened bones and teeth, increasing the risk of fractures and conditions such as osteoporosis and rickets. Additionally, low calcium levels can result in muscle cramps, numbness, and abnormal heart rhythms, underscoring the importance of adequate calcium intake for maintaining health and preventing deficiency-related complications. b) Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus is a crucial mineral found in various foods, including meat, dairy products, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. It is essential for the formation and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth, as it works closely with calcium to build and repair bone tissue. Phosphorus also plays a key role in energy production, as it is a component of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that stores and transfers energy in cells. Additionally, phosphorus is important for nervous system function, with deficiencies potentially leading to muscle weakness, numbness, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Inadequate phosphorus levels can also result in bone pain, fatigue, and impaired bone growth and development. Ensuring adequate phosphorus intake is vital for maintaining strong bones, overall cellular function, and neurological health. c) Iron (Fe): Iron is an essential mineral found in a range of foods, including red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, fortified cereals, and leafy green vegetables, such as spinach. It is a critical component of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. Iron also supports energy production and immune function. An iron deficiency can lead to anaemia, characterised by symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, it can impair cognitive and physical performance and affect overall health. Adequate iron intake is necessary to support oxygen delivery, energy levels, and overall well-being. d) Iodine (I): Iodine is a vital trace element found in iodised salt, seafood, dairy products, and some vegetables grown in iodine-rich soil. It is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism, growth, and development. Iodine supports normal thyroid function and is crucial for cognitive development, particularly during pregnancy and early childhood. Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid-related conditions such as goitre (an enlarged thyroid gland), hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels), and developmental delays. Adequate iodine intake is essential for maintaining healthy thyroid function and overall metabolic health. 6) Roughages/dietary fibre. These are indigestible materials found in plant-based foods, primarily composed of cellulose, pectin, and lignin. Major sources of roughages include vegetables (such as cabbages and dodo), fruits, and whole grains. The functions of roughages are crucial for digestive health; they stimulate muscular movements known as peristalsis, which propel food through the alimentary canal. Some types of fibre slow down the passage of food through the intestines, while others facilitate quicker movement. Additionally, dietary fibre can contribute to lowering blood cholesterol levels, regulating blood sugar levels, and supporting a healthy gut microbiome. A lack of adequate roughage in the diet can lead to constipation, highlighting the importance of including sufficient dietary fibre to promote regular bowel movements, prevent digestive disorders, and support overall health. 7) Water. H₂O is a compound composed of two elements, oxygen and hydrogen. In living organisms, it constitutes about 60% of body weight. H₂O acts as a universal solvent, enabling the transport of absorbed foods, wastes, and hormones throughout the body via the blood, which is also primarily made up of water. It participates in numerous metabolic processes as a raw material, including respiration, photosynthesis, gaseous exchange, digestion, and waste removal. It plays a critical role in temperature regulation by cooling the body through the evaporation of sweat (perspiration) and cooling plants through the loss of water vapour (transpiration), especially on hot days. It maintains cellular hydration and function, supports electrolyte balance, and aids in nutrient digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. In plants, water creates turgor pressure, maintaining cell shape and plant rigidity. In invertebrates like earthworms and jellyfish, water-filled cavities support structure and aid movement. It also softens food during digestion (aiding in its breakdown and subsequent absorption), assists in seed dispersal, serves as a habitat for various organisms, and acts as a lubricant, with saliva lubricating the mouth, tears protecting and moistening the eyes, and synovial fluids easing joint movement. • You can use mind mapping or word processing software to categorise food groups and their sources. [Assignment 5] {Perform food tests for various nutrients (only quality testing required)}. Food tests. A food test is a scientific procedure used to detect specific nutrients or compounds in food samples, providing valuable information about their nutritional content. These tests involve chemical reagents that produce characteristic colour changes or reactions when they interact with certain substances. Although the specific colour of the test solution won’t be detailed here, it is important to always observe and record it in the results. The test solution can appear colourless or be cloudy/turbid/milky or may exhibit other variations depending on the concentration and type of substances present. a) Food tests on carbohydrates. Test for starch (The Iodine test): To 1cm³ of food sample, add 2 drops of Iodine solution. (i) Test solution turns black/blue-black: Starch present. (ii) Test solution turns yellow-brown/yellow/brown: Starch absent. Note that iodine solution is typically iodine dissolved in potassium iodide and that the colour change occurs because iodine molecules fit into the helical structure of starch, forming a blue-black complex. If starch is absent, no such complex forms and the iodine solution retains its original yellow-brown/yellow/brown colour. Test for reducing sugars. The reagent used is Benedict’s solution (a blue solution comprising of CuSO₄, sodium citrate and Na₂CO₃) [Benedict’s test for reducing sugars] or Fehling’s solution (blue) [Fehling’s test]. In Benedict's test, the colours change depending on the concentration of the sugar present. The colour change occurs because the reducing sugars donate electrons to the copper (II) ions (Cu²⁺) in Benedict's solution, reducing them to a brick-red precipitate of copper (I) oxide (Cu₂O). The different colours correspond to the varying amounts of Cu₂O precipitate, indicating the concentration of reducing sugars present. Blue indicates no reduction (no reducing sugars present), while green (low concentration of reducing sugars), yellow (moderate concentration of reducing sugars), orange (higher concentration of reducing sugars), brown or brick red (very high concentration of reducing sugars) indicate increasing amounts of reducing sugars as more Cu²⁺ are reduced to Cu₂O. To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of Benedict’s solution and boil. (i) Test solution turns blue, green, yellow, orange, brown or brick red: Reducing sugars present. (ii) Test solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Reducing sugars absent. In Fehling’s test, the presence of reducing sugars is indicated by a colour change from blue to orange/red. The test uses two separate solutions prepared fresh in the laboratory: Fehling’s Solution A, which contains blue copper (II) sulphate (CuSO₄), and Fehling’s Solution B, a clear liquid with potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle salt) and a strong alkali, usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These solutions are mixed in equal volumes to prepare the final deep blue Fehling’s solution, where the bis (tartrate) complex of Cu²⁺ is stabilised by tartrate tetra-anions. To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of Fehling’s solution and boil. (i) Test solution turns blue then orange/red: Reducing sugars present. (ii) Test solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Reducing sugars absent. Similarly, the colour change occurs because the reducing sugars donate electrons to the copper (II) ions (Cu²⁺) in Fehling's solution, reducing them to a brick-red precipitate of copper (I) oxide (Cu₂O). Test for non-reducing sugars (Benedict's test for non-reducing sugars). Benedict’s test for non-reducing sugars involves an initial hydrolysis step and a neutralisation step because non-reducing sugars cannot be directly detected by Benedict's solution. Note: Testing for non-reducing sugars is only possible if there are no reducing sugars present or only a very small amount, as reducing sugars can mask the colour change in the test, making it difficult to detect non-reducing sugars beyond the brick red colour. First, the food sample is boiled with dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) to hydrolyse non-reducing sugars into their constituent reducing sugars. After cooling, the solution is neutralised with sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO₃) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to neutralise the acid and prevent interference with Benedict's test. The final step involves adding Benedict’s solution and boiling the mixture. If the solution turns green, yellow, orange, brown or brick red, it indicates the presence of non-reducing sugars that were converted to reducing sugars during hydrolysis. If the solution remains blue, non-reducing sugars are absent. To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of dilute HCl(aq) and boil/warm, cool under tap water. Add 1cm³ dilute NaOH(aq)/ NaHCO₃(aq) followed by 2cm³ of Benedict’s solution and boil. (i) Test solution turns blue, green, yellow, orange, brown or brick red: Non-reducing sugars present. (ii) The test solution turns blue and the blue colour persists. Non-reducing sugars absent. Note: After a positive Benedict’s test, rinse the test tube with dilute HCl to neutralise any remaining alkaline residue, then add tap water to clean. Video8.Testing_for_Reducing_and_Non-reducing_sugars.mp4. b) Test for proteins. There are two food tests for proteins (Biuret test and Millon’s test). Due to the toxic nature of Millon’s reagent (a solution of mercuric nitrate in nitric acid), it is not commonly used anymore. Biuret Test: This test involves adding a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution followed by copper (II) sulphate to the sample. NaOH is a strong alkali that reacts with proteins to make the peptide bonds more accessible for subsequent reactions. It creates an alkaline environment necessary for the Biuret reagent (copper (II) sulphate) to interact effectively with the protein. The presence of proteins is indicated by a colour change to violet/purple. This reaction occurs because the copper (II) ions bind to the peptide bonds in proteins, forming a complex that exhibits the characteristic violet/purple colour. To 1cm³ of food sample, add 1cm³ of dilute NaOH(aq) followed by 4 drops of CuSO₄(aq). (i) Test solution turns blue and then violet/purple: Proteins present. (ii) Test solution turns blue and the blue colour persists: Proteins absent. c) Tests for lipids. They are tested for using the emulsion test or the Sudan III test or the grease spot (translucent spot) test. Emulsion Test: To 1cm³ of the food sample, add 1 cm³ of ethanol. Close the test tube and shake vigorously to dissolve any lipids present. Allow the mixture to settle so that the undissolved ethanol, which contains any dissolved lipids, separates from the food sample. Carefully pour the clear liquid part (ethanol containing any dissolved lipids) into another test tube containing water. (i) A milky/cloudy emulsion forms: Lipids present, indicating that the lipids have been emulsified by the water. (ii) Solution remains clear/turbid: Lipids absent. Sudan III test: To 1cm³ of the food sample, add 2-3 drops of Sudan III stain. Shake gently to mix. (i) A red-stained layer forms at the top of the solution: Lipids present, as Sudan III specifically stains lipids. (ii) Solution remains clear/turbid: Lipids absent. Translucent mark test: Rub a small amount of the food sample onto a piece of paper. (i) A permanent translucent spot or mark is left on the paper: Lipids present, indicating that the lipids have left a greasy residue. (ii) No translucent spot or mark left on the paper: Lipids absent. Video9.Testing_for_Starch_Protein_and_Lipids.mp4. Video10.Summary3_of_all_food_tests_except_non_reducing_sugars_and_vitamin_C.mp4. Video11.Summary_of_all_food_tests_except_vitamin_C.mp4. Video12.Summary2_of_all_food_tests_except_vitamin_C.mp4. d) Test for vitamin C (DCPIP test). DCPIP stands for 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol. It is a chemical used as a redox indicator in assays, particularly for detecting Vitamin C. In the presence of Vitamin C, DCPIP is reduced from its blue form to a colourless form. When testing for Vitamin C, it is important to use fresh samples because Vitamin C is highly sensitive to degradation from heat, light, and oxygen. Fresh samples ensure that the test results accurately reflect the true concentration of Vitamin C, as they have not undergone processes that could lead to loss or alteration of the vitamin. This accuracy is crucial for nutritional analysis and food quality control. To 1cm³ of DCPIP, add the food sample dropwise until in excess. (i) Deep blue colour is discharged: Vitamin C present. (ii) Deep blue colour persists: Vitamin C absent. Video13.DCPIP_test_for_vitamin_C.mp4. • In groups or pairs, carry out tests on foods such as potato, egg yolk, milk, groundnuts, and pineapple to determine what main food nutrients they contain. • You can use spreadsheets to record and analyse experimental data. [Assignment 6] {Explore the concept of balanced diet in relation to age, sex, and an individual’s activity}. Diet is the quantity and nature of the food we eat i.e., which nutrients and how much of each. A balanced diet is a meal containing all food nutrients in their right proportions, ensuring that the body receives the necessary amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, roughages and water to maintain optimal health and function. A balanced diet often varies according to age, sex, and activity level to meet the specific nutritional needs of individuals. a) Age: Nutritional needs change with age. Children require higher amounts of protein and calcium for growth, while older adults may need more fibre to maintain digestive health and vitamins to support bone strength. b) Sex: Men and women have different nutritional requirements. For instance, women of childbearing age need more iron to compensate for menstrual losses, while men might need more protein to support muscle mass. c) Activity level: Active individuals or athletes require more calories (a calorie is a unit of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1g of H₂O by 1°C) and a higher intake of proteins and carbohydrates to fuel their energy expenditure and support muscle recovery. Inactive individuals have lower calorie needs but still require a balanced intake of nutrients to maintain health. A balanced diet is often tailored to these factors to ensure that individuals receive the right amounts of essential nutrients to support their unique health needs and lifestyles. Video14.Nutrition_and_Diet.mp4. If a person relies on a poor or imbalanced diet, which contains inappropriate quantities of nutrients, they may suffer from malnutrition. Malnutrition simply refers to an unhealthy state of the body resulting from a long-term deficiency (undernutrition) or excess (overnutrition) of one or more of the essential nutrients. Both types of malnutrition can significantly impact the overall health and well-being. Undernutrition results from insufficient intake of essential nutrients, leading to conditions such as scurvy, rickets, anaemia, kwashiorkor, marasmus, beriberi, etc. Overnutrition occurs when there is an excessive intake of certain nutrients, particularly calories, leading to various health conditions. Excessive calorie consumption, particularly from high-fat and high-sugar foods, can lead to obesity, where excess energy is stored as body fat. Obesity poses several serious health risks. It increases the likelihood of developing heart disease due to the strain it puts on the cardiovascular system, leading to conditions such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Obesity also significantly raises the risk of stroke by contributing to high blood pressure and poor circulation. Additionally, obesity is linked to several types of cancer, including those of the cervix and uterus, as excess body fat can lead to hormonal imbalances and chronic inflammation that promote cancer development. Furthermore, obesity can cause or worsen type 2 diabetes, which can lead to further complications such as nerve damage, kidney disease, and vision problems. Besides the physical health risks, obesity can also result in stigma, discrimination, and psychological impacts like low self-esteem and depression, which can further affect an individual's quality of life and social interactions. Chronic overnutrition, particularly from sugary and processed foods, can also lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, with complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, and neuropathy. Additionally, excessive intake of saturated fats and cholesterol contributes to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, heart attacks, and strokes. Overnutrition can also lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may progress to more severe liver conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Managing weight through a balanced diet and regular physical activity is essential for reducing the risks associated with overnutrition and maintaining overall health. Video15.A_healthy_diet_a_healthier_world.mp4. Disordered eating patterns, such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa, are severe forms of malnutrition resulting from extreme and unhealthy dietary behaviours. Bulimia nervosa involves episodes of eating a large amount of food in a short period (binge eating) followed by compensatory behaviours like self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise (purging), fasting, diuretics or laxative use. This cycle can lead to malnutrition by causing nutrient imbalances, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances, potentially resulting in gastrointestinal issues and cardiovascular complications. Anorexia nervosa, characterised by extreme caloric restriction (self-starvation) and an intense fear of gaining weight, leads to significant malnutrition. Individuals with anorexia often experience severe weight loss, nutrient deficiencies, weakened immune function, and potential damage to vital organs. Both disorders disrupt normal nutritional intake and metabolism, leading to serious physical and psychological health consequences. Effective treatment requires addressing both the nutritional deficiencies and the underlying psychological issues to restore health and promote recovery. In recent times, many young people seem to be dissatisfied with their natural body images. This could be due to peer pressure to become slim or engage in careers that promote being slim. To attain this slim body shape, many ladies are taking diet pills, often containing stimulants. On the other hand, young men are turning to steroids, synthetic hormones used for muscle building, to appear more masculine due to careers in sports such as athletics, rugby and soccer. The use of drugs such as diet pills and anabolic steroids to alter body image poses significant health risks and can worsen conditions like obesity, anorexia, and bulimia. Diet pills can lead to cardiovascular problems, such as increased heart rate and hypertension, nutrient deficiencies, and worsen anorexia by suppressing appetite or impairing fat absorption. Long-term use of diet pills can also cause dependency and psychological issues like anxiety and depression. Anabolic steroids can cause hormonal imbalances, liver damage, cardiovascular issues like heart attacks and strokes, and worsen bulimia by altering metabolism and increasing appetite. They can also lead to psychiatric effects such as aggression, mood swings, and depression. Both substances can adversely affect weight management and overall health, increasing the risk of chronic diseases, organ damage, and mental health disorders. This underscores the need to address body image concerns through safe, sustainable methods rather than relying on potentially harmful and addictive drugs. Video16.How_To_Love_Your_Body_Sarah_Doyle.mp4. • In groups or as a whole class, discuss, research and report on: • the meaning of the term ‘balanced diet’ and what this might mean for a baby, a child, an adult woman and adult, an athlete, and an inactive person. Record your conclusions. • the likely effects of an imbalanced diet. • In groups, discuss, research and report on the dangers of: • obesity, bulimia and anorexia. • use of drugs (diet pills and steroids) to change body image. [Assignment 7] {Calculate body mass index (BMI) and explain its implication}. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple way to estimate if someone is underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. It uses just your height and weight! The calculation involves dividing your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in meters (m) squared. Squared means multiplying your height by itself (height x height). For example, someone who weighs 70kg and is 1.75 meters tall would have a BMI of: BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)². BMI = 70kg / (1.75m x 1.75m). BMI = 70kg/3.0625m². BMI ≈ 22.9. Implications: Figure444.2.3.nutrition_types_and_nutrient_compounds_image_001.jpg. Underweight (BMI < 18.5): Health risks: Increased risk of malnutrition, osteoporosis, and anaemia. Higher susceptibility to infections, delayed wound healing, weakened immune system, and potential fertility issues. Can also lead to irregular menstrual cycles in women and overall decreased physical and cognitive performance. Interventions: Adequate nutritional intake, including a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, and medical evaluation to address any underlying conditions. Nutritional supplements might be necessary. Engage in strength training exercises to build muscle mass and consider consulting a dietitian for personalised advice. Normal Weight (BMI 18.5–24.9): Health benefits: Lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Generally associated with better overall health and well-being, including improved mobility, better sleep quality, and enhanced mental health. Maintenance: Continue with a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and healthy lifestyle habits. Regular medical check-ups to monitor health status and prevent potential issues. Staying hydrated and managing stress are also important. Overweight (BMI 25–29.9): Health risks: Increased risk of developing chronic conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnoea, and certain cancers such as breast and colon cancer. It may also lead to joint problems and decreased mobility. Interventions: Adopting healthier eating habits, increasing physical activity, and monitoring weight to prevent progression to obesity. Behavioural therapy to address eating patterns, and possibly consulting a nutritionist. Stress management techniques and ensuring adequate sleep can also be beneficial. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30): Health risks and interventions (covered already). Note: For children and adolescents under 20 years, BMI is interpreted using age- and sex-specific percentiles on BMI-for-age growth charts provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Underweight is defined as a BMI less than the 5th percentile, healthy weight is between the 5th and 85th percentiles, overweight is between the 85th and 95th percentiles, and obesity is at or above the 95th percentile. Limitations of BMI: (i) Not a direct measure of body fat: BMI does not distinguish between weight from fat and muscle. A muscular person may have a high BMI but low body fat. (ii) Does not account for the distribution of fat: BMI does not indicate where fat is distributed in the body, which can be important for health risks (e.g., abdominal fat is more harmful). (iii) Population differences: The BMI categories may not be equally applicable across different ethnic groups due to variations in body composition and distribution. In summary, while BMI is a useful screening tool for categorising weight status and potential health risks, it should be considered alongside other assessments and individual health factors for a comprehensive evaluation. If you're concerned about your weight, talking to a doctor is always the best course of action. Video17.How_to_Calculate_Body_Mass_Index.mp4. • In groups, measure your weight (kg) and height (cm), and use the results to calculate your BMI. With reference to the standard BMI chart, determine your BMI status. Discuss the implications of being underweight and overweight, and what to do in both cases. Self-esteem: Self-esteem refers to an individual's overall sense of self-worth and personal value. It encompasses how we perceive and evaluate ourselves based on our abilities, qualities, and experiences. It is shaped by various factors, including personal achievements, social feedback, and cultural influences. High self-esteem reflects a positive self-image, where individuals feel confident and worthy, while low self-esteem is often characterised by self-doubt, insecurity, and a negative view of oneself. Self-esteem is closely linked to physical differences in body shape and size, as societal standards and personal perceptions of appearance can significantly impact an individual's self-worth and confidence. How do you feel about your body shape and size? Do you believe that your physical appearance affects how you view yourself and your self-worth? How do societal standards and personal perceptions of body image influence your confidence and self-esteem? Those who perceive their body shape or size as differing from societal ideals may experience diminished self-esteem and negative body image. For instance, individuals who feel they do not conform to the thin ideal often face body dissatisfaction, which can lead to issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Conversely, those who perceive their bodies as larger than societal norms may struggle with self-acceptance and face social stigma or discrimination. Positive self-esteem is fostered by promoting body diversity, self-acceptance, and focusing on health and well-being rather than appearance alone. Encouraging a supportive environment and addressing body image concerns through education and counselling can enable individuals to develop a healthier self-image and improve overall self-esteem. Video18.Our_Bodies_are_No_an_Image_Mary_Jelkovsky.mp4. • Listen to a talk or write a short speech on self-esteem in relation to physical differences in body shape and size. [Assignment 8] {Identify the major plant mineral nutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S, Mg), their role, and the symptoms of deficiencies}. Major plant mineral nutrients. Just like animals, plants need essential mineral nutrients for proper growth and development. These minerals are crucial for processes such as photosynthesis, enzyme function, and cell structure. Plants primarily absorb essential mineral nutrients from the soil in the form of soluble salts. These salts dissociate in soil solution to provide vital ions, including nitrogen (as NO₃⁻, NH₄⁺, NO₂⁻ ions), phosphorus (as H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻), potassium (as K⁺), calcium (as Ca²⁺), magnesium (as Mg²⁺), and sulphur (as SO₄²⁻). While these are the primary forms, other less common forms may also be available to plants. Understanding these nutrients and their roles is key to effective soil management and fertilisation. Water culture, where plants are grown in nutrient solutions with varying mineral compositions, is a common method used to study the specific functions of different minerals and their impact on plant growth. This is done by dissolving all other minerals in H₂O except one whose effect is being investigated. Figure116.o_level_biology_notes_complete_image_116.jpg. Experimental apparatus for culture of seedlings. A seedling culture apparatus is typically a controlled environment system designed to optimise growth conditions for young plants. Walls of the culture vessel should be opaque or painted white to keep light away from the culture in order to prevent the growth of unicellular algae that can deplete mineral nutrients. Maintaining a dry underside of the stopper is crucial to prevent stem rot. Regular air supply through a right-angled tube provides essential oxygen for root respiration. Nutrient solution renewal every two weeks is necessary to sustain optimal growth. • In groups, design and perform an experiment to compare the growth of a plant in distilled water and pond water and/or other water rich in nutrients. Use the scientific method to write a report. Adequate mineral availability in the soils ensures healthy growth and high yields, while deficiencies can lead to growth issues and reduced productivity. The major plant nutrients include: 1) Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is essential for the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. It promotes vigorous leaf and stem growth. Deficiency symptoms: Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis), stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor fruit development. Plants may exhibit overall poor growth and pale foliage. 2) Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus is vital for energy transfer within the plant, as it is a key component of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). It is a critical component of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which are essential for genetic information and protein synthesis. It also contributes to root development, flowering, and fruiting. Deficiency symptoms: Dark green or purple discolouration of older leaves, poor root development, delayed flowering, and reduced fruit and seed production. Plants may appear stunted and have limited growth. 3) Potassium (K): Potassium regulates various physiological processes, including water uptake, enzyme activation, and photosynthesis. It is also essential for the formation and maintenance of cell membranes and the synthesis of proteins. Potassium plays a critical role in the opening and closing of stomata, which are pores on the leaf surface that control gas exchange and water loss. Additionally, potassium strengthens plant tissues and enhances disease resistance, contributing to overall plant health and resilience. Deficiency symptoms: Leaf edges and tips turn brown and die (leaf scorch), reduced growth, weak stems, and increased susceptibility to diseases and pests. Plants may show poor fruit development and low yields. 4) Magnesium (Mg): Magnesium is a central component of the chlorophyll molecule and is essential for photosynthesis. It also aids in enzyme activation and energy transfer. Deficiency symptoms: Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between leaf veins) on older leaves, leaf curling (distortion and/or abnormal folding of leaves), and poor fruit development. Plants may exhibit generally poor growth and lower yields. 5) Calcium (Ca): Calcium is crucial for cell wall structure and stability, contributing to cell division, root development, and enzyme activation. Calcium compounds play a role in neutralising certain soil acids, which improves soil health and enhances nutrient availability for plants. Deficiency symptoms: Poor root growth, leaf curling (especially at the tips), and blossom end rot in fruits. New growth may show signs of distortion or necrosis. 6) Sulphur (S): Sulphur is a component of certain amino acids and vitamins. It plays a role in protein synthesis and overall plant metabolism. Deficiency symptoms: General chlorosis (yellowing) of young leaves, reduced growth, and poor fruit development. Plants may appear pale and stunted, with potential lower yields. Strategies for managing nutrient deficiencies in plants: Understanding the mobility of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, potassium being mobile, and calcium, sulphur being non-mobile) is crucial for diagnosing deficiencies. Mobile nutrients can be redistributed within the plant to new growth, so deficiencies show up first in older leaves. Conversely, immobile nutrients cannot be easily moved, leading to symptoms appearing in newer leaves first. Beyond mobility, several other factors influence nutrient availability. The interplay between water, pH, and soil chemistry plays a critical role in how well plants access essential nutrients. At acidic soil pH levels (below 7), calcium and magnesium become less soluble, making them less available for plant uptake. Conversely, in alkaline soils (pH above 7), the availability of phosphorus and potassium can be reduced. This is because these nutrients can bind to other elements in the soil, rendering them less accessible to plant roots. The presence or absence of one nutrient can also influence the availability of others. High levels of potassium in the soil, for example, can compete with magnesium for uptake by plant roots, essentially blocking magnesium from entering the plant. This phenomenon, known as nutrient antagonism, highlights the complex web of interactions that govern nutrient availability. Water acts as the delivery truck for nutrients. It dissolves these essential elements in the soil and transports them to the plant's root system for absorption. Therefore, maintaining optimal soil moisture levels is crucial for ensuring adequate nutrient uptake, alongside a suitable pH range. Regular monitoring and balanced fertilisation are also essential for preventing and correcting nutrient deficiencies in plants. Routine soil testing provides crucial information on nutrient levels and pH, allowing for targeted fertiliser application. Incorporating organic matter like compost can enhance soil fertility, while crop rotation and cover crops contribute to maintaining nutrient levels and soil health. Effective mulching conserves moisture and reduces nutrient leaching, and proper irrigation practices ensure even nutrient distribution. In cases of acute deficiencies, foliar feeding offers a quick solution, while adjusting soil pH optimises nutrient availability. By combining these strategies with consistent monitoring, farmers can effectively manage nutrient deficiencies and support robust plant growth. Video19.Nutrient_Deficiencies_In_Plants.mp4. • In groups, research on the uses of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S and Mg to plants and the effects of deficiencies. Present your findings to the class (illustrated, if possible), with examples of leaves in good health, and showing deficiencies found in the locality;
