Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the concept of classification of organisms at different levels (u); b) understand that each organism has a Latin name consisting of the genus followed by the species (u). [Assignment 1] {Explore the concept of classification of organisms at different levels}. The classification of organisms involves organising living things, both extant (those that are currently in existence) and extinct (those that are no longer in existence), into hierarchical levels, known as taxa (singular–taxon), based on shared characteristics, evolutionary relationships, and the need for a universal naming system. The branch of biology that deals with this systematic arrangement is called taxonomy, which aims to bring order and consistency to the naming and grouping of organisms. The term taxonomy is derived from the Greek words: taxis, meaning "arrangement," and nomia, meaning "distribution," reflecting its role in systematically categorising and naming organisms based on their natural relationships and characteristics. Each taxon, also known as a taxonomic unit or group, represents a rank in the hierarchy, from broad categories like kingdoms to the most specific level, species. There are seven major taxonomic ranks: Kingdom, Phylum (or division in plants), Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. Common mnemonics to remember the order from broadest to most specific include: Kampala Parents Can Over Feed Groundnuts Seriously or Kings Play Cards On Flat Glass Stools or King Philip Came Over For Good Spaghetti. The classification of organisms in biological taxonomy shares a conceptual similarity with the organisation of populations in Uganda's political administration. Just as a library categorises books into sections, shelves, and individual titles for efficient retrieval, Uganda's administrative structure divides the population into progressively smaller units. This hierarchical approach facilitates governance, resource allocation, and the provision of services by organising the population into manageable units. Population size generally decreases as one moves down the administrative hierarchy in Uganda, from the national level (country) to the district, county, sub-county, parish, village, and ultimately, the household level. This pattern mirrors the decreasing number of individuals typically observed as one moves down the taxonomic hierarchy from kingdom to species. Figure274.1.3.classification_image_001.jpg. In the population size analogy, the kingdom would correspond to the country level, representing Uganda as a whole. Within the kingdom, organisms are divided into phyla, much like Uganda is divided into districts such as Rubanda district in the southwestern region. Each phylum is further divided into classes, comparable to counties within a district, like Rubanda county in Rubanda district. Moving further down, orders align with sub-counties, like Bubare sub-county in Rubanda county. The family level represents parishes, like Bubare Parish in Bubare sub-county. At the genus level, the analogy fits villages, such as Kyamabare village within Bubare Parish. Finally, the most specific level, the species, equates to a household, such as Zikanga’s household in Kyamabare village. While the Kingdom, Phylum (or division in plants), Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species, are the primary levels, the system is flexible and can incorporate additional ranks, such as the domain (the highest taxonomic rank in biological classification, including Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota or Eukarya), subphyla, subclasses, subspecies, and various clades (groups of organisms that share a common ancestor and all of its descendants) and subclades (smaller, more specific groups within a larger clade), to further refine the classification of organisms, providing a more detailed understanding of evolutionary relationships within the tree of life. It’s also important to note that for certain organisms, recent classifications have abandoned specific traditional taxonomic ranks that are often considered not monophyletic (i.e., those ranks that do not include all descendants of a common ancestor). Instead, emphasis is placed on domains or clades for greater evolutionary accuracy while retaining some ranks that reflect more precise relationships. However, a detailed exploration of most of these sub-ranks will be discussed in higher levels of education. Video142.How_We_Are_All_Related.mp4. The kingdom, groups organisms with fundamental similarities in their cellular organisation, modes of nutrition, and general body structures. In the modern classification system, many scientists acknowledge the five kingdoms proposed by Robert Whittaker, an American ecologist and biologist, in 1969: Monera (bacteria and archaea), Protista or Protoctista (simple eukaryotic organisms), Mycota (Fungi), Plantae, and Animalia. However, some recognise the six-kingdom system proposed by Carl Woese and colleagues in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This system recognises the significant evolutionary and biochemical distinctions between two major groups of prokaryotes, leading to the division of the former kingdom Monera into two distinct kingdoms: Eubacteria (true bacteria) and Archaea. The kingdom Plantae encompasses a diverse group of multicellular organisms that typically exhibit photosynthetic capabilities, possess cell walls primarily composed of cellulose, and possess eukaryotic cells with a true nucleus. In contrast, the kingdom Animalia encompasses all multicellular, heterotrophic organisms, such as insects, mammals, and birds, which lack cell walls and rely on ingesting organic matter for nutrition. Notably, viruses are not classified within any of these kingdoms as they lack many characteristics of living organisms, such as cellular structure and independent metabolism, and only exhibit living traits when inside a host cell (for more details, refer to chapter 1.1). Within each kingdom, organisms are divided into phyla based on major structural features, such as the presence of a backbone in Chordata or the presence of an exoskeleton and jointed appendages in Arthropoda. This further narrows into classes, which categorise organisms with more specific shared traits; for instance, the class Mammalia includes warm-blooded vertebrates with hair and mammary glands, and the class Insecta includes invertebrates with a chitinous exoskeleton, three pairs of jointed legs, and a body divided into head, thorax, and abdomen. Within classes, orders group organisms with even closer similarities, such as the order Carnivora, which includes mammals that primarily consume meat and possess specific dental adaptations, and the order Rosales, which includes flowering plants such as roses, apples, and cherries, characterised by their fruit types and floral structures. Progressing further, families cluster organisms with even more detailed shared traits, reflecting closer evolutionary links; for example, the family Felidae includes cats like lions, tigers, and domestic cats, while the family Rosaceae encompasses flowering plants such as roses, strawberries, and apples. Genera (singular–genus) are even more specific, grouping species that are closely related and often capable of interbreeding, such as the genus Panthera, which includes lions and tigers, and the genus Malus, which includes various species of apples. The most specific level, the species, identifies individual organisms that can reproduce to produce fertile offspring, representing the basic unit of biological classification, such as Panthera leo for lions, Panthera tigris for tigers and Malus domestica for cultivated apples. In summary, man belongs to kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Primates, family Hominidae, genus Homo and the species Homo sapiens. However, a more comprehensive classification extends further, beginning with the domain Eukarya, encompassing all organisms with cells containing a nucleus. Within this domain, humans are classified as follows: Kingdom Animalia, Supergroup Opisthokonta, Clade Metazoa, Clade Eumetazoa, Clade Bilateria, Superphylum Deuterostomia, Phylum Chordata, Subphylum Craniata, Superclass Vertebrata, Superclass Gnathostomata, Clade Teleostomi, Clade Euteleostomi, Clade Sarcopterygii, Clade Dipnotetrapodomorpha, Superclass Tetrapoda, Clade Amniota, Class Mammalia, Infraclass Theria, Clade Eutheria, Superorder Boreoeutheria, Grandorder Euarchontoglires, Order Primates, Suborder Haplorrhini, Infraorder Simiiformes, Parvorder Catarrhini, Superfamily Hominoidea, Family Hominidae, Subfamily Homininae, Genus Homo, and finally, the species Homo sapiens. The closest living relative of humans is the common chimpanzee, which belongs to kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Primates, family Hominidae, genus Pan, and the species Pan troglodytes. On the other hand, the common bean belongs to kingdom Plantae, clade Tracheophyta (vascular plants), clade Angiosperms, clade Eudicotyledons, order Fabales, family Fabaceae, genus Phaseolus, and the species Phaseolus vulgaris. However, a more comprehensive classification extends further, beginning with the domain Eukarya, the kingdom Plantae, the supergroup Viridiplantae (green plants), clade Streptophyta, clade Streptophytina, clade Embryophyta (land plants), clade Tracheophyta, clade Euphyllophyta, clade Spermatophyta (seed plants), clade Magnoliopsida (dicotyledonous Angiosperms), clade Mesangiospermae, clade eudicotyledons, clade Gunneridae, clade Pentapetalae, clade rosids, clade fabids, order Fabales, family Fabaceae, subfamily Papilionoideae, 50 kb inversion clade, NPAAA clade, indigoferoid/millettioid clade, tribe Phaseoleae, genus Phaseolus, and finally, the species Phaseolus vulgaris. Its closest relatives are other species within the Phaseolus genus, such as Phaseolus coccineus (scarlet runner bean), Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean), and Phaseolus acutifolius (tepary bean). These hierarchical levels are essential for understanding biodiversity, tracing evolutionary relationships, and ensuring a universal system for identifying and studying organisms, thereby eliminating confusion caused by common names and regional variations. • Consider the analogy of books being classified in a library • Use an analogy of population sizes at different political administration levels in Uganda; e.g. district, county, sub- county, etc., to compare with the number of organisms in a kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. Give examples at each level and match the biological hierarchy with the ‘equivalent’ political administration level. [Assignment 2] {Explore the system of binomial nomenclature for naming organisms}. Before the establishment of the binomial nomenclature system, the naming of organisms was often inconsistent and varied widely across different cultures and languages. Ancient civilisations, such as the Greeks and Romans, used descriptive names based on observable traits, habitats, or behaviours of organisms. However, these names were usually lengthy and could differ significantly depending on the region or scholar, leading to confusion and miscommunication in the scientific community. During the Middle Ages, naturalists began to adopt more systematic approaches to naming organisms. One of the methods used during that time was polynomial nomenclature, which involved describing organisms using long, multi-word phrases that included several descriptive terms. While this approach aimed to provide more detail about the organism, it resulted in cumbersome names that were difficult to remember and use effectively in scientific discourse. The need for a more efficient and consistent naming system became apparent as more species were discovered and classified. In the 18th century, the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) introduced the binomial nomenclature system, which provided a formal method for naming and classifying living organisms. The word "binomial" comes from two Latin words: "bi," meaning two, and "nomial," meaning name. This innovative approach was a significant advancement in the biological sciences, as it standardised the way species were identified by using two Latinised terms: the genus (generic) name followed by the species (specific) name. By employing this system, Carl Linnaeus provided a clear and consistent method for naming organisms, which laid the foundation for modern taxonomy, and remains in use today. The genus name, whose first letter is always capitalised, groups organisms with shared characteristics, while the species name, written in lowercase, identifies the specific organism within the genus. When written, both names should be underlined separately or printed in italics, to distinguish them as scientific names, ensuring consistency and clarity in scientific communication. However, the system continues to evolve as new species are discovered and classified, with allowances for names derived from various languages and cultural references, or in honour of individuals. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), allow for these variations, provided they adhere to certain guidelines. For instance, names can be derived from Greek (e.g., Homo sapiens, where Homo means "man" in Greek), descriptive of characteristics (e.g., Canis lupus, which translates to "wolf" in Latin, reflecting its nature), after the discoverer (e.g., Escherichia coli, named after Theodor Escherich, who discovered that common bacterium), or honouring notable figures in science (e.g., Darwinus masillae, named in honour of Charles Darwin). Such flexibility ensures that the naming process remains relevant and inclusive, accommodating the diversity of the scientific community. Most importantly, this binomial system facilitates the study and classification of organisms by grouping those with similar characteristics, enabling scientists to identify and categorise new species more effectively. It ensures clarity and universality in scientific communication by standardising names, eliminating confusion caused by diverse local or common names, and promoting consistency across regions and disciplines for better understanding and scientific collaboration. Binomial nomenclature also reflects evolutionary relationships, aiding in classifying organisms based on shared ancestry. For instance, Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera tigris (tiger) illustrate close evolutionary relations within the Panthera genus, while Equus caballus (horse) and Equus zebra (zebra) illustrate the diversity within the Equus genus, highlighting the variation among species that still belong to the same broader group. Figure275.1.3.classification_image_002.jpg. In addition to binomial nomenclature, there is also a trinomial system used to provide further specificity in naming certain organisms, especially subspecies or varieties within a species. This system includes three Latinised terms: the genus name, the species name, and a third name that identifies the subspecies or variety. Like binomial nomenclature, trinomial names follow specific formatting conventions, with the genus and species names italicised or underlined separately, while the subspecies name is italicised or underlined in the same manner. For example, Panthera tigris tigris refers to the Bengal tiger, while Panthera tigris altaica identifies the Siberian tiger, both of which are subspecies of Panthera tigris. Similarly, Homo sapiens sapiens refers to modern humans, distinguishing them from the extinct subspecies Homo sapiens idaltu. In plants, Oryza sativa indica and Oryza sativa japonica denote two major subspecies of cultivated rice. The use of trinomials provides a structured way to account for variations within a species that result from geographical distribution, evolutionary divergence, or unique traits, enhancing the precision of classification. This additional level of specificity is crucial in fields like conservation biology, where understanding subspecies distinctions can guide efforts to preserve genetic diversity and protect endangered populations. Other examples of scientific names for familiar species include Felis catus for domestic cats, Musca domestica for a housefly, Apis mellifera for the western honey bee, Zea mays for maize, Bos taurus for a cow, Manihot esculenta for cassava, Solanum lycopersicum for tomatoes, and Persea americana for avocado (of American origin).
