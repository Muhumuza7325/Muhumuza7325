TOPIC 8 ***Growth in Plants and Development in Insects*** "36 PERIODS". Competency; The learner justifies changes in the size and complexity of plants and insects, through data analysis of research findings, in order to develop strategies to improve agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the pre- and post-germination stages during the growth and development of plants in relation to their significance in crop production (u, s, gs, v/a); b) analyse the role of insect growth stages in ecosystems, focusing on their contributions to waste management, food security, and water quality assessment (u, s). a) In groups, search for and discuss: i) the concept of seed dormancy and seed banks. ii) factors affecting and measurement of growth. iii) primary and secondary growth. Make a write-up and present to the class. b) In groups, use microscopes to investigate cell size in the different regions of a young dicotyledonous root or shoot. Make a write-up and present it to the class. In groups, search for the roles of insect growth stages in ecosystems focusing on: i) waste management. ii) food security. iii) determining water quality assessment. Make a write-up and present it to the class;
