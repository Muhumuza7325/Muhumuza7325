Item 1 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: Mr. Nsamba’s cassava garden was invaded by the neighbour’s goats at the time of tuber formation. The owner of the goats has refused to compensate Mr. Nsamba, and Mr. Nsamba is worried that the yields will be poor.#Task:#(a) Identify the plant structures affected by the goats.#Leaves, and Stems.#(b) Explain how the goats affected the processes in the cassava plants.#Photosynthesis. The cassava leaves eaten by the goats are the sites for photosynthesis which prevents the manufacturing of food; Removal of leaves removes sites for entry of carbon dioxide gas which is a raw material for photosynthesis; The breaking of stems prevents transportation of another raw material for photosynthesis, water molecules, from soil to the point of food manufacturing, hence photosynthesis will not take place.#Transpiration. The rate of transpiration will greatly reduce since there are few/no leaves available which are sites for transpiration. The broken stem will cut off the transpiration pull.#Translocation. The eaten stem barks and/or broken stems destroys the phloem tissues, hindering/preventing the movement of manufactured food from the sites of manufacture to the parts where they are needed for respiration/growth/storage.#(c) Why should Mr. Nsamba be compensated even if the cassava plants were able to grow again?#Food that should have been stored in the root tubers are instead used to facilitate growth of new plant parts. This consequently affects both the size and quality of root tubers leading to poor yields hence a need to compensate Mr. Nsamba.#The roles of the affected processes are;#Photosynthesis makes food, stored in tubers, hence increasing the quality and quantity of yields.#Transpiration allows movement of water up the plant, which is a raw material for photosynthesis.#Translocation permits movement of food from sites of manufacture to other parts e.g., for growth, storage etc.

Item 1 [UNEB 2024]: Badru is a pumpkin farmer in Kitumba village. The village experienced a long dry season characterised by high temperatures, much sunshine and dry windy conditions. During the season, the hairy pumpkin leaves would droop (bend downwards) and flower petals remained closed for a longer part of the day but they would straighten and open during early morning hours respectively. #Badru had a very poor yield of pumpkins.#Task:#(a) Mention the processes in the pumpkin plants that were affected by the conditions experienced.#(b) Describe how the conditions experienced affected the functioning of the pumpkin plants which led to poor yields.#(c) Explain how the pumpkins managed to survive the conditions experienced.
