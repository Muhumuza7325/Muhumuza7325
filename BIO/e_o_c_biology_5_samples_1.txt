Item 6 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: Two Ugandan Towns A and B each have industries that release carbon dioxide gas, smoke and dust. The levels of air pollution in the two towns are as shown in table 1. Table 1: levels of air pollution in two towns A and B. Town Level of air pollution (units) A 30 B 70 (According to American Lung Association, 2023, the normal range of air pollution is 0 – 50 units). Samuel was living in town A. He used to jog every day, and would experience normal changes in his body during and after jogging. When he shifted to town B, he continued with his usual routine of jogging. However, he started experiencing complications such as difficulty in breathing, chest pain and coughing.#Task:#(a) Explain to Samuel his experiences while living in town A and the new ones encountered in town B.#(b) Advise Samuel on how to manage the challenges experienced in town B.#Experiences in town A.#Increased body metabolism to especially generate sufficient energy required in jogging.#Increased heart beat to circulate sufficient blood around the body to facilitate faster metabolism/respiration of food to supply energy.#Increased breathing rate to ensure quick supply of oxygen to respiring tissues and remove accumulated carbon dioxide.#Accumulation of lactic acid in the body as a result of vigorous exercise, which resulted into anaerobic respiration in the body.#Sweating so as to remove excess heat generated during the exercise.#New experiences in town B.#Reduced oxygen intake presented difficulty in breathing due to too much carbon dioxide in air / pollution.#Lung irritations causing coughing due to in halation of dust from polluted environment.#Lung infections / diseases like emphysema presented with chest pain as a result of increased inhalation of polluted air.#Advise to manage challenges experienced in town B.#Go for medication to treat the respiratory complications.#Change residence from town B to a less polluted area.#Eat a balanced diet to boost the body’s immunity to have self defense.#Perform other physical activities that may not require exposure to polluted environment.#Wear a mask, especially when not engaged in jogging since he is living in a polluted area.

Item 7 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: In preparation for an inter-house competition, Chesang, a 40kg female athlete ate a meal containing 470g of carbohydrates in the morning. She believes the meal will help her perform better during the competition. However, her young brother does not seem to understand how the meal will contribute to Chesang’s success. Chesang finally won the competition but experienced muscle cramps. She rested for 20 minutes, returned home walking but the brother wondered how she still had the strength to walk home after the competition. [The recommended daily carbohydrate intake of a 40kg female athlete is (280 – 480g)]. Task: Explain to Chesang’s brother the processes that the meal she ate went through to enable her win the race, be able to come back home and how her body regained the normal state.#Processes are; digestion, absorption, assimilation and respiration.#Carbohydrates were digested in the mouth by salivary amylase, and in the duodenum by pancreatic amylase to maltose.#Maltose was digested in the ileum to glucose molecules by maltase.#The glucose produced was absorbed in the walls of ileum/villi and transported in the bloodstream to the respiring tissues/body muscles.#The glucose was broken down during respiration to provide energy/ATP, water and carbon dioxide gas were produced in the process.#The produced energy was used by Chesang’s body/muscles to run and win the race.#Changes / challenges experienced by Chesang’s body were;#Accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles.#Increased oxygen demand.#Increased energy demand.#Excess heat in the tissue/cells.#Increased amount of carbon dioxide.#How Chesang came back home and her body remained in normal state.#Excess carbohydrates stored as glycogen is converted to glucose which was respired hence providing Chesang energy to go back home.#Deep breathing enabled her take excess oxygen to breakdown the accumulated lactic acid. Also to expel carbon dioxide from the body.#Increased sweating to remove excess heat.#Increased heart beat to transport the required materials and products to target organs.

Item 6 [UNEB 2024]: Joan whose mother has hepatitis B was involved in a motor accident. He hit his head, lost a lot of blood and became unconscious. He was rushed to a nearby health centre IV where they found that he is of blood group AB and also had injured his kidneys. The doctor advised that John should undergo blood transfusion in addition to other medication.#The health care did not have blood but John's relatives with safe blood were willing to donate to save his life.
