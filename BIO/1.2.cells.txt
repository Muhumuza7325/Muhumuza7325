Competency; The learner appreciates the cell as the basic unit of living organisms including how the structures of different specialized cells are related to their functions. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know that the basic unit of living organisms is a cell (k); b) know and understand the structure and functions of a typical animal cell and plant cell (k, u, s); c) understand the structure of specialized cells in terms of their functions in an organism (u); d) understand levels of organization in organisms (cell, tissue, organ, system, organism) (u). [Assignment 1] {What is a cell?}. A cell is the smallest basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all living organisms, often referred to as the building block of life. Unicellular organisms, such as amoeba and paramecium, are made up of a single cell, while multicellular organisms, such as humans, cows, and bean plants, consist of many cells. All cells are enclosed by a membrane that regulates the exchange of substances with their environment, contain cytoplasm—a gel-like substance where cellular processes occur—and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which serves as the genetic material. Within eukaryotic cells, specialised structures called organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, carry out specific functions, while prokaryotic cells lack these membrane-bound organelles and have a simpler organisation. The process of cell division is crucial for the growth and repair of tissues, as new cells are formed from pre-existing cells. The original cell is referred to as the parent or mother cell, while the newly produced cells are known as daughter cells. The origin of the cell is a significant event in the history of life on Earth. It is widely believed that cells first arose around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, with prokaryotic cells emerging as the earliest life forms. Many scientists believe these primitive cells evolved from self-replicating molecules in a primordial "soup" under conditions favourable for life, although other hypotheses also propose possible origins for early cellular life. The endosymbiotic theory explains the evolution of complex eukaryotic cells, suggesting that some organelles, like mitochondria and chloroplasts, were once free-living prokaryotes that formed symbiotic relationships with ancestral eukaryotes. The discovery of cells dates back to 1655 when Robert Hooke first observed them using a microscope. He coined the term "cell," derived from the Latin word "cella," meaning "small room," after seeing the small, box-like structures in cork, which he likened to the cells inhabited by monks. Hooke's observations laid the foundation for the field of cell biology, leading to further advancements in our understanding of cellular structure and function, including the development of the cell theory, which states that all living organisms are composed of cells, cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Today, cells exhibit remarkable diversity, enabling the vast array of life forms seen on Earth, from single-celled bacteria to complex multicellular organisms. For instance, the average human body contains approximately 37.2 trillion cells, highlighting the intricate organisation and complexity of multicellular life.

Animal and plant cells are both eukaryotic, meaning they possess a true nucleus, often positioned centrally in many cells, along with other membrane-bound organelles. Both cell types share fundamental structures such as a plasma membrane, also known as the cell membrane, which is semipermeable and regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell, maintains the cell's shape and strength, offers protection to the inner parts of the cell, and binds the cytoplasm. Both have a nucleus (plural—nuclei) for controlling cell activities and housing genetic material, which is visible in the form of chromatin during interphase and condenses into chromosomes during cell division. It also plays an active role in protein synthesis, facilitated by the nucleolus—a dense structure within it that synthesises ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and assembles ribosomal subunits, crucial components of the protein synthesis machinery. The nucleus contains nucleoplasm, a gel-like substance that provides a medium for its components. Both cell types have the cytoplasm, consisting of various organelles and cytosol, the fluid component that provides a medium for the organelles to function. The cytoplasm serves as the site for metabolic reactions and facilitates the transport of materials within the cell. Surrounding the nucleus is a double membrane, called the nuclear envelope, which separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm and allows for the exchange of materials through nuclear pores. While the term "protoplasm" is still used in some contexts (referring to the living contents of a cell, including both cytoplasm and nuclear material), it's less common in modern biology. Both cell types also contain mitochondria (singular—mitochondrion), the "powerhouses" of the cell, serving as the site for energy production through cellular respiration, generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel various cellular processes, and ribosomes, responsible for protein synthesis, essential for producing enzymes, structural proteins, and signalling molecules. Additionally, both cell types have an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus that work in tandem for protein and lipid synthesis, modification, and transport; the rough ER, studded with ribosomes, synthesises proteins destined for secretion or membrane incorporation, while the smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification processes and the secretion of enzymes. The Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex or Golgi body, processes and packages these molecules for distribution throughout the cell or for export outside the cell. Vacuoles are also present in both cell types, though their size and function vary. Plant cells typically have a large central vacuole that maintains turgor pressure for cell rigidity, stores water, nutrients, and waste products, and contributes to the cell's shape, surrounded by a single membrane called the tonoplast, which regulates the movement of substances in and out of the vacuole. In contrast, animal cells have smaller, temporary vacuoles involved in storage, waste disposal, and transport of materials within the cell. Note that plant vacuoles contain "cell sap," a distinct fluid rich in sugars, salts, and enzymes, while animal vacuole contents are generally referred to as cytosol or vacuolar fluid. However, the two cell types exhibit distinct structural and functional differences suited to their physiological roles. Plant cells have unique features, including a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, which provides structural support, protects against mechanical stress, helps maintain a generally regular shape—often rectangular in many types—and plays a role in regulating water movement. They also contain chloroplasts, the sites of photosynthesis, which house chlorophyll, a green pigment that traps sunlight. Within chloroplasts, light energy is captured and transformed into chemical energy, specifically in the form of glucose. This vital process not only provides plants with a crucial energy source but also releases oxygen as a byproduct, contributing significantly to the Earth's atmosphere. In contrast, animal cells typically lack these structures but possess centrosomes, each containing two centrioles that play a vital role in cell division by organising the microtubules that separate chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis, ensuring accurate distribution of genetic material. Animal cells may also contain lysosomes that secrete hydrolytic enzymes for breaking down waste and old cell components, playing a key role in cellular digestion and recycling. The flexibility of animal cells, due to the absence of a rigid cell wall, allows for shape changes (often described as round or irregular) and specialised roles in tissues, enabling the cells to form various tissue types and perform diverse functions. Other structures of a cell include peroxisomes, present in both cell types, which are organelles containing enzymes for lipid metabolism and the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, a toxic byproduct of cellular processes. The cytoskeleton, present in both cell types, is a network of protein filaments and tubules that provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and facilitates movement within the cell. Cilia (singular—cilium) and flagella (singular—flagellum), typically found in animal cells but absent in most plant cells, are hair-like structures involved in cell movement and the movement of fluids across the cell surface. Plasmodesmata (singular—plasmodesma), that occur exclusively in plant cells, are channels allowing for communication and transport of materials between adjacent cells. Secretory vesicles, present in both cell types, are membrane-bound vesicles that transport materials, such as proteins, to the cell membrane for secretion outside the cell. Additionally, microvilli (singular—microvillus), primarily associated with animal cells, are small, finger-like projections that increase the surface area of certain epithelial cells, facilitating the absorption of nutrients and other substances. This combination of shared and unique organelles equips plant and animal cells to perform their specialised roles effectively. And, while plant cells generally exhibit larger dimensions than animal cells, this is not a universal rule. Animal cells, such as egg cells, can attain considerable size, surpassing many plant cells. Conversely, certain plant cells, like those in mosses, may be relatively small. Figure283.1.2.cells_image_001.jpg. Figure284.1.2.cells_image_002.jpg. Video122.Cell_structure.mp4. Video123.Cell_organelles_and_structures.mp4. • Observe prepared slides of plant and animal cells, draw cells and identify similarities and differences. • Draw and label the animal and plant cell as seen under a light microscope. • You can use a suitable graphical program to draw animal and plant cells. • Research on the functions of the parts in a plant and animal cell, and annotate labels on cell diagrams accordingly. [Assignment 3] {Explore the structure of specialized cells in terms of their functions in an organism}. The differentiation of cells is a fundamental process in the growth and development of multicellular organisms. It is the mechanism by which unspecialised or less specialised cells, typically stem cells, become specialised to perform specific functions within the organism. This process is critical for the proper organisation, functioning, and adaptation of multicellular organisms. A more in-depth examination of cellular differentiation will be presented in Topic 9.2, Development in plants and animals. In animals, various specialised cell types exemplify how structure relates to function. Muscle cells that include skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle cells, for instance, are elongated and contain numerous contractile proteins, enabling them to contract and facilitate movement. The structural arrangement of these proteins allows for efficient force generation and movement. Nerve cells (neurons) possess long axons and dendrites, facilitating the rapid transmission of electrical signals across distances in the body. Their specialised structure enables the complex communication necessary for coordinating bodily functions. Epithelial cells, which form protective barriers, are tightly packed to prevent the entry of pathogens while allowing selective transport of substances, highlighting the importance of their structural integrity in maintaining homeostasis. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) are biconcave and lack a nucleus, maximising their surface area for oxygen transport and enabling flexibility to navigate through narrow blood vessels. They contain haemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen, allowing these cells to efficiently carry it from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. White blood cells (leukocytes), including various types such as lymphocytes and phagocytes, have distinctive shapes and structures that enable them to identify and combat pathogens effectively. Platelets (thrombocytes) are small, disc-shaped cell fragments that play a crucial role in blood clotting. Their irregular shape and the presence of various proteins allow them to adhere to damaged blood vessels and aggregate to form clots, preventing excessive bleeding. Sperm cells are highly specialised for reproduction, featuring a streamlined shape and a flagellum for propulsion, as well as a midpiece packed with mitochondria to provide the energy needed for movement towards the ovum. In contrast, the ovum (egg cell) is larger and has a rich supply of cytoplasm and nutrients to support early embryonic development upon fertilisation. Fat cells (adipocytes) are specialised for energy storage and insulation. They have a large lipid droplet that stores triglycerides, while the cytoplasm and nucleus are pushed to the periphery. Adipocytes also regulate metabolism by releasing hormones like leptin. Bone cells include osteoblasts, which build bone by secreting collagen and minerals; osteoclasts, large multinucleated cells that resorb bone using acids and enzymes; and osteocytes, star-shaped cells embedded in the bone matrix. Osteocytes maintain bone health by sensing stress and coordinating remodelling through nutrient and waste exchange. Figure285.1.2.cells_image_003.jpg. In plants, specialised cells also illustrate the relationship between structure and function. Xylem cells, such as tracheids and vessel elements, are hollow and reinforced with lignin, enabling them to effectively transport water and minerals from the roots to the leaves while also providing structural support to the plant. Phloem cells, including sieve tube elements and companion cells, have thin walls and specialised sieve plates that facilitate the transport of sugars and nutrients throughout the plant. Figure286.1.2.cells_image_004.jpg. Guard cells surrounding stomata (singular—stoma) are shaped in a way that allows them to regulate gas exchange and water loss, demonstrating how their structure is essential for maintaining the plant’s physiological balance. Figure287.1.2.cells_image_005.jpg. Root hair cells have long extensions that increase surface area for water and nutrient absorption from the soil. Figure288.1.2.cells_image_006.jpg. Palisade mesophyll cells in the leaves of green plants contain numerous chloroplasts, optimising photosynthesis by efficiently capturing sunlight, while spongy mesophyll cells, located beneath the palisade layer, are loosely arranged with air spaces to enhance gas exchange. Figure289.1.2.cells_image_007.jpg. Notably, multinucleate cells, such as skeletal muscle cells, osteoclasts —cells that break down bone, and sieve tube elements in the phloem, possess multiple nuclei that enhance their specific functions. This adaptation allows them to perform specialised tasks more efficiently, supporting their unique roles within their respective organisms. Please note that there are still many specialised cells that have not been covered; therefore, you are encouraged to explore and expand the list further. Understanding the structure of specialised cells offers insights into how multicellular organisms efficiently perform complex processes such as photosynthesis, digestion, respiration, and nutrient transport. In summary, specialised cells in both animals and plants exhibit unique structures that align with their functions, contributing to the organism's efficiency, adaptability, and survival.

[Assignment 4] {Explore the levels of organization in organisms (cell, tissue, organ, system, organism)}. The levels of organisation in organisms represent a hierarchical structure that begins with the atom, the basic unit of matter, forming simple molecules like water and oxygen gas, essential for life. Simple molecules combine to form macromolecules, such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), that combine to form organelles (eukaryotes only), such as the nucleus and mitochondria in animals or chloroplasts in plants, which carry out specialised functions within the cell–the basic unit of life. Tissues are formed from specialised groups of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function. These tissues can consist of a single cell type or multiple cell types. In animals, they include epithelial tissue for protection, muscle tissue for movement, nervous tissue for transmitting signals, and connective tissue (e.g., bone, cartilage, adipose tissue, and blood) for structural support, binding of tissues, protection of organs, and transportation of substances within the body. In plants, tissues include the meristematic tissue, responsible for growth, epidermal tissue, which provides protection, vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) for water and nutrient transport, and ground tissue for storage and photosynthesis. Tissues form organs (structures made up of different types of tissues that work together to perform a specific function), which in animals include the liver (blood filtration and detoxification of the body), heart (pumping blood throughout the body), lungs (gas exchange), stomach (digestion of food), brain (control and coordination), kidneys (waste filtration), intestines (absorb nutrients–small intestine and process waste–large intestine), skin (body protection and temperature regulation), pancreas (production of digestive enzymes and hormones), spleen (blood filtration and support to the immune system), eye for sight, ear for hearing, balance, and posture. In plants, organs include leaves (photosynthesis and transpiration), stems (support and transport), roots (absorption and anchorage), and flowers (reproduction). These organs operate within organ systems (groups of organs that work together to perform a vital function for the organism. In animals, systems include the digestive system (stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas), which breaks down food; the respiratory system (lungs, trachea, and diaphragm), which facilitates gas exchange; the circulatory system (heart, blood, and blood vessels), which transports nutrients and oxygen; the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and nerves), which controls responses; the excretory system (kidneys, bladder, and urethra), which eliminates waste; the endocrine system (endocrine glands such as thyroid, adrenal, and pancreas), which regulates hormones; the reproductive system (ovaries, testes, uterus, and associated structures), for producing offspring; the immune system (white blood cells, spleen and the lymphatic system, including lymph nodes, vessels, and lymph) for defending against pathogens; the skeletal system (bones, cartilage, and ligaments) for providing structure and protection; the muscular system (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles) for movement; the integumentary system (skin and its appendages such as hair and nails) for protection, temperature regulation, and sensation. In plants, organ systems primarily include the root system, which absorbs water and nutrients, and the shoot system (leaves, stems, flowers), which supports photosynthesis and reproduction. Each system works collaboratively to maintain homeostasis and support the overall health and functionality of the organism. Walking in mammals exemplifies the coordinated function of multiple body systems. The skeletal system provides the structural framework, acting as levers for muscle contraction. The muscular system, driven by signals from the nervous system, generates the force for movement. The respiratory system supplies the essential oxygen for muscle function. The circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles, which are essential for cellular respiration. This metabolic process generates ATP, the primary energy currency for muscle contraction. Concurrently, the circulatory system effectively delivers metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid, to the excretory system for elimination. The endocrine system regulates energy production and metabolism, supporting overall activity. The integumentary system provides protection, sensory feedback crucial for balance and coordination, and regulates body temperature through sweating. Finally, the immune system plays a role in immune function, helping to protect the body from infections that could impair walking ability. Video124.Human_body_systems.mp4. The different organ systems form a complete organism (an individual living thing), capable of independent life, such as a tree or a human. Note: Simpler organisms may be unicellular, lacking tissues, organs, and organ systems. Beyond the organism, groups of the same species form populations (groups of organisms of the same species that live in the same area). These populations interact with one another and with populations of different species, forming communities (groups of different populations that live in the same area and interact with each other), which represent the biotic (living) component of a given area. Communities interact with their physical environment, including abiotic (non-living) factors like soil, water, and climate, within an ecosystem, a dynamic system of biotic and abiotic components. Similar ecosystems combine into biomes, such as forests or grasslands, which collectively form the biosphere, encompassing all life on planet Earth. This integrated hierarchy ensures functionality, adaptability, and survival of life. Figure290.1.2.cells_image_008.jpg.
