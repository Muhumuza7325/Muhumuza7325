Theme ***Mining and manufacturing in East Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 12 ***MINING IN EAST AFRICA*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner knows where minerals are found in East Africa, and understands the methods used to extract them, the factors that favour mining and its contribution to the East African economy. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand what a mineral is and why some minerals are valuable (u); b) locate the main mining centres on the map of East Africa (s); c) know the main minerals occurring in East Africa and their amounts (k); d) understand the use of mineral resources in the development of any two industries in Uganda (u); e) understand the methods of mining used for different minerals and their problems (u); f) draw flow diagrams to show the main stages and methods of mining (s); g) recognise types and consequences of mining on photographs (s); h) understand the effects of mining on the environment (u); i) appreciate the positive and negative contribution of mineral resources to development (v, a); j) appreciate that the benefits of mining often go mainly to overseas companies or a local elite only (a, v, gs); k) understand the physical and economic problems facing mining (u); l) appreciate the need for strict laws to control mining physically and economically (a, v, gs). Minerals and mining • Use five minutes to work in pairs to name things in the classroom or things you use made of minerals. • Feedback to the whole class. • explain what a mineral is and give examples of minerals in East Africa. • In pairs, group objects and artefacts that you might find in your community into minerals and non-minerals. Feed your ideas into a whole-class discussion. • Are all minerals valuable? What is the difference between a valuable mineral and other minerals? • Understand that although all rocks are made of minerals, mining is only concerned with minerals which are valuable because they have uses. • Present a map of the main mining sites in East Africa, and the minerals mined. You can look up the map on Internet. • Using the map of the main mining sites, work in pairs to make a list for each East African country in four columns: name of mineral, mining sites, uses of mineral, exported or used locally. (Note this should show only main minerals not every mineral and site). • In pairs, compare your list with another pair to explain what the map and the list you have made show. Factors affecting mining • Note that not all valuable minerals are worth mining • In groups, discuss and suggest factors which may affect whether a mineral is mined or not. • Conduct class feedback from groups and supplement where necessary. Types of mining. Open cast • Use a photograph and draw a diagram of an open cast mine. use the diagram to describe the mining. • convert the diagram of an open cast mine into a flow diagram showing the stages of mining. • Working in small groups and using the map showing the main mining sites, list examples of open cast mining in East Africa. • suggest the advantages and possible dangers of open cast mining; including how this might damage the environment. • Compare your ideas with other groups, and then conduct whole-class discussion. Underground mining • Using the map showing the main mining sites, list minerals mined underground in East Africa. • Use a photograph and draw a diagram of an underground mine (Kilembe copper?) and describe the method of mining. • convert the diagram of an underground mine into a flow diagram to show the stages of mining. • suggest the advantages and possible dangers of underground mining; including how this might damage the environment. • Explain why Kilembe underground mine stopped for a long while and find out whether it has been re-opened. Extraction of oil • Draw a series of diagrams to show the stages in the extraction of oil. You can look this up on Internt. convert the diagrams into a flow diagram to summarise the stages of mining. • suggest possible problems of oil extraction, how this might damage the environment and how the damage can be prevented. • discuss the problems of ownership of land where the oil is found and compensation of the landowners. Who benefits from mining? • Explain the British system of ownership of minerals now used in Uganda. • suggest why development of mining, including oil extraction, is very expensive. • suggest why, in East Africa, mining is mainly done by overseas companies. • Do local people always benefit from mining and if not, why? • Understand that in many countries the mines are owned by overseas companies and they pay taxes to the government. And that sometimes, taxes are diverted to rich people through corruption. • This sometimes means that ordinary people in the country, including those owning the land where the minerals are found, may get little or no benefit, since all the money goes to overseas companies or to important members of the government and other rich people. • suggest how corruption can be prevented so that all people can benefit from mining.
