[Assignment 1] {Identify some chemical reactions and explain what a chemical reaction is, what a rate of a chemical reaction is and cover in depth, the collision theory}. To begin, let's recall what we studied in our senior one. We did cover some chemical reactions. We burnt elements in air, dissolved elements in water, covered rusting, did preparation of Oxygen and Hydrogen in the laboratory, among many others. Think about the numerous chemical reactions that were covered in senior two; the precipitation reactions to form insoluble salts, the displacement reactions, double displacement reactions, combination reactions, redox reactions and decomposition reactions that involved heating compounds, among many others. And we can’t forget the organic chemistry reactions covered in our first term in senior three. What did we define as a chemical reaction back then? Chemical reactions are the fascinating dance of change at the molecular level. They involve one or more substances, called reactants, undergoing a transformation. These reactants can be fundamental building blocks like elements (think of hydrogen or copper) or more complex combinations known as compounds (like water or sugar). Reactants can even be dissolved in water to form aqueous solutions, which also participate in these reactions. Chemists sometimes use the term "reagent" specifically for reactants in solution. During a chemical reaction, the bonds between the atoms in the reactants break and rearrange, forming entirely new substances called products. These products have different properties and chemical structures compared to the starting materials. Chemical reactions are the driving force behind countless natural phenomena and technological advancements, from the burning of fuel to the synthesis of life-saving medications. A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more chemical substances called reactants combine or break down to form new substances called products. Chemical reactions can be sub divided into classes, each of which has its own characteristics. The main classes of chemical reactions include combination, decomposition, single displacement, and double displacement reactions. Combustion reactions are a special type of combination reaction, while acid-base neutralization reactions are a special type of double displacement reaction. Note that some reactions can even fall into multiple categories. Combination: This takes place when two or more substances combine to form a single substance. E.g., when iron is heated with sulphur to form iron (II) Sulphide. Fe(s) + S(s) → FeS(s). When lead (IV) oxide is lowered into a gas jar of sulphur dioxide, they combine and form lead (II) Sulphate. PbO₂(s) + SO₂(g) → PbSO₄(s). Combination reactions can also be called synthesis reactions. Decomposition: This occurs when a compound splits up into simpler substances. This change usually takes place without the presence of a second substance and very often the action of heat is sufficient to cause the reaction to take place. E.g., when calcium carbonate is heated in a crucible to bright red, it decomposes to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g). While heat is a common trigger, it's not always necessary for decomposition to occur. Light or electricity can also initiate decomposition in some cases. Displacement: Displacement Reactions are of two main types: i) Single Displacement: This occurs when one element (or group) takes the place of another element (or group) in a compound. E.g., if zinc is placed in copper (II) sulphate solution, copper is displaced by zinc and zinc sulphate is left. Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s). When chlorine is bubbled through a solution of potassium bromide, the chlorine displaces bromine and red bubbles of bromine are formed. All that is left is a solution of potassium chloride. 2KBr(aq) + Cl₂(g) → 2KCl(aq) + Br₂(g). ii) Double Displacement (also called Double Decomposition): In this reaction, two ionic compounds undergo a mutual exchange of their constituent ions, resulting in the formation of entirely new ionic compounds. Think of it as a rearrangement, where cations and anions trade partners to create new structures. It's important to note that while aqueous solutions are often involved, particularly for one or both reactants, solid reactants can also participate in double decomposition reactions. The products formed can take various forms: Soluble Products: This is a common outcome. Both products formed in the reaction can be soluble and remain dissolved in the solution. This frequently occurs when the resulting ionic compounds are highly soluble in water. Examples include: The reaction between potassium nitrate (KNO₃) and sodium sulphate (Na₂SO₄), which forms potassium sulphate (K₂SO₄) and sodium nitrate (NaNO₃) (both soluble). Neutralization reactions, where an acid (ionic compound) and a base (ionic compound) exchange their ions to produce water (H₂O) and a salt (another ionic compound). Since the resulting salt is often highly soluble, neutralization reactions fall under this category. An example is the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which forms water and sodium chloride (NaCl) (both soluble). Precipitation: An insoluble solid product, called a precipitate, forms and separates from the solution. Precipitates are frequently the desired product in many reactions. For example, silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and sodium chloride (NaCl) are both soluble in water. When they react, they form insoluble silver chloride (AgCl), which precipitates as a solid. All salt metathesis reactions involve precipitation, but not all precipitation reactions are salt metathesis. Salt metathesis is a specific type of precipitation where the focus is on the formation of a new salt through ion exchange. Gas Evolution: In some cases, a volatile (easily vaporized) product forms and escapes the solution as a gas. This often occurs when one of the products is a weak acid, like carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), or a volatile compound like hydrogen chloride (HCl). An example is the reaction between sodium chloride (NaCl) and sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄), which forms sodium hydrogen sulphate (NaHSO₄) and hydrogen chloride gas (HCl). NaCl(aq) + H₂SO₄(aq) → NaHSO₄(s) + HCl(g). By understanding the solubility of the products, one can predict the outcome of a double decomposition reaction. Reversible reactions: Most reactions proceed in only the forward direction until when one of the reactants or all the reactants are used up, and then the reaction stops. Such a reaction is known as an irreversible reaction. E.g., the reaction of Hydrogen and Oxygen to form water. H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) → H₂O(l). However, there are some reactions in which the direction of a chemical change can be reversed by changing the conditions under which the reaction is taking place. The reaction can proceed in both forward and backward directions depending on the conditions to which the reaction is subjected i.e., the products can react to form back the substances that were initially reacting. Such a reaction is known as a reversible reaction. E.g., when hydrated copper (II) sulphate is heated, the blue colour of the crystals changes to white due to formation of anhydrous copper (II) sulphate. CuSO₄.5H₂O(s) → CuSO₄(s) + 5H₂O (l) [(blue crystals) → (White powder)]. However, the white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate can be turned to blue hydrated form by adding water to it drop by drop. CuSO₄(s) + 5H₂O (l) → CuSO₄.5H₂O(s) [(white powder) → (blue crystals)]. The two equations above can be written as one: CuSO₄.5H₂O(s) ↔ CuSO₄(s) + 5H₂O(l). Other examples of reversible reactions: N₂O₄(g) ↔ 2NO₂(g); N₂(g) + H₂(g) ↔ 2NH₃(g); 3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g) ↔ Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g). I hope you recall us covering the reactivity series in depth. Back then, we discovered that some chemical reactions take place very fast while others are slow. In this very chapter, our main objective is to cover in depth the rates of chemical reactions. During a chemical reaction, there are three main events that usually occur. (i) The reactants (substances at the start) get used up and new substances (products) form in their place. (ii) Heat energy is either evolved (exothermic reaction) or taken in (endothermic reaction). (iii) For a fixed amount of reactant(s), a fixed amount of product(s) is eventually formed. Rates of reaction (kinetics) and equilibrium: When we talk of rate, time is a factor that is being considered. Rate refers to the change of an activity in a given time. Rates of reactions indicate how fast reactions are occurring. Some reactions occur very rapidly e.g., explosions and precipitation while others occur very slowly e.g., rusting and fermentation. Some reactions proceed at a moderate rate e.g., the reaction between hydrochloric acid and zinc metal. Kinetics is a branch of Chemistry that deals with the study of rates of chemical reactions. Rate of a chemical reaction is the amount of the products formed per unit time or is the amount of reactants consumed or used up per unit time. Rate = Amount of products formed or Amount of reactants used up / Time taken. Units for rate of reaction are moles/litre/second i.e., mol/L/s. During a chemical reaction, the concentration of reactant(s) decreases while that of the product(s) increases. The concentration of the reactant(s) decreases because they are being used up to form product(s) and the concentration of product(s) increases until a maximum point when it remains constant, implying that all reactant(s) have been used up. Below is a graph of products formed against time. Figure69.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_001.jpg. At the beginning, the amount of the product is low and increases as time goes on. As the reactants get used up, the reaction slows down and when there are no more reactants, the reaction stops and the curve becomes horizontal/constant. At the point where the curve becomes horizontal, it means that the maximum amount of the product has been formed. Now, why study rates of reactions? Understanding reaction rates empowers chemists to unlock a treasure trove of knowledge. From designing new chemical substances such as faster-acting drugs and optimizing industrial processes, to predicting reaction outcomes and unravelling reaction mechanisms, reaction rates serve as a key. This knowledge even extends to developing new materials with desired properties. Studying reaction rates goes beyond just speed; it's the compass guiding chemists to control, predict, and design the future of chemical transformations. One can then wonder why reactions occur. This can be explained in terms of the collision theory of a chemical reaction. The collision theory of a chemical reaction states that a reaction occurs when the particles involved in the reaction collide together in the right way and if they have the appropriate energy or right energy. This energy is called activation energy. Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required by the reactant molecules to change into products. This energy exists in reactant molecules in form of potential energy. The smaller the activation energy, the faster the rate of reaction and the greater the activation energy, the slower the rate of reaction. Meaning, reactions may not take place if reactant molecules have energy less than activation energy or if reactants don’t collide in the right way. Now we come to our very first objective. Video34.Activation_energy.mp4. Having known that reactions do occur at different rates, how then can one determine the rate of a chemical reaction. The rate of reaction can be determined by: 1. Measuring the volume of a gas evolved/given out per unit time. This method is for reactions where a gas is being produced. 2. Measuring mass of reactants remaining with time/measuring change in mass. This can be illustrated by the graphs below: (i) When volume is to be measured. Figure70.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_002.jpg. (ii) When mass is to be measured. Figure71.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_003.jpg. From the above graphs, the rate of reaction at any time is determined by calculating the gradient of the tangent of the curve at that time. Figure72.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_004.jpg. From the graph, the rate of reaction at time, t = Change in volume = b / Change in time = a. The following examples of reactions can be used to determine the rate of chemical reactions. Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). The rate of this chemical reaction can be obtained by collecting and measuring the Volume of the hydrogen gas produced. In such a case, to determine the maximum volume of hydrogen gas possible, the mass of Zinc is kept constant. This ensures the zinc acts as the limiting reactant and is completely consumed before the hydrochloric acid (present in excess) is depleted. If too much zinc is used, some may not react, leading to an underestimation of the maximum hydrogen gas production potential. Conversely, using too little zinc can lead to its complete consumption before all the acid reacts, resulting in an overestimation of the maximum hydrogen gas volume. This principle of controlling the reactant amount is crucial for obtaining reliable results in many chemical reactions. CaCO₃(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl₂(aq) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g). The rate of this chemical reaction can be obtained by collecting and measuring the Volume of the carbon dioxide gas produced. 2H₂O₂(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + 2O₂(g). Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs in the presence of manganese (IV) oxide as a catalyst. The rate of this reaction can be determined by collecting and measuring the volume of oxygen gas evolved. Figure72.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_104.jpg. N.B: In all the above reactions, the rate of the respective reactions can also be determined by measuring the Change in mass of the reactant(s) with time. • You can use an online or downloaded simulation to illustrate key aspects of chemical reactions. [Assignment 2] {Explain in detail, the effect of various factors on the rate of chemical reactions}. Factors affecting rates of reactions: The 6 major factors affecting rates of reactions are concentration of the reactants, temperature, surface area, pressure for gaseous reactions, presence of a catalyst and light for photochemical reactions. The above factors can either increase or decrease the rate of reaction depending on the type of the reaction. 1. Concentration of reactants. Concentration of the reactants refers to how close together the solute particles are, in a given solution. Generally, an increase in the concentration of the reactants increases the rate of a chemical reaction and a decrease in their concentration decreases the rate of the reaction. According to the collision theory, reactants must first collide before products form, thus the higher the concentration, the higher the frequency of collisions per unit time and the faster the products are formed. Conversely, lower concentrations lead to fewer collisions and a slower rate of reaction. An experiment to show the effect of concentration of reactants on the rate of reaction. Consider a reaction between zinc and dilute hydrochloric acid. Procedure: First, a known mass of zinc particles is added to 1M hydrochloric acid in a conical flask fitted with a graduated syringe set at point zero. The stop clock or stopwatch is then immediately started and the volume of hydrogen gas evolved is measured at regular intervals until a constant volume is registered by the syringe. The recorded results in regular time intervals are then plotted in a graph of volume of hydrogen collected against time. Diagram of the setup. Figure73.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_005.jpg. The experiment is repeated using the same mass of zinc powder but with 0.5M HCl. Results are then plotted. Figure74.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_006.jpg. It is found out that the curve for 1M HCl is steeper than that of 0.5M HCl. Also, the horizontal part for the curve of 1M HCl begins earlier showing that the maximum value of hydrogen gas is evolved faster at a higher concentration. Therefore, the rate of reaction is higher at a higher concentration. NB: Magnesium can be used instead of zinc (the concentration of hydrochloric acid is varied and that of magnesium kept constant). Procedure: First, a known mass of Mg and a known volume of dilute hydrochloric acid in a test-tube tied with a thread, are placed in a conical flask and the experiment is set up as shown below. Figure74.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_106.jpg. The stopper is opened for a moment so that the thread is free. The test-tube drops, pouring HCl into the conical flask. At the same time, the clock is started. The volume of hydrogen in the syringe is recorded at regular intervals until the reaction is complete. (Refer to the notes above for the next steps). Instead of measuring the volume of hydrogen gas produced, we may measure the mass of reactants. Procedure: About 10g of zinc powder is carefully added to 1M HCl in a conical flask and weighed. Next, a stop clock is immediately started as the zinc powder is added to HCl in the flask. The change in weight of reactant is directly taken from the top pan balance in a given time interval. The mass of the flask and the reactants is measured at regular time intervals. The mass of the flask and its contents is plotted against time. Figure76.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_008.jpg. The experiment can be repeated using the same mass of zinc and the same volume of HCl with different concentration. Below is graph of mass of flask and its contents against time. Figure77.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_009.jpg. The effect of concentration can also be demonstrated using the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosulphate solution. Sodium thiosulphate reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce sulphur, sulphur dioxide, water and sodium chloride. Sulphur produced during the reaction makes the solution appear cloudy. Na₂S₂O₃(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) + S(s). S₂O₃²⁻(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) → SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) + S(s). Safety Precautions: Wear safety glasses and gloves while handling hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is corrosive. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Dispose of waste according to your school or institution's guidelines. Procedure: Measure 60cm³ of sodium thiosulphate solution and pour it into a beaker placed on a white paper marked with a cross (in blue or black ink). Add 5cm³ of 2M hydrochloric acid to the solution and at the same time start a stop clock, swirl carefully the mixture then leave to stand on paper. Note the time taken for the cross to disappear. Repeat the experiment by varying the volume and concentration of sodium thiosulphate i.e., 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 cm³ of the original sodium thiosulphate solution and making the total volume up to 50cm³ each time by adding distilled water. Record the results in the table. Figure77.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_109.jpg. Specimen results: Volume of Na₂S₂O₃(cm³) 60 50 40 30 20 10. Volume of H₂O(l) (cm³) 0 10 20 30 40 50. Volume of HCl (cm³) 5 5 5 5 5 5. Time for cross to disappear (s) 27 18 31 35 70 147. State why the cross disappears in this experiment. The cross disappears because the reaction between dilute HCl and Sodium thiosulphate forms a precipitate of Sulphur which renders the mixture opaque. In essence, the cross doesn't physically disappear, it simply becomes obscured from view due to the increasing cloudiness caused by the formation of the sulphur precipitate during the reaction. Write an ionic equation for the reaction. Plot a graph of: a) Volume of sodium thiosulphate against time. b) 1/t against volume of sodium thiosulphate. Deduce from the graph how the rate of reaction varies with concentration of Sodium thiosulphate. Explain the relationship between rate of reaction and 1/t. Although reaction rates (R) generally slow down with time (t) (R α 1/t), with the highest rate often occurring initially when reactant concentrations are at their peak, some complex reactions can deviate from this pattern. Analysing reaction rates involves plotting the reciprocal of time (1/t) against concentration, ideally yielding a straight line, signifying a direct proportionality between the rate and concentration. However, real-world scenarios can deviate due to factors like reactant consumption causing a curve, minimum concentration thresholds preventing a zero intercept, reversible reactions affecting the starting point, and complex reaction mechanisms influencing the rate profile. Despite these deviations, analysing 1/t versus concentration remains a valuable tool for understanding reaction kinetics. Video13.The_effect_of_concentration_on_reaction_rate_sodium_thiosulphate_and_hcl.mp4. 2. Temperature. Generally, an increase in temperature increases the rate of a chemical reaction and a decrease in temperature decreases the rate of a chemical reaction. As temperature increases, more reactant molecules acquire activation energy resulting into an increase in the number of collisions per unit time. It can be demonstrated by considering the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosulphate. Procedure (Check notes above). This can be explained by the graph below. Figure78.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_010.jpg. 3. Surface area. In the context of chemical reactions, surface area refers to the accessible portion of a reactant that can interact with other reactant molecules. In chemical reactions, the more surface area the reactants have, the faster they typically react. This relates to the collision theory, where a reaction's speed depends on frequent collisions with enough energy. By grinding solids, dissolving them (if soluble), or using smaller particles overall, we increase the exposed surface area. This provides more opportunities for reactant molecules to come into contact with each other, increasing the likelihood of successful collisions and potentially leading to a faster reaction rate. The effect of surface area on reaction rate can be investigated by observing the reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid. In this experiment, powdered and lump calcium carbonate (same mass each) are exposed to dilute hydrochloric acid. The volume of carbon dioxide gas evolved is measured at set time intervals for both scenarios. Plotting this data allows comparison. A graph of volume of carbon dioxide gas evolved from both experiments is plotted against time on the same axes. Due to the larger surface area of powdered calcium carbonate, collisions with acid molecules are more frequent, leading to a faster reaction rate and a steeper slope on the corresponding graph compared to the lump calcium carbonate. This effectively demonstrates collision theory: That with more surface area, successful collisions and reaction rate increase. Figure79.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_011.jpg. What do you think is X, Y and Z? X- large marble chips. Y - Small marble chips. Z - Powdered marble chips. Figure80.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_012.jpg. Once again, what do you think is X, Y and Z? A - Powdered marble chips. B - Small marble chips. C - Large marble chips. Figure81.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_013.jpg. Specimen results: Mass of calcium carbonate (g) 50 30 35 20. Time (s) 100 150 170 200. Plot a graph of mass of calcium carbonate against time. From your graph, choose any given time of your choice and calculate the rate of reaction at that time. As always, the gradient or slope of the curve at any instant gives the rate of reaction at that point, and instead of plotting the volume of gas evolved against time, the mass of the solid reactant could be plotted against time as shown above. Similarly, the reaction between magnesium ribbon and dilute Sulphuric acid is slower compared to the reaction between magnesium powder and dilute Sulphuric acid. This is so because magnesium ribbon has bigger particles, thus a small surface area exposed to the reaction with dilute Sulphuric acid. Magnesium powder has smaller particles, thus a large surface area exposed to the reaction with Sulphuric acid. With more surface area available, there are more opportunities for collisions between reactant molecules, leading to a faster reaction, thus, the rate of reaction is faster when magnesium powder is used. Question: When a certain volume of 0.1M hydrochloric acid was reacted with excess iron fillings at room temperature, 120cm³ of a gas was produced. (a) Draw a well labelled diagram to show how the rate of reaction was determined. (b) Write an equation for the reaction. (c) Calculate the: (i) Volume of 0.1M hydrochloric acid required to produce the 120cm³ of the gas. (ii) Mass of iron fillings that reacted. (d) Draw a sketch graph of volume of the gas against time. (e) State how the rate of reaction would change if the reaction was carried out at a temperature above room temperature. 4. Pressure: Pressure plays a crucial role in influencing the rate of chemical reactions. It primarily affects gaseous reactions because gas particles are highly compressible. When pressure increases, gas molecules are squeezed into a smaller volume, leading to more frequent collisions. This can increase the reaction rate according to the collision theory, where frequent collisions with sufficient energy are necessary for a reaction to occur. The Haber process, which uses high pressure for ammonia synthesis, exemplifies this principle. It's important to note that while pressure has the most significant effect on gases, it can also slightly influence the rate of reactions in liquids and even some solids at extremely high pressures. However, these effects are generally much smaller compared to the dramatic changes observed in gas phase reactions. 5. Presence of a catalyst: Catalysts are remarkable substances that increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed themselves. They work by lowering the activation energy, the minimum energy required for the reaction to proceed. This allows reactants to overcome the energy barrier more easily, leading to a faster reaction. By acting like efficient matchmakers, catalysts bring reactants together in a way that facilitates their interaction and speeds up the overall process. Powdered catalysts, with their larger surface area, often provide more sites for reactant molecules to interact, leading to a faster reaction compared to bulkier forms. However, there's a limit to the benefit of adding more catalyst; once all the catalyst sites are occupied, adding more won't further increase the rate. Characteristics of catalysts: Catalysts remain chemically unchanged after a reaction, acting as reusable matchmakers that bring reactants together without being consumed. Catalysts are highly efficient, meaning small amounts can significantly influence reaction rates. Additionally, many catalysts exhibit specificity, meaning their structure allows them to interact effectively with particular reactants, facilitating that specific reaction. While not universally applicable, some catalysts can be further boosted by specific substances called promoters or co-catalysts, enhancing their activity or selectivity. Catalysis (the process of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction using a catalyst) comes in two flavours: 1) Homogeneous Catalysis: In this type, the catalyst and the reactants are in the same phase, typically a liquid or a gas. For example, in the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar), enzymes act as homogeneous catalysts because they're dissolved in the same water solution as the sucrose molecules. 2) Heterogeneous Catalysis: Here, the catalyst is in a different phase than the reactants. A common scenario is a solid catalyst interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants. For instance, the catalytic converters in cars use metals like platinum as heterogeneous catalysts to convert harmful pollutants in exhaust gases. The effect of a catalyst on the rate of reaction can be illustrated by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The rate can be determined by measuring the volume of oxygen liberated at different regular time intervals. The experiment is then repeated using the same volume of hydrogen peroxide but with no catalyst. The graph of volume of oxygen against time is then plotted. The experiment with the catalyst should show a steeper slope on the graph, indicating a faster rate of oxygen production. Figure82.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_014.jpg. Figure83.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_015.jpg. Examples of reactions and their catalyst(s). Catalysts play a vital role in accelerating or influencing numerous reactions. In the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, various metal oxides act as catalysts, including manganese (IV) oxide (MnO₂), lead (II) oxide (PbO), and copper (II) oxide (CuO). Copper (II) sulphate (CuSO₄) speeds up the reaction between zinc metal and dilute hydrochloric acid. Vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅) is the key catalyst in the Contact Process for converting sulphur dioxide (SO₂) to sulphur trioxide (SO₃), a crucial step in sulphuric acid production. The Haber process, which synthesises ammonia (NH₃) from nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂) gases, relies on iron (Fe) as a catalyst. Platinum (Pt) is a primary catalyst in catalytic converters, but other metals like palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) can also be used. Cracking of large hydrocarbon molecules for fuel production utilises acidic catalysts like aluminium oxide (Al₂O₃) or silicon dioxide (SiO₂), while zeolites are another class of catalysts used for this process. Nickel (Ni) is a common catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkenes, but other metals like palladium (Pd) can also be employed. Enzymes: Nature's master catalysts. Perhaps the most fascinating catalysts are enzymes, the biological catalysts within living organisms. These remarkable molecules, composed of proteins, can accelerate countless biochemical reactions. Each enzyme is highly specific, typically targeting one type or a class of reactions with remarkable efficiency. They operate best under specific conditions, often within a narrow temperature and pH range. Lactase, for example, efficiently breaks down lactose sugar in milk at human body temperature (around 37°C), while amylase in saliva functions best at a similar temperature to initiate starch digestion. Protease enzymes, crucial for protein breakdown, showcase the additional influence of pH. Pepsin in the stomach thrives in a highly acidic environment, while trypsin in the small intestine prefers a slightly alkaline one. Even fermentation, like the yeast-driven conversion of glucose to ethanol, relies on enzymes that function best within a specific temperature range (also around 37°C). Temperatures that are too low can render enzymes inactive, while excessively high temperatures can cause them to denature (lose their structure and function). Changes in pH can alter the enzyme's shape, hindering substrate binding and reducing reaction efficiency. 6. Presence of an inhibitor. While catalysts accelerate reactions, inhibitors act as their counterparts, slowing things down. These "negative catalysts" can bind to enzymes in two main ways: competitive inhibition, where the inhibitor mimics the real reactant and competes for the enzyme's active site (like vying for a parking spot), or non-competitive inhibition, where the inhibitor binds to a different site, affecting the enzyme's shape and hindering its ability to bind the true reactant. The more inhibitor present, the greater the slowdown. From regulating lactose intolerance to influencing brain chemistry with antidepressants, inhibitors play a significant role in controlling reaction rates within living systems. 7. Light: In some reactions, the rate of reaction is influenced by light. Reactions which are photosensitive (affected by light) are called photochemical reactions. Some important reactions that take place in presence of light include: (a) Photosynthesis: This is a fundamental process that sustains life on Earth. Green plants utilize sunlight as an energy source to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar (glucose) and oxygen. 6CO₂(g) + 6H₂O(l) → C₆H₁₂O₆(s) + 6O₂(g). This reaction is essential for plant growth and releases oxygen for respiration by other organisms. (b) Decomposition of Hypochlorous Acid: Chlorine water, used as a disinfectant, contains hypochlorous acid (HOCl). When exposed to direct sunlight, this acid decomposes into hydrochloric acid (HCl) and oxygen gas (O₂). 2HOCl(aq) → 2HCl(aq) + O₂(g). This reaction weakens the disinfecting power of chlorine water over time, highlighting the importance of storing it in dark containers. (c) Decomposition of Silver Chloride: This reaction showcases the dramatic impact of light on a chemical process. When silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions are mixed, a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms. Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s). However, upon exposure to light, silver chloride decomposes into metallic silver (Ag) and chlorine gas (Cl₂), causing the precipitate to darken. Figure84.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_016.jpg. In the absence of light, the precipitate remains white. This property of silver chloride is crucial in photography, where light exposure on a film containing silver halide crystals captures images. Silver bromide (AgBr) and silver iodide (AgI), similar to silver chloride, are also photosensitive, making them valuable in photographic films. Light sensitivity also explains why hydrogen peroxide and concentrated nitric acid are stored in dark-coloured bottles. Light can trigger decomposition reactions in these chemicals, altering their properties. Video41.How_to_speed_up_chemical_reactions.mp4. • In groups, plan, carry out and report on several investigations to find out how temperature, the concentration of reactants, and particle size affect the rate of chemical reactions. Also identify whether reactions can be reversed or not. Report on results and conclusions, making use of graphs to show patterns. Chemical balance/Chemical equilibrium: In reversible reactions, both forward and backward reactions can take place at the same time and the reaction might come to some kind of a balance in which the products and reactants are present at the same time. Suppose n molecules of substance A reacts with m molecules of substance B to form x molecules of C and y molecules of D as shown below: For a generalized reaction, nA + mB → xC + yD (where n, m, x, and y are stoichiometric coefficients). Stoichiometric coefficients are whole numbers that tell you the relative amounts of reactants and products involved in a reaction. As soon as a little of C and D are formed, a reverse reaction will begin. At first, the forward reaction will predominate, but, as C and D accumulate, the reverse reaction will build up until when an equilibrium position is reached with both the forward and backward reactions proceeding at the same rate. The composition of the mixture will appear to be constant, though it is the net result of the two opposing reactions. Equilibrium is a point in a reversible reaction when the rate at which reactants are forming the products is equal to the rate at which the products are dissociating to the reactants. Therefore, at equilibrium, both the reactants and the products are present. A reversible reaction is one which proceeds in both directions, that is, forward and backward. Temperature, pressure, concentration, and (to a lesser extent) catalysts can all influence the position of equilibrium in a reversible reaction. The effect of these factors on equilibrium is summarized by the Le Chatelier's principle. The principle states that when a chemical equilibrium is disturbed externally by a change in one of the factors upon which it depends, the equilibrium shifts in a direction so as to reduce the effects of that change. In other words, the system will adjust to counteract the external disturbance and restore equilibrium. Video42.LeChatelier's_Principle_Part_1.mp4. Video55.LeChatelier's_Principle_Part_2.mp4. Temperature: The Haber process is an example of how Le Chatelier's principle applies to temperature in a reversible reaction. Since the Haber process is exothermic (releases heat), increasing the temperature stresses the system by adding heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift in a direction that counteracts this stress and removes the excess heat. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the endothermic (heat absorbing) reaction, which is the decomposition of ammonia (backward reaction). Conversely, decreasing the temperature (cooling the equilibrium vessel) shifts the equilibrium to the right/favours the exothermic reaction, leading to a higher yield of ammonia. Pressure: In a gaseous system, an increase in pressure leads to a decrease in the volume of the gases involved and the reverse is true. In the Haber process, one volume of nitrogen combines with three volumes of hydrogen to produce two volumes of ammonia. The forward reaction occurs with a decrease in volume from four to two volumes. Though, while increasing pressure does decrease volume, Le Chatelier's principle considers the net effect on the total number of gas molecules. The principle dictates that if additional pressure is applied to the system, the equilibrium will shift to counteract the pressure change by favouring the reaction that reduces the total number of gas molecules to reduce the overall pressure. In such a case, the forward reaction is favoured; resulting in more ammonia being produced despite the decrease in volume. If the pressure of the system is decreased, the equilibrium shifts in the direction of an increase in the total number of gas molecules to increase the total pressure, favouring the backward reaction; resulting in more of the reactants being produced. Gaseous equilibrium reactions not affected by a change in volume, are not affected by pressure changes e.g., the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen to produce nitrogen monoxide. Generally, for gaseous equilibrium reactions affected by a change in volume, an increase in pressure or decrease in volume will favour the reaction that reduces the total number of gas molecules and a decrease in pressure or increase in volume shall have the opposite effect of increasing the total number of gas molecules. Concentration: When the concentration of a reactant is increased, the equilibrium shifts towards the product side to consume the excess reactant and restore balance. Similarly, adding more of another reactant pushes the reaction towards consuming the added species. For example, consider the reaction between ammonia (NH₃) and water (H₂O) to form ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH) at equilibrium: NH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) ↔ NH₄OH(aq). If we add more ammonia (NH₃) to the reaction mixture, the equilibrium will shift to the right to consume the excess ammonia and produce more ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH). Adding more ammonia (a reactant) disrupts the equilibrium, and the system responds by shifting the reaction towards the product side (ammonium hydroxide) to consume the excess ammonia and re-establish equilibrium. And, if a product is removed from the reaction mixture, the equilibrium will shift to replenish the missing product by consuming the remaining reactants. Catalyst: Catalysts don’t have any effect on the position of the equilibrium. In an equilibrium reaction, a catalyst increases the rate of both the forward and backward reactions, i.e., a catalyst enables equilibrium to be attained much faster than when there is no catalyst. [Assignment 3] {Explain in detail, the importance of reversible reactions in industrial processes}. Industrial application of chemical equilibrium: The idea of equilibrium is applied in some industrial processes. Ammonia is an important chemical that is manufactured in large amounts through the Haber process. It is produced from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. N₂(g) + 3 H₂(g) ↔ 2 NH₃(g) ∆H = -92 kJ/mol. The raw materials for the process are obtained from various sources e.g., Nitrogen gas is often obtained directly from the air (fractional distillation of liquid air) and hydrogen gas is obtained from the cracking of large hydrocarbons or steam reforming of natural gas. As the formation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen is a reversible process, reaction conditions are controlled to maximise the yield of ammonia. Ammonia is produced with a decrease in volume and therefore high pressure favours the forward reaction (ammonia formation) according to Le Chatelier's principle, as the forward reaction decreases the total gas volume. However, it is expensive to generate and maintain high pressures and have equipment that can withstand the extreme pressures. Considering these costs, the Haber process usually takes place at 250 to 500atm. The reaction is exothermic (∆H = -92 kJ/mol); Therefore, low temperature will favour the production of ammonia. However, these low temperatures are kinetically unfavourable as the reaction would proceed too slowly. Therefore, a relatively high temperature of about 450°C is used for a balance between the reaction rate and yield. The presence of a catalyst (iron), will give a sufficient reaction rate despite the moderate temperature. Since the reaction is reversible, a better yield of ammonia can be obtained by using any of the reactants in excess. However, in practice, nitrogen and oxygen are used in the ratio of (1:3) respectively. Using nitrogen in excess over hydrogen is more practical and energy-efficient. In general, a maximum yield of ammonia is obtained by using 4 conditions: (a) Very high pressure of 250 to 500 atmospheres; (b) Temperature of about 450°C; (c) Catalyst of finely divide iron; (d) Aluminium oxide/Alumina (Al₂O₃) is added to make the catalyst more porous increasing its surface area hence promoting its effectiveness. The ammonia gas produced is then liquefied and stored for future use. Video49.The_harber_process.mp4. Video53.What_Is_The_Haber_Process.mp4. Formation of sulphuric acid (A dense oily liquid) by the contact process: Sulphur dioxide and oxygen are the starting materials. The sulphur dioxide is oxidized to sulphur trioxide which is then absorbed by concentrated sulphuric acid forming oleum (fuming sulphuric acid) to which water is added to form the sulphuric acid. This process involves the following steps: i) Formation of sulphur dioxide. The sulphur dioxide can be obtained by: a) Burning sulphur in air; S(s) + O₂(g) → SO₂(g). This is cheap and produces sulphur dioxide in large quantities. b) Burning/roasting metal sulphides/sulphide ores in excess air, e.g. FeS(s) + O₂(g) → FeO(s) + SO₂(g); PbS(s) + O₂(g) → PbO(s) + SO₂(g). Other sources of sulphur dioxide include: Burning of hydrogen sulphide from crude oil in air, flue gas desulphurization (a process used to remove sulphur dioxide (SO₂) from exhaust flue gases produced by combustion processes, particularly in power stations and industrial facilities, playing a key role in reducing acid rain), etc. Oxygen is obtained from fractional distillation of liquid air. ii) Purification and formation of sulphur trioxide. The sulphur dioxide and oxygen are purified so that the catalyst is not poisoned by dust and impurities, they are then mixed together and reacted in the presence of a catalyst to form sulphur trioxide; 2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ↔ 2SO₃(g). Since the reaction is exothermic (∆H = -197 kJ/mol), the yield of sulphur trioxide is favoured by low temperature. In practice, a temperature of (450-500)°C is used. The rate of the reaction is increased by adding a catalyst (finally divided vanadium (V) oxide). Since the reaction forms fewer gas molecules (SO₃), high pressure favours the forward reaction (formation of SO₃) according to Le Chatelier's principle. In practice, the pressure used is between 1-10 atm, since the cost of maintaining high pressure is high. The catalyst (Vanadium (V) oxide) is so effective that 95% conversion of sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide is achieved at (450-500)°C and 1-10 atmospheres. The reaction produces enough heat to maintain the temperature of the catalyst. iii) The sulphur trioxide is then dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid to form fuming sulphuric acid (oleum), an oily liquid; SO₃(g) + H₂SO₄(l) → H₂S₂O₇(l). The Sulphur trioxide is not directly dissolved in water because it would react exothermically vapourising the sulphuric acid formed (i.e., producing a lot of mist consisting of dry droplets of H₂SO₄). iv) The fuming sulphuric acid is then diluted with water to form very concentrated sulphuric acid (about 98% concentrated); H₂S₂O₇(l) + H₂O(l) → 2H₂SO₄(l). Figure84.3.6.chemical_reactions_image_116.jpg. Video44.Manufacturing_Sulphuric_Acid. Manufacture of nitric acid (A colourless, fuming liquid of density, 1.5gcm⁻³). Nitric acid is manufactured by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to give products that are dissolved in water (The Ostwald’s process). Nitric acid is manufactured through 3 stages: 1) Catalytic oxidation of ammonia. Ammonia from the Haber process is burnt/oxidised in excess air over red-hot catalyst (platinum (90%)/rhodium (10%) gauze catalyst) to form colourless nitrogen monoxide (NO); The catalyst is heated to red hot to start the reaction but since the reaction is exothermic, no heating is required once the reaction starts. 4NH₃(g) + 5O₂(g) → 6H₂O(l) + 4NO(g). 2) The nitrogen monoxide is then rapidly cooled and reacted with excess air to form nitrogen dioxide in a crucial second stage; 2NO(g) + O₂(g) ↔ 2NO₂(g). This is a reversible reaction, meaning it can proceed in both directions. To maximize NO₂ formation, the process utilizes Le Chatelier's principle by employing excess air. This higher concentration of oxygen (O₂) pushes the equilibrium towards the product side. Additionally, rapid cooling after the first stage removes heat from the exothermic reaction, further promoting NO₂ formation according to Le Chatelier's principle. 3) The nitrogen dioxide obtained is then mixed with excess oxygen and bubbled through hot water to form nitric acid. Excess oxygen is used to prevent the formation of nitrous acid; 4NO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g) → 4HNO₃(aq). • Individually, research on examples of reversible reactions, including the reversible steps in the industrial manufacture of sulphuric acid, and explain using a flow chart;
