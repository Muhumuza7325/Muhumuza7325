Is it wrong to say that fossil fuels are energy resources formed from the preserved remains of ancient photosynthetic organisms such as plants, algae, phytoplankton, and certain photosynthetic bacteria that lived millions of years ago?;
Is it true that the 3 main fossil fuels are coal, petroleum/crude oil, and natural gas?;
Coal usually forms from terrestrial plant matter through compression and transformation in swampy environments, petroleum usually forms from aquatic organisms through chemical changes in sedimentary basins, and natural gas forms from thermal decomposition of organic matter in deeper, hotter underground formations. Could there be a false statement?;
Coal is a hard, black coloured substance formed primarily from compressed and decomposed plant matter. Its main components are carbon, hydrogen, and sulphur, with some oxygen and nitrogen present in smaller amounts. There are three major types of coal, each with distinct characteristics: Anthracite, Bituminous, and Lignite. Is this all true?; 
Anthracite is the highest rank coal. It is hard, brittle, and burns very hot and clean. It is the hardest type of coal. Bituminous is the most common type of coal, containing a moderate amount of carbon. Could there be a false statement?;
Bituminous coal is black and softer than anthracite. Lignite is the lowest rank coal, with the lowest amount of carbon and the highest moisture content. It is a soft, brown coal that burns less efficiently than other types. Is this all true?;
Can coal be processed industrially to obtain derivatives like charcoal, coke, coal tar and natural gas?;
Coal can be used to create steam that drives turbines and generators for producing electricity. Coke from coal is used in the production of steel. Syngas from gasification of coal is processed to produce chemicals such as methanol and ammonia. Is this all true?;
Fossil fuels can generate a lot of electricity at a single location. They can be found very easily. They are cost-effective. Transportation of oil and gas can be done easily through pipelines. They have become safer over time. Despite being an infinite resource, fossil fuels are available in plenty. Is this all true?; 
Burning fossil fuels releases harmful greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, a major contributor to climate change and acid rain. Extracting these fuels can be hazardous, leading to health problems like black lung disease in coal miners and respiratory issues in natural gas drillers. Fossil fuels are also a finite resource, meaning they will eventually deplete. Is this all true?;
