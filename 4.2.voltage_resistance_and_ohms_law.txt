Theme ***Electricity*** "@OMD". TOPIC 2 ***VOLTAGE, RESISTANCE AND OHM’S LAW*** "18 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should understand the concept of electrical resistance and apply Ohm’s law. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand electrical resistance, how it is measured, its relationship to current and voltage, and the factors that affect it (k, u, s); b) know the function and use of a diode, transistor, thermistor, LDR, LED and potentiometer (k, s). • In pairs, research on electrical resistance and the flow of current through a conductor. Plan and report on practical investigations to: • find the resistance of bulbs, heating coils, electric motors, and dry cells • measure current and voltage and apply Ohm’s Law to calculate resistance • use Ohm’s Law to predict current and voltage or resistance, before checking predictions with actual measurements • find the effective resistance when a number of resistors are connected in series and in parallel. • In groups, research, investigate, discuss, and report on the functions in a circuit of diodes, transistors, thermistors, LDRs, LEDs and potentiometers. Note: a) Emphasis should be put on the significant figures of ammeters and voltmeters; b) Derivation of the resistor network formulae is not required; only their uses/applications in solving numerical problems should be emphasised; c) Variety of practical activities involving ammeters, voltmeters, switches, bulbs and resistance wire are recommended.
