Theme ***Earth and Space Physics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 8 ***THE SOLAR SYSTEM*** "18 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should understand the relative movement of the earth and moon in relation to the sun and explain the consequences for the Earth. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the relative sizes, positions, and motions of the earth, sun and moon (k, u); b) understand how day and night occur and demonstrate the phases of the moon (u, s); c) understand the roles of the sun, earth and moon in explaining time, seasons, eclipses, and ocean tides (k, u, gs); d) know the components of the solar system and their positions (k); e) know the main characteristics of the inner and outer planets in the solar system (k); f) understand the various views about the origin and structure of the universe (k, v/a). • In pairs, research and explain on a poster; • how the Earth orbits around the sun and the moon around the Earth and the time taken for these orbits • the cause of day and night • why the shape of the moon appears to change over a period of time when viewed from the Earth • how the tilt of the Earth gives rise to seasons in some parts of the world • the implications of the above for activities on Earth. • In pairs, use a model to explain how the earth and moon move relative to the sun and use it to explain eclipses. • In groups, research, discuss and report on the connection between the moon and ocean tides. • In pairs, research and report on: • the components of the solar system, and make a scale model of the planets and place them in order showing their relative distance from the Sun • the main characteristics of the inner four and outer four planets • why the Earth is the only planet which supports life • In groups, research, discuss and explain, using an appropriate medium: • the asteroid belt and where it is found in the Solar System • the origin and structure of the universe. Note: a) use of ICT animations is required; b) the use of a globe and torch is recommended.
