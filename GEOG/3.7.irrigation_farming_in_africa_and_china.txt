Theme ***Forestry and irrigation in Africa and Other parts of the World*** "@OMD". TOPIC 24 ***IRRIGATION FARMING IN AFRICA*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands why irrigation is becoming particularly important in African farming, and the methods of small scale and large-scale irrigation. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand how problems of the physical landscape can be overcome with traditional or modern technology (u); b) recognise physical and other features on conventional survey maps and photographs (s); c) draw maps to show the areas of the case studies and graphs to illustrate their climates (s); d) know the parts of Africa where irrigation is most important and some examples of irrigation schemes (k); e) know one example of a large-scale irrigation scheme in Africa(k); f) understand why irrigation is becoming increasingly important in Africa (u); g) understand the factors leading to the development of the Gezira scheme (u); h) understand how the Gezira scheme works, its benefits and difficulties (u); i) use statistics and other information to analyse different aspects of the Gezira scheme (s, gs); j) appreciate the advantages of government cooperation with small scale farmers (v, a, gs); k) appreciate the dangers of corruption in government schemes (v, a, gs); k)ow the areas of China where irrigation is important and the main crops grown on irrigated farms (k); m) draw maps to show areas of the case studies, and graphs to illustrate their climates. (s); n) understand reasons for the importance of irrigation in China (u); o) understand the main methods of irrigation used in China (u); p) understand the principles and use of hydroponics (u); q) recognize and describe irrigation farming in China from photographs (s); r) appreciate the importance of rice growing and irrigation in China (v, a, gs); s) appreciate the lessons Uganda can learn from rice growing and the Gezira irrigation scheme (v, a, gs). The importance of irrigation and types of irrigation. • Revision: Why is irrigation important in Africa and becoming increasingly important? • Revision: Using pictures of different methods of irrigation, describe them. • Suggest which parts of Africa are most important for irrigation • work in pairs or groups to research examples of irrigation schemes and jointly contribute to a class map that has the schemes and their countries labelled. The Gezira irrigation scheme • Show a map of the position of the Gezira scheme in relation to the branches of the Nile and a climate graph of the Gezira area. Suggest why the Gezira scheme was built where it is and factors leading to its development. • look up Gezira irrigation scheme on Internet and describe what you find out. Use information from climate graphs and maps to create your own annotated map to help explain the location. Use photographs to investigate the type of irrigation method used. • investigate climate graphs over time and discuss present day issues of climate change. Work in groups to come up with ideas as to how this might affect irrigation in some areas. • Describe with diagram the organisation of the Gezira scheme as cooperation between government and smallholders. • Suggest the advantages of cooperation between government and local farmers. • Through discussion and questioning, understand the problems of the Gezira scheme. • suggest some of the problems of schemes organized by governments. Irrigation Farming in China; The Climate of China • Using a wall map, globe, and atlas show the position of China and describe its position. Build up a description of location through responses from your fellow learners. • Using a map showing annual rainfall, point out the wet areas, drier areas and very dry areas. • Show a climate graph of monsoon climate near coast. Describe climate (Wet, hot summers; cooler, dry winters). Which climate of East Africa is similar? (Savannah). • Look up monsoon on Internet. • Using a chalkboard sketch showing in-blowing winds in summer, out-blowing winds in winter, briefly explain the monsoon; as the reversal of wind movement. • Which season will be wet, and which one will be dry (Wet summers with in-blowing winds; dry winters without-blowing winds). • Understand how and why the amount of rainfall depends on the distance from the sea. • Summarise the regions: wet coastal plains, drier inland, Very dry in west, Cold in mountains. • collaborate to produce a “weather forecast” for a given region, using maps and charts and present it to the rest of the class. • Use the knowledge you have so far got about the climate of China to explain why irrigation is important in the country (monsoon climate with dry season; very dry areas inland away from coast). • Elicit from the main crop grown in China (rice). Why is irrigation important for growing rice (Land must be flooded). • Use a series of photographs of the stages of rice growing. Explain these and draw a flow diagram to show stages in growing rice (from land preparation to drying the seeds). • research using Internet or textbooks to locate key areas of rice growing in China and create your own sketch maps. Research some facts and images about the rice growing process at different locations. Why is rice called a labor-intensive crop. • Through questioning, explore other problems associated with rice growing in China. • Explain how hydroponics is used for growing rice in China. • Explain other crops grown in China e.g., wheat and corn in the drier areas. • compare the methods of irrigation used on the Gezira Plains and in China and suggest the one which is most suitable for Uganda. Give reasons for your suggestions;
