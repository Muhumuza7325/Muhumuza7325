Industrial development in China • Explain the importance of government policy in the development of industries in China: communist control of the economy and industrial development – the Great Leap Forward. Later government control of industrial development. • Work in groups to research facts about industrial development in China, using the Internet and other sources, and make a small presentation with maps and charts to illustrate the development.

(Cheap consumer goods, textiles, plastics; Electronic goods especially mobile phones and computers). • Explain the industries developed in China and changes in these: starting with heavy industries (iron and steel); consumer goods industries based on cheap labour; changes to more advanced technological industries as wages increased. • In pairs or groups, discuss and suggest the advantages for the development of industries China has: minerals and other raw materials; very large population for cheap labour and big market; education emphasising technical and industrial skills; government control and encouragement. • Can you name any projects in Uganda or other areas of Africa where Chinese are investing.
