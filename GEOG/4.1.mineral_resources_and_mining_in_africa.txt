MINING AND INDUSTRIALISATION IN AFRICA; AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. TOPICS 25 – 27: 36 PERIODS. Theme ***Mining and industrialisation in Africa; and Other parts of the world*** "@OMD". TOPIC 25 ***MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINING IN AFRICA*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner knows the main mineral resources in Africa; understands how minerals can contribute to the development of African countries. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the use of mineral resources in the development of any two industries in Uganda (u); b) recognise types and consequences of mining from photographs (s); c) appreciate the positive and negative contribution of mineral resources to development (v, a, gs); d) understand why most mining is capital-intensive (u); e) understand why much of the mining in Africa is controlled by overseas companies (u); f) draw a map to show the main mining areas of Africa (s); g) draw diagrams to show the main methods of mining (s); h) appreciate the dangers that most people may not benefit from mining in the countries where it takes place (v, a, gs). Minerals in Africa • Use a wall map, sketch map and/or atlas map or Internet map of mineral resources and mining areas in Africa. Draw the map and make a table to summarise countries with minerals and the minerals in each country. (Use the most important mining areas only, not an exhaustive list). • Revision: Using your knowledge about mining in East Africa (topic 15), draw diagrams to show the three main methods of mining: open cast, underground and oil extraction. Make a list of the problems of each method. • annotate photographs of mining, identifying the process in each and how it might affect the environment. Case studies • Case studies of mining areas: underground gold mining in South Africa; copper mining in Zambia and Congo; oil in Nigeria. Emphasise the social, economic and environmental problems: migrant labour in South Africa; landlocked area, transport problems and politics in Zambia/Congo; pollution in Nigeria (show photographs of pollution in the Niger delta). • Look up one of the above case study areas on the Internet. Economic benefits of mining • Suggest the possible economic benefits of mining to the governments and people (profits from taxes and exports, employment, infrastructure development, social service development). • Explain why these economic developments do not always benefit the people of the countries: mines owned by overseas companies who send profits overseas; poor wages paid to miners, especially formerly under apartheid; corruption when the rulers take all the profits and only a few people become rich e.g., Nigeria, Angola; pollution destroying people’s land e.g., Nigeria; political conflict partly caused by mining e.g., Congo, Biafra war, Zimbabwe. • Discuss the above problems and collaborate in groups to come up with recommendations and suggestions as to how we can ensure that most people in a country benefit from mining;
