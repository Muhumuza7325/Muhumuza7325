All the substances in our surroundings such as water, rocks, living things and stars are all composed of matter. Anything one sees, hears, smells, touches or tastes is matter. The study of matter is important because it guides us to classify substances. Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight. Matter exists in many shapes, colours, textures and forms. Is there any false statement?;
Matter is made up of very tiny particles known as ions, atoms or molecules. An atom is the smallest electrically neutral particle of an element that takes part in a chemical reaction. A molecule is the smallest electrically neutral particle of a compound or element that can exist on its own. An ion is an electrically charged particle of an atom or a group of chemically combined atoms after losing or gaining electrons. Are all the statements true?;
Most of us, on Earth, are familiar with the four fundamental states of matter i.e., solid, liquid, gas and plasma. At very high temperatures, molecules cannot exist. Most or all of the atoms are stripped of their electrons. This state of matter, a gaseous mixture of positive ions and electrons, is what is called plasma. A plasma is an ionized gas that is not a very good conductor of electricity and is not affected by magnetic fields. Are all the statements true?;
In addition to the four fundamental states of matter, there are several other states of matter which have been found theoretically and very few experimentally in space and time. Considering all the studies that have been done till 2023, there are 22 states of matter in total. Are the two statements true?;
To understand the properties of matter, one needs to look at the composition or particle nature of matter. Matter is indeed made up of small particles. The simple particle model of matter, commonly referred to as the kinetic theory of matter, provides a foundational understanding that substances are composed of tiny particles in constant motion. This theory explains the three states of matter. It states that all matter is made up of tiny particles and that these particles possess kinetic energy which causes them to be in a state of constant motion. The extent of the movement of particles depends on the amount of potential energy the particles have. Are all the statements true?;
The kinetic theory of matter has its limitations: It assumes particles are extremely small, neglecting their actual size: It simplifies particles as solid spheres, which may not accurately represent their actual shapes and sizes: It overlooks forces of attraction between particles: Its accuracy varies, being most precise for gases and less so for liquids and solids: It relies on ideal conditions, which may not always apply, especially for gases: It disregards small effects occurring at very low temperatures: It lacks a complete explanation for phase transitions, such as solid to liquid to gas: The theory struggles to explain complex systems like large molecules or mixtures. Are all the statements true?; 
The particles in solids are closely packed and orderly arranged. The particles in the solids are held together by a strong force of attraction which makes it difficult for the particles to move freely, thus solids do not flow. For this reason, solids are hard and strong. The particles in solids can only vibrate within a fixed position making solids to have a definite/fixed shape and volume. Solids have high melting and boiling points. Solids have very high density. Solids are practically compressible. Are all the statements true?; 
The particles in liquids are still closely packed but less closely packed than in solids. The particles have a less force of attraction than in solids. For this reason, they can move from one point to another freely thus liquids flow. They do not have a definite shape and volume but they can take the shape of the container in which they are put. Liquids are slightly compressible. Liquids are less dense compared to solids. Are all the statements true?;
The gas particles are widely separated with almost no force of attraction between the particles, thus gases are free to move in all directions, they do flow. The particles are in state of constant motion/random movement in all directions. They have a definite volume and shape but fill up the volume of the container in which they are put. Plasmas, like gases, have an indefinite shape and an indefinite volume. Gases are easily compressible. Gases are very light. Are all the statements true?; 
Particles in liquids and gases move. Brownian motion is the continuous random movement/motion of solid particles in liquids and gases. When pollen grains are poured in water, they are seen to be moving in a continuous random zigzag manner. When smoke particles are trapped in a glass cell and observed under a microscope, the particles are seen to be moving in a random zigzag manner. When a beam of light is directed into a dark room, the dust particles are seen to be moving in a continuous random manner. Are all these experiments right?; 
Particles in liquids and gases move. Diffusion is the spreading of particles or molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. When a crystal of potassium permanganate is placed in a beaker of water, the water turns pink/purple after some time. When an open a bottle of concentrated ammonia solution is placed at the corner of a room, the ammonia smell will spread throughout the room after some time. Is one of these two experiments right?;
The rate of diffusion of a gas depends on many factors. Generally, the lighter the gas, the higher the rate of diffusion. The lighter the diffusion medium, the faster the rate of diffusion. The steeper the concentration gradient, the higher the rate of diffusion. The smaller the surface area of diffusion, the higher the rate of diffusion. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of diffusion of the particles. Smaller particles diffuse faster than larger particles. The smaller the diffusion distance, the faster the diffusion. Are all these statements true?;
Sarah soaked a piece of cotton wool in concentrated hydrochloric acid and another piece of cotton wool in concentrated ammonia. She inserted the cotton wools with concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated ammonia at both ends of the glass tube simultaneously. She then closed each end of the tube with a cork. After some time, a white ring of smoke formed in the tube. Is it true that the white ring was formed closer to the end of the tube with cotton wool containing ammonia solution?;
The mass of gas, X is 17g. Gas, Y has a mass of 36.5g. Does gas, X diffuse faster than gas, Y?;
The importance of any state of matter depends on its capability to change from one state to another. The three main states of matter can be converted into the other when the conditions of temperature and pressure are changed. During the process of change from one state of matter to another, heat energy is always gained. Is there any false statement?; 
In summary, a change of state from solid to gas is sublimation. A change of state from gas to solid is deposition. A change of state from solid to liquid is melting. In a solid, the particles are closely packed and held by strong forces of attraction. When a solid is heated, the kinetic energy of the particles increases as they absorb the heat energy which weakens the forces of attraction between the particles. When the melting point is reached, the molecules break free and the solid changes to a gas. Is there only one false statement?;
A change of state from liquid to solid is freezing. A change of state from gas to liquid is called condensation. A change of state from liquid to gas is evaporation. In a liquid, particles can move about, but are still held together by weaker intermolecular forces. When a liquid is heated, the forces of attraction between the particles are weakened further until when they are completely broken, and at this point, the liquid changes to a gas. This is the boiling point of the liquid. Is there any false statement?;
Which of the following substances doesn't sublime? (a) Ammonium chloride (b) Potassium permanganate (c) Iodine (d) Dry ice;
Which of the following substances doesn't sublime? (a) Ammonium chloride (b) Anhydrous Aluminium Chloride (c) Anhydrous Zinc Chloride (d) Dry ice;
A pure substance is one which has distinct physical and chemical properties that are only unique to it. These physical and chemical properties can be reproduced at any time under the same conditions. Physical properties such as taste, smell, and colour of a substance cannot give accurate measurements of purity. For instance, sea water looks like pure water, impure naphthalene has the same smell of moth balls as pure naphthalene, and pure copper wire feels like a wire made of copper alloy. Are all these statements true?; 
The experiment for the investigation of purity must be carried out under the same conditions of pressure and temperature in which the standard values were obtained. The melting points of solids, density of solids and liquids, boiling point of liquids, freezing point of liquids and the refractive index for liquids can all be used to determine the degree of purity of substances. The experimental values of the above properties are compared to the standard values and if they coincide, then the substance being investigated is pure. Impurity raises the melting point and lowers the boiling point of any substance. Are all these statements true?;
The boiling point of a liquid is the constant temperature at which a liquid changes completely into vapour. Boiling takes place when the vapour pressure exerted by the liquid is equal to the external atmospheric pressure. A pure liquid will always boil at a constant temperature, for example, pure water boils at 100⁰C and pure ethanol boils at 78⁰C. The boiling point of a pure substance is higher than expected in the presence of impurities. Are all these statements true?;
To determine the boiling point of a liquid, the liquid sample is put in test tube/boiling tube with a thermometer held slightly above the liquid. The test tube/boiling tube together with its contents is transferred to boiling water in a beaker. The temperature of the vapour when it becomes constant is noted. This is the boiling point of the liquid. The thermometer is held above the liquid to avoid super heating i.e., a lower boiling point than expected can be achieved if the thermometer is dipped into the liquid sample. Are all these statements true?;
Alisha placed about 5cm³ of ethanol in a boiling tube and added some anti bumping stones. She suspended a thermometer to about 2cm above the surface of ethanol and placed the boiling tube in a beaker of water. She heated the beaker gently and recorded the temperature at which ethanol boiled/the temperature at which ethanol vapor condensed at the bulb of the thermometer and dropped back. She recorded that as the boiling point of ethanol. Are her steps fine?; 
The higher the atmospheric pressure, the higher the boiling point, this is because boiling takes place when the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure. The lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower the boiling point. Atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. The presence of dissolved impurity lowers the boiling point of the liquid e.g., water boils at 100⁰C and at a pressure of one atmosphere but water containing dissolved salts boils at a temperature lower than 100⁰C at one atmosphere. Are all these statements true?;
Melting point is the constant temperature at which a pure substance turns from a solid state to a liquid state at standard temperature and pressure. Each pure substance has its characteristic melting point at constant pressure. The melting point of a pure substance is normally sharp while that of an impure substance is not sharp. The presence of impurities tends to lower the melting point of a substance, for example, the melting point of ice water is 0⁰C but in presence of sodium chloride as an impurity, it melts at about 27⁰C. Are all these statements true?;
Freezing point is the constant temperature at which a pure substance turns from a liquid state to a solid state at a temperature of 0⁰C/273.15K and a pressure of 760mmHg/1atm/101.3kPa. For example, water freezes at 0⁰C when pressure is 760mmHg. Is there any false statement?;
He put a solid sample in a thin-walled capillary tube sealed at one end. The capillary tube with its contents was tightened to a thermometer and put in a beaker containing paraffin. The paraffin was heated with constant stirring until the solid just melted. This temperature was noted as the melting point of the solid sample. Was this an experiment to determine melting point of a solid substance?;
He placed some naphthalene in a boiling tube and inserted a thermometer in it. The boiling tube was then placed in a beaker of water. He gently heated the water in the beaker while stirring. When the naphthalene begun to melt, he stirred with the thermometer and noted the steady temperature at which the solid naphthalene melted. This was taken to be the melting point of naphthalene. He says that the water bath with a stirrer is used so as heat is distributed uniformly to all parts of naphthalene and that the water is heated gently to prevent it from bioling violently. Were some of the steps completely wrong?;
The presence of an impurity lowers the melting point of a substance e.g., pure naphthalene melts at 80⁰C but impure naphthalene containing benzoic acid melts at a temperature less than 80⁰C. A mixture of ice and common salt cools faster than pure ice because common salt acts as an impurity which lowers the freezing point of ice. Are all these statements true?;
Pressure affects the melting points of substances differently. Substances that decrease in volume when melted e.g., water, their melting points are decreased with increase in pressure. But substances that increase in volume on melting e.g., tin and paraffin wax, their melting points are increased with increase in pressure. Is it only the first statement that is true?;

Y is a region in which both solid and liquid naphthalene exists. Z is a region where liquid naphthalene exists. Are all these statements true?;

Along AB, the temperature of the solid naphthalene increases steadily as the solid naphthalene is heated. Along BC, the melting point is reached and the temperature remains constant. The corresponding temperature, T₀ is the melting point of naphthalene. The heat absorbed is used to break the intermolecular forces of attraction in solid naphthalene turning it into a liquid. Is there any false statement?;

When solid naphthalene has fully melted, allow the naphthalene to cool slowly in air while stirring with a thermometer. The constant temperature at which the liquid changes to solid is recorded as the freezing point of naphthalene. Unlike other substances, pure naphthalene has varying freezing points. Are all these statements true?;

S is the point at which cooling of solid naphthalene stops. Along PQ, temperature of the liquid naphthalene falls. Along QR, the freezing point of naphthalene is reached and temperature remains constant as liquid changes to solid. Are all these statements true?;

M is a region where there is both solid and liquid naphthalene. N is a region with solid naphthalene. Could there be any false statement?;
Understanding the principles of the kinetic theory, highlights the significance of solidification in preventing over cooling. When heating a beaker containing ice, the temperature remains at 0⁰C until all the ice has melted, as the added heat energy is utilized to break the forces holding the ice particles together. This gradual absorption of heat without a rise in temperature, known as the phenomenon of latent heat, is crucial in maintaining temperature equilibrium. On cooling water to ice, the water particles slow down and their kinetic energy is then given out as heat energy, which stops the water from cooling further. In this case, latent heat is given out. Are these statements accurate?;
Understanding the principles of the kinetic theory, highlights the significance of evaporation in preventing overheating. Land animals often lose water from their skin, mouth and nose by evaporation into the atmosphere. Sweat glands release sweat onto the skin's surface, and as it evaporates, it absorbs heat from the body, effectively cooling the skin and maintaining internal temperature within a narrow and optimal range. By carefully balancing heat loss through processes such as evaporation, radiation, conduction, and convection with heat gain through metabolism and activities such as exercise and shivering, the body maintains a consistent core temperature, ensuring optimal physiological function and comfort. Could there be any false statements?;
The application of heat to substances can induce various reactions beyond physical changes in their states of matter. Chemical reactions may occur, leading to the formation of new substances with different properties. The cold zinc oxide is white. It becomes yellow when hot, and becomes white again when cool. No change occurs and the substance is still zinc oxide. Sand does not change on heating, but any water in it may form water vapour. The purple potassium permanganate decomposes on heating and forms oxygen, which relights a glowing splint. Are all these statements true?;
In an experiment to investigate the rate of diffusion of lighter and heavier gases using a glass tube with a piece of cotton wool dipped in concentrated hydrochloric acid and another piece of cotton wool dipped in concentrated ammonia at opposite ends, John noted a ring form in the glass tube and he gave an answer that the ring is ammonium chloride and not condensed ammonia and chlorine gases. Could he be wrong?;
