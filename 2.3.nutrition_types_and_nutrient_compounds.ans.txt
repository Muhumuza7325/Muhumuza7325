Nutrition refers to the process by which living organisms obtain, consume and use food substances to sustain life processes. In green plants, essential nutrients include water, mineral salts and carbon dioxide, while in animals, they consist of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Is this all false?;
Macronutrients, such as carbohydrates for energy, proteins for tissue repair and muscle growth, and lipids for energy storage and insulation, are required in large quantities and provide the energy necessary for growth, metabolism, and other vital functions. Micronutrients, including vitamins for immunity and enzyme function, and minerals for bone formation, oxygen transport, and nerve function, are needed in smaller amounts but play crucial roles in physiological functions like immune response, bone health, and cellular production. Is this all true?;
Water is fundamental for hydration, temperature regulation, nutrient transport, and supporting metabolic processes. Dietary fibre, a digestible carbohydrate, is important for digestive health, maintaining bowel regularity, and supporting a healthy microbiome across various organisms. Is this all true?;
Autotrophs contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle and oxygen production, making them essential for maintaining the balance of life on Earth. Is it true that autotrophism/autotrophic nutrition is a mode of nutrition where an organism synthesises its own food from inorganic nutrients using an external energy source?; 
Photosynthesis is a type of autotrophic nutrition that involves organisms using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Examples of photosynthetic organisms include green plants, algae, some viruses and photosynthetic bacteria like cyanobacteria. Photosynthesis is the foundation of most ecosystems, providing the primary energy source for nearly all living organisms. Is this all true?;
Chemosynthesis is a type of autotrophic nutrition that involves organisms using energy from specific chemical reactions, such as the oxidation of inorganic compounds, to produce food. Examples of chemoautotrophs include chemosynthetic bacteria, such as those found in hydrothermal vents and sulphur-rich environments. These organisms play a crucial role in ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as deep-sea ecosystems. Is this all true?;
Heterotrophism/heterotrophic nutrition is a mode of nutrition whereby organisms obtain their food by consuming already manufactured organic compounds. Is it true that heterotrophs, incapable of making their own food, include all animals, fungi, and bacteria?;
Symbiosis is a process where organisms/symbionts live together in a close, often long-term, relationship that benefits at least one of the participants. The three main types of symbiosis are mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. In these symbiotic interactions, the benefit is always nutritional for both organisms. Could there be a false statement?;
Is it inaccurate to say that lichens consisting of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria, Rhizobium in the root nodules of leguminous plants, Protozoa in the stomachs of ruminants, bees and flowers, and bacteria in the human gut, all illustrate a mutualistic relationship?;
Is it true that in many commensal interactions, the benefit is often related to access to food, habitat, or transportation and that barnacles attaching to the shells or skin of whales, and remoras using sucker-like organs to attach to sharks, all illustrate commensalism?;
Is it inaccurate to say that tapeworms living in the intestines of mammals, fleas feeding on the blood of mammals, the Plasmodium parasites living in human red blood cells, mistletoe plants attaching to and penetrating the branches of trees or shrubs, and aphids feeding on the sap of plants, all illustrate prasitism?; 
Is it all true that macrophages, a type of white blood cell, engulf and digest pathogens like bacteria and viruses. That amoebas, single-celled organisms, use phagocytosis to consume food particles. That neutrophils, another type of white blood cell, rapidly respond to infection by engulfing and destroying harmful microbes. That in the aquatic environment, protists like ciliates use phagocytosis to capture and consume bacteria and other microorganisms for nutrition. That in plants, specialised cells can perform phagocytosis to remove dead cells or pathogens; 
Is it all true that Mucor, a common mould, grows on decaying organic matter such as fruits, vegetables and bread. That bread mould, another common mould, typically from the Rhizopus genus, also grows on bread and other starchy foods. That mushrooms decompose leaf litter, wood, and other organic materials in forests. That certain bacteria in soil decompose dead plants and animals. That in aquatic environments, chemosynthetic bacteria decompose dead organisms; 
Holozoic nutrition is a mode of nutrition, where complex organic food is ingested, digested into smaller molecules, absorbed into body tissues, assimilated/utilised by the body, and undigested materials are egested. Holozoic organisms are generally animals, plants and certain protozoa, such as some amoebas. Animals undergoing holozoic nutrition are classified into carnivores e.g., lions and elephants, herbivores e.g., cows and rabbits, and omnivores e.g., humans and pigs. Could there be only one right sentence?; 
Mixotrophic nutrition is a mode of nutrition where organisms obtain nutrients through both autotrophic and heterotrophic means. Mixotrophs can perform photosynthesis or chemosynthesis to produce their own food but can also ingest other organisms or organic matter when necessary. They include certain protists like Euglena, which can photosynthesise when light is available but also consume other organisms when light is scarce. Could there be only one right sentence?; 
Is it true that food is any substance that can be ingested, digested and absorbed by the body to maintain life processes. That organisms require food for various essential functions, including growth, respiration, repair, protection, regulation, maintenance, reproduction, and temperature regulation. That food includes traditional nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, as well as water, which, despite not being digested or providing energy or nutrients, is quite essential; 
Is it true that carbohydrates and lipids are energy-giving foods. That body-building foods, also known as growth foods, include dietary fibre. That protective foods include vitamins and minerals. That regulatory foods include proteins;
