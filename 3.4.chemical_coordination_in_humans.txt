Competency; The learner appreciates that there are organs in the body that secrete chemicals called hormones, which play vital roles in coordinating body functions. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) differentiate between hormones and enzymes (u); b) know and understand the effects of various hormones in the human body (k, u); c) know and describe the causes and symptoms of common hormonal disorders/diseases (diabetes, goitre and osteoporosis) in humans (k, u); d) appreciate the role of diet in managing hormonal disorders/diseases in humans (u). [Assignment 1] {Differentiate between hormones and enzymes}. Coordination and control refer to an organism's ability to detect and respond to changes in its internal and external environments, linking various bodily activities to function as a unified system. All living organisms are sensitive to environmental changes, known as stimuli, which can arise from within the body or its surroundings. The response to these stimuli depends on the coordinated action of the nervous (to be covered in the next chapter) and endocrine systems. Key terms under coordination include irritability, which is the capacity to detect and respond to stimuli; stimulus, a change that prompts a response; response, the organism's reaction to a stimulus; impulse, the nervous information conveyed along nerves; effectors, the cells or organs where responses occur; receptors, which detect stimuli and transform them into nervous impulses; internal environment, the immediate surroundings of cells, primarily tissue fluid in animals; external environment, encompassing the entire organism's surroundings; and glands, which are specialised tissues or organs containing secretory cells that produce and secrete chemical substances, such as hormones or enzymes, essential for various bodily functions. There are two main types of glands: endocrine and exocrine. Exocrine glands are equipped with ducts that transport their secretions directly to target organs or surfaces. For example, the salivary glands secrete saliva into the mouth cavity through salivary ducts, and sweat glands release sweat onto the skin. These glands play vital roles in processes such as digestion and thermoregulation. In contrast, endocrine glands are ductless and release chemical messengers known as hormones directly into the bloodstream. The blood transports these hormones to their respective target organs, enabling the glands to regulate various physiological functions. These hormones are transported by the blood to various target organs, cells, and tissues throughout the body, where they regulate numerous physiological functions. Together, these glands, along with hormone-producing cells and tissues, comprise the endocrine system. The glands are strategically located throughout the body, ensuring effective secretion and distribution of hormones that regulate essential processes such as growth, metabolism, and homeostasis. Examples of endocrine glands include the pineal gland, hypothalamus (which, while not a gland, plays a crucial role in hormone regulation), pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, thymus, adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, ovaries in females, and testes in males. These glands are situated in the head, neck, and trunk as shown in the diagram below: Figure323.chemical_coordination_in_humans_323.jpg. Note that the pancreas is unique because it functions as both an exocrine and endocrine gland, as it secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine (exocrine function) while also producing hormones like insulin and glucagon that regulate blood sugar levels (endocrine function). Similarly, the gonads (ovaries and testes) also serve dual roles by producing sex hormones and gametes, while the liver produces bile for digestion and regulates various hormones and proteins in the bloodstream. Hormones can be proteins, lipids (such as steroids), or derivatives of amino acids, and despite being effective in minute quantities, they exert significant effects on physiological processes. These chemical messengers bind to specific receptors on target organs or cells, enabling precise regulation of growth, metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis. Hormones can stimulate or inhibit activities in target organs, ensuring balance within the body. For instance, insulin lowers blood glucose levels, while glucagon raises them, highlighting their critical role in maintaining internal stability. Unlike nervous impulses, hormonal responses are slower and typically govern long-term changes such as growth and sexual maturity. Once hormones complete their function, they are transported to the liver, where they are metabolised into inactive compounds. This inactivation process prevents prolonged hormonal effects, ensuring that responses are time-limited and appropriately regulated. The endocrine system's precision and complexity underscore its importance in maintaining overall health and equilibrium. Similarities between hormones and enzymes: Hormones and enzymes are both biological molecules that play critical roles in regulating body functions. Both are produced by specific cells or tissues and are essential for maintaining homeostasis. They are effective in small quantities and act on specific targets to trigger or regulate biochemical processes. Hormones and enzymes are sensitive to temperature and pH, and their effectiveness can decrease if these conditions deviate significantly from optimal levels. Additionally, both are proteins or protein-based in nature (though some hormones, such as steroids, are lipid-based), and they contribute to the efficient coordination of physiological activities within organisms. Differences between hormones and enzymes: Hormones are chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands directly into the bloodstream, where they travel to distant target organs to regulate various physiological processes. In contrast, enzymes are biological catalysts produced by various cells, including those in exocrine glands, that accelerate specific chemical reactions at different locations within the body. While hormones exert their effects over a broader systemic range, affecting multiple body systems, enzymes operate locally to facilitate biochemical reactions necessary for metabolism and other cellular functions. Unlike enzymes, which directly facilitate or accelerate reactions, hormones regulate processes by stimulating or inhibiting activities in target cells. Importantly, enzymes can be reused multiple times in reactions without being altered themselves, which contrasts with hormones that can have effects based on their concentration and duration in the bloodstream. Furthermore, hormones can be proteins, lipids, or amino acid derivatives, whereas enzymes are strictly proteinaceous in nature. • In pairs, research on and discuss the meaning of hormone, and produce a table comparing hormones and enzymes. Share conclusions in class discussion and ensure all have clear understanding. [Assignment 2] {Explore the effects of various hormones in the human body}. The pineal gland primarily produces the hormone melatonin. Melatonin is involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles (circadian rhythms) and is produced in response to darkness, helping to promote sleep. Its secretion is influenced by light exposure, with levels typically rising in the evening and falling in the morning. The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, is an outgrowth that produces several hormones, many of which regulate other endocrine glands, earning it the title "master gland." It is closely connected to the hypothalamus via the pituitary stalk, allowing it to respond to signals from the brain and maintain hormonal balance in the body. It has two main parts: the anterior pituitary, which produces several hormones including growth hormone (GH), prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinising hormone (LH); and the posterior pituitary, which stores and releases hormones produced by the hypothalamus, specifically antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin. The anterior pituitary's hormone release is regulated by releasing and inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus, including thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) for TSH, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) for ACTH, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) for GH and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) for FSH and LH. Kisspeptin hormone stimulates the release of GnRH and is crucial for the initiation of puberty and regulation of reproductive functions. Prolactin release is primarily regulated by prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), also known as dopamine, but may also be influenced by prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH), which stimulates its secretion. Prolactin stimulates milk production in lactating females and also plays a role in regulating the menstrual cycle, supporting reproductive functions, modulating the immune system, and influencing behaviour and parental care. In females, luteinising hormone (LH) stimulates ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum (a temporary gland that produces progesterone to maintain the uterine lining for pregnancy), while in males, it acts as interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH) to stimulate the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) promotes the development of Graafian follicles in the ovaries, facilitating the maturation of eggs. As the follicles develop, they secrete oestrogens, particularly oestradiol. In males, FSH stimulates sperm production by acting on Sertoli cells in the testes, which produce androgen-binding protein (ABP). ABP binds to testosterone, ensuring a high concentration of this hormone in the vicinity of developing sperm cells, which is crucial for their maturation and overall fertility. Thyrotropin, also known as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triggers the thyroid gland to secrete thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as cortisol, which play roles in metabolism and stress responses. Growth hormone (GH) promotes the growth of bones, muscles, and tissues. If the growth hormone is produced in abundance during adolescence, the rate of growth increases throughout the whole body resulting into a large but proportional individual called a giant (gigantism). If over secretion of this hormone occurs in adults, new bone tissues are laid down especially in the arms and feet. The arms and feet become enlarged; a condition called acromegaly. If the pituitary produces little hormone during infancy, a condition known as pituitary dwarfism results and the individual is called a dwarf. This individual is short and stunted but intelligence and reproductive functions are not affected. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) regulates water reabsorption in the kidneys, maintaining fluid balance. A deficiency of ADH leads to a condition called diabetes insipidus. Oxytocin induces uterine contractions during childbirth, facilitates milk ejection during breastfeeding, and promotes social bonding and emotional regulation, playing a vital role in maternal behaviours and overall well-being for both mothers and infants. Thus, as the master gland, the pituitary controls numerous vital functions through the hormones it produces. The thyroid gland, located in the neck, produces thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which regulate growth, development, and metabolism. Triiodothyronine (T3), the more biologically active form of thyroid hormone, exerts a stronger influence on the body's metabolic rate and other physiological functions than thyroxine (T4), which primarily serves as a precursor to T3. In young humans, thyroxine plays a crucial role in growth and development, influencing various metabolic processes and supporting overall health during formative years. A deficiency of thyroxine or T3 in infancy results in cretinism, marked by stunted physical and mental development, which is treatable if diagnosed early. In adults, thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) play a vital role in regulating the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Imbalances in these hormones can lead to disorders such as hypothyroidism, characterised by symptoms like sluggishness, weight gain, swelling of the skin, dry skin, hair loss, low metabolic rate, and cognitive impairments. In extreme cases, myxoedema (a severe form of hypothyroidism) can progress to myxoedema coma, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention with thyroid hormone replacement. Conversely, excess production of thyroid hormones leads to hyperthyroidism, which causes symptoms of overactivity, weight loss, increased heart rate, anxiety, and an increased metabolic rate. In some cases, hyperthyroidism can also result in the protrusion of the eyeballs (exophthalmos), particularly in conditions such as Graves' disease. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of both thyroxine and T3, as they are composed of amino acids bound to iodine. A deficiency in iodine prevents adequate production of these hormones, prompting the thyroid gland to enlarge in an attempt to compensate, resulting in a condition known as goitre. In addition to these hormones, the thyroid gland produces calcitonin, which helps regulate calcium levels in the blood by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts—cells that break down bone—thereby promoting the deposition of calcium in bones and reducing calcium release into the bloodstream. The four parathyroid glands, located behind the thyroid gland in the neck, release parathormone, also known as parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium and phosphorus metabolism. When blood calcium levels are low, PTH is secreted to increase calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bones, enhancing intestinal absorption of calcium through the activation of vitamin D, and promoting renal reabsorption of calcium. Note that this action contrasts with that of calcitonin, produced by the thyroid gland, which lowers blood calcium levels. Together, PTH and calcitonin maintain calcium homeostasis in the body by balancing the levels of calcium in the bloodstream. Additionally, PTH reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, helping to maintain the balance of these minerals in the body. Disorders related to parathormone include hyperparathyroidism, in which excessive PTH production leads to elevated blood calcium levels (hypercalcaemia). This condition can result in weakened bones and the formation of kidney stones. Conversely, hypoparathyroidism occurs when there is insufficient PTH, causing low blood calcium levels (hypocalcaemia), which may result in muscle cramps, tingling sensations, and other symptoms. The thymus gland, located in the chest, is prominent in young mammals and diminishes in adults. It plays a crucial role in the immune system by producing thymosins, which stimulate the development of T-lymphocytes necessary for adaptive immunity. The adrenal glands, located atop each kidney, consist of the cortex (the outer part) and medulla (the inner part). The adrenal cortex secretes cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism by promoting gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources), breaking down proteins into amino acids, and mobilising fatty acids from adipose tissue for energy. Cortisol also helps the body respond to stress by ensuring adequate energy availability and suppressing excessive immune responses. Additionally, the adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid that controls sodium and potassium levels. When blood salt levels are high, the concentration of salt in the blood increases, which is detected by the hypothalamus as blood flows through it. In response to high blood salt levels, the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to decrease the production of aldosterone. This reduction leads to decreased reabsorption of sodium in the nephrons, resulting in increased sodium excretion in urine. Lower aldosterone levels also promote decreased potassium excretion, leading to higher potassium levels in the bloodstream. Conversely, when blood salt levels are low, the pituitary gland instructs the adrenal gland to release aldosterone, produced by the zona glomerulosa (the outermost layer of the adrenal cortex). This increase in aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys, thereby helping to retain sodium in the bloodstream, which is crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance. This action ultimately results in more concentrated urine. The adrenal medulla, under nervous control, produces adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in response to stress or excitement. Adrenaline triggers several physiological changes in the body to prepare it for "fight or flight" responses. It increases heart rate and breathing rate, ensuring that more oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the muscles. Adrenaline also dilates the pupils, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. It stimulates the conversion of glycogen stored in the liver into glucose, providing a rapid source of energy for the body, while also increasing respiration rates to meet heightened energy demands. Furthermore, adrenaline can cause piloerection, leading to the appearance of goosebumps. Noradrenaline complements these effects by narrowing blood vessels, which increases blood pressure and redirects blood flow to vital organs and muscles. This combination of hormones enhances physical performance, enabling an organism to either flee from danger or confront it effectively, ultimately increasing the chances of survival in stressful situations. The kidneys are considered part of the endocrine system, as they produce and secrete hormones that regulate various physiological processes in addition to their primary function of filtering blood and producing urine. Key hormones produced by the kidneys include erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow in response to low oxygen levels in the blood; renin, which is involved in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance by converting angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, into angiotensin I; and calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, which promotes calcium absorption in the intestines and helps maintain calcium and phosphate balance in the body. These hormonal functions underscore the kidneys' significant role within the endocrine system. The pancreas, which possesses both endocrine and exocrine functions, contains the islets of Langerhans, which are groups of specialised cells responsible for hormone secretion. Within these islets, beta cells secrete insulin, a hormone that lowers blood glucose levels by promoting the conversion of glucose into glycogen in the liver and facilitating the uptake of glucose by body cells for energy. A deficiency of insulin leads to diabetes mellitus, a condition characterised by elevated blood sugar levels, which is often managed through insulin injections or other medications. Conversely, alpha cells in the islets of Langerhans secrete glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen into glucose in the liver. In addition, the delta cells in the islets secrete somatostatin, a hormone that regulates the secretion of both insulin and glucagon, helping to maintain glucose homeostasis and prevent extreme fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Together, insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin play crucial roles in the intricate balance of glucose metabolism in the body. Gastrin, a hormone produced by the G cells in the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas, is released in response to food intake, particularly proteins, and stimulates the secretion of gastric acid from parietal cells. This gastric acid is crucial for activating digestive enzymes and aiding in the breakdown of food. The duodenum, the first section of the small intestine, produces the hormone secretin in response to the presence of acidic chyme from the stomach. Secretin stimulates the pancreas to release digestive enzymes and bicarbonate, which neutralises stomach acid and creates a more alkaline environment in the small intestine, optimising conditions for digestion. Additionally, when fats and partially digested proteins are present in the duodenum, it secretes another hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK promotes the release of bile from the gallbladder, which is essential for emulsifying fats and enhancing their digestion. CCK also stimulates the pancreas to release digestive enzymes that facilitate the breakdown of fats and proteins, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption. The ovaries produce a group of hormones known as oestrogens, which include oestradiol, oestrone, and oestriol. Additionally, oestrogens can be produced in smaller amounts by the testes and adrenal glands, as well as in adipose tissue, where androgens are converted into oestrogens through the action of the enzyme aromatase. These hormones regulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics in females, such as breast development, widening of the hips, enlargement of reproductive organs, softening of muscles, a higher pitch in the voice, and the development of broader pelvic bones to accommodate childbirth. Oestradiol, the most potent and prevalent form, plays a critical role in repairing the uterine lining after menstruation, preparing the body for potential pregnancy, and regulating the menstrual cycle. Oestrone, which is weaker, becomes the predominant oestrogen after menopause and is important for maintaining some of the body's oestrogen levels during this time. Oestrogens also maintain bone density by preventing excessive bone loss, influence body fat distribution by promoting a higher percentage of body fat in areas such as the hips and thighs, and contribute to the characteristic female physique. This fat distribution is believed to be protective against certain metabolic conditions and plays a role in fertility. Additionally, oestrogens influence metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity, contributing to the regulation of energy balance and overall body weight. The ovaries also secrete progesterone, which is produced primarily by the corpus luteum (a temporary gland that develops in the ovaries after ovulation). Additionally, progesterone can be produced in smaller amounts by the testes as a precursor to testosterone, as well as by the adrenal glands and the placenta during pregnancy. This hormone maintains the uterine lining during pregnancy, ensuring a suitable environment for a developing embryo. It is essential for supporting foetal development and preventing premature labour, playing a critical role in sustaining a healthy pregnancy. Progesterone also influences mood and can have a calming effect, contributing to emotional stability during the menstrual cycle and throughout pregnancy. In addition to its reproductive functions, progesterone plays a role in regulating the immune response, helping to protect the developing foetus by suppressing certain immune reactions that could compromise pregnancy. Post-menstrual pimples are primarily caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly elevated progesterone levels, which increase sebum production and inflammation, leading to clogged pores and acne formation. In males, the testes are responsible for producing androgens, which are hormones that govern male sexual characteristics. The principal androgen produced is testosterone, which plays a crucial role in the development of male secondary sexual characteristics, including a deepening voice, growth of facial and body hair, increased muscle mass and strength, widening of the chest, enlargement of reproductive organs, and stimulation of sperm production. Testosterone also influences libido, bone density, and the distribution of body fat, contributing to a lower percentage of body fat compared to females. Additionally, it plays a vital role in maintaining muscle and bone strength, supporting overall physical performance and health throughout life. Together, oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are essential for sexual differentiation, reproductive health, and the overall development of male and female characteristics, contributing to various aspects of physical and mental well-being, metabolic processes, mood regulation, and vitality throughout different life stages. Leptin is a hormone primarily produced by adipocytes, the cells in adipose tissue, with smaller amounts also secreted by the stomach, skeletal muscle, and placenta. It plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance by signalling the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure, indicating that the body has sufficient energy stores. Leptin levels are directly proportional to body fat stores, influencing sensations of fullness and energy expenditure to maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, in some cases, individuals may develop leptin resistance, where the brain becomes less responsive to the hormone's signals, leading to persistent hunger, difficulties in regulating appetite, and potential weight gain despite high leptin levels.

[Assignment 3] {Explore the causes and symptoms of common hormonal disorders/diseases (diabetes, goitre and osteoporosis) in humans}. Osmoregulation in humans involves maintaining a constant blood concentration by regulating the amount of water in the body. The water level is kept within limits according to the body's needs, balancing water gain and loss. Water is lost through urine, sweat, exhalation, and faeces, while it is gained through drinking, eating, and metabolic processes. Dehydration, caused by excessive water loss or insufficient water intake, can lead to symptoms such as dry skin, fatigue, dizziness, and impaired organ function. Conversely, overhydration, or water intoxication, occurs when excessive water intake dilutes blood electrolytes, potentially causing swelling of cells, confusion, nausea, and, in severe cases, seizures or coma. Changes in blood concentration due to water gain or loss are detected by specialised osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which monitors blood osmotic pressure. When blood becomes too concentrated, the hypothalamus signals the posterior pituitary gland to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is named for its primary function: anti-diuresis, which means the reduction of urine production. The term "diuretic" refers to substances that promote the excretion of urine, while "antidiuretic" indicates a substance that counters this effect. Therefore, ADH works to decrease the volume of urine produced by the kidneys, leading to increased water retention in the body. It increases the permeability of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys by facilitating the insertion of aquaporin channels into their membranes. These channels allow water to be reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate into the blood, resulting in concentrated, yellowish urine and reduced water loss. Conversely, when blood is too dilute, ADH production is inhibited, making the nephron walls less permeable to water. This leads to the production of large volumes of dilute, colourless urine to eliminate excess water. In addition to regulating kidney function, the hypothalamus stimulates the thirst centre when water levels are critically low, encouraging water intake to restore balance. Environmental conditions also influence water balance. In cold conditions, reduced sweating limits water loss, increasing urine output. In hot conditions, increased sweating lowers blood water levels, prompting more water reabsorption in the kidneys and producing concentrated, pale-yellow urine. Concentrated urine, when poured on plants, can cause water loss from plant cells, leading to wilting and drying. In addition to ADH, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) supports water regulation by promoting sodium and water reabsorption when blood volume or pressure drops. This complements ADH action to maintain both blood concentration and pressure. Persistent imbalances in water regulation, such as those caused by conditions like Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion (SIADH), can lead to issues like hyponatraemia (low sodium levels due to overhydration), resulting from excessive ADH secretion and fluid retention. Conversely, hypernatraemia (high sodium levels from dehydration) may occur when water levels are insufficient. Both conditions disrupt cellular function, emphasising the critical need for precise regulation of water balance. Water balance, therefore, reflects an intricate interplay of hormonal signals and environmental factors, ensuring the body maintains optimal hydration for health and physiological function. A deficiency in ADH or an impaired kidney response to ADH results in diabetes insipidus, characterised by excessive production of dilute urine, dehydration, and increased blood solute concentration. Video64.Osmoregulation.mp4. Homeostatic control of blood sugar in humans involves the precise regulation of glucose levels by the pancreas, particularly the islets of Langerhans. Glucose, the primary energy source for cells, must be maintained within optimal ranges to prevent energy deficits or osmotic imbalances in the blood. Blood glucose concentration is monitored by glucose receptor cells in the pancreas, which also contains endocrine cells—alpha (α), beta (β), and delta (δ) cells—that secrete glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin, respectively. These hormones work together to regulate blood sugar levels and maintain metabolic balance. After a carbohydrate-rich meal, glucose absorption into the hepatic portal vein raises blood glucose levels. This increase triggers the pancreas to release insulin from the β cells. Insulin facilitates glucose uptake by liver and muscle cells, where it is converted into glycogen for storage. Excess glucose may also be stored as fat in adipose tissue or broken down to produce energy in the form of ATP. Additionally, insulin promotes protein synthesis and inhibits the breakdown of fats (lipolysis) and proteins, conserving energy stores. These actions lower blood glucose levels to normal, at which point insulin secretion ceases. When blood glucose levels drop, such as during fasting or prolonged starvation, the pancreas releases glucagon from the α cells. Glucagon stimulates liver cells to convert stored glycogen back into glucose, promotes gluconeogenesis (the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and fats), and enhances lipolysis in adipose tissue, providing alternative energy sources. It also slows the rate of glucose oxidation in cells, prioritising glucose availability for vital organs like the brain. These processes restore blood glucose to normal levels, and glucagon secretion ceases. Somatostatin, secreted by the δ cells, plays a regulatory role by inhibiting the release of both insulin and glucagon, preventing excessive secretion of either hormone. This balancing mechanism helps avoid dramatic fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Somatostatin also slows nutrient absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, further contributing to glucose stability and ensuring a steady supply of energy. Failure to produce sufficient insulin or reduced sensitivity to it results in elevated blood glucose levels, as glucose cannot efficiently enter cells for energy. This condition, known as diabetes mellitus, is characterised by high blood sugar, frequent urination (polyuria), and increased thirst (polydipsia). There are two main types of diabetes mellitus: type 1 diabetes, where the body fails to produce insulin due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells, and type 2 diabetes, which is characterised by insulin resistance, where cells do not respond effectively to insulin, often associated with obesity and lifestyle factors. Treatment for type 1 diabetes typically involves lifelong insulin therapy, along with blood glucose monitoring and dietary management. In contrast, type 2 diabetes may be managed through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, oral medications that improve insulin sensitivity or secretion, and in some cases, insulin therapy may also be required. Prolonged high blood sugar can lead to complications such as nerve damage, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. When blood glucose exceeds the renal threshold, excess glucose is excreted in urine. Hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, is a condition that can occur in both individuals with diabetes and those without. In people with diabetes, particularly those on insulin or certain oral medications, hypoglycaemia can result from an imbalance between insulin levels and food intake. There are several other forms of diabetes beyond the main types. Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are elevated but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis, serving as a warning sign for potential progression to type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy when hormonal changes lead to insulin resistance, increasing blood sugar levels. While it typically resolves after childbirth, it raises the risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. Other rare forms include monogenic diabetes, caused by genetic mutations, and secondary diabetes, which results from underlying medical conditions or treatments, such as pancreatitis or steroid use. Effective management of blood sugar levels is crucial for individuals with diabetes, ensuring proper metabolic function and preventing episodes of hypoglycaemia, which can cause confusion, irritability, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness. The complementary actions of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin demonstrate the pancreas's vital role in maintaining blood sugar homeostasis. Dysregulation of these hormones can have widespread effects, emphasising the importance of their balance in sustaining metabolic health. Note: Although diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus share symptoms like frequent urination (polyuria) and intense thirst (polydipsia), they arise from distinct mechanisms. Diabetes mellitus involves insulin deficiency or resistance, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels. In contrast, diabetes insipidus results from inadequate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or kidney insensitivity to ADH, without affecting blood glucose levels. Video65.diabetes.mp4. Control of growth and metabolic activity in humans involves a delicate balance of hormones, with the thyroid gland playing a central role. The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and energy utilisation. These hormones—thyroxine (T₄) and triiodothyronine (T₃)—are essential for normal physical and mental development, as well as the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. The production of these hormones depends on iodine, a critical dietary component. The hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland regulate thyroid hormone levels through a feedback mechanism involving thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the pituitary gland, ensuring the body’s metabolic needs are met. Goitre is the enlargement of the thyroid gland, often caused by hormonal imbalances. The most common cause worldwide is iodine deficiency, as iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. When iodine intake is insufficient, the thyroid enlarges in an attempt to produce more hormones. Autoimmune diseases like Graves' disease (causing hyperthyroidism) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (causing hypothyroidism) can also result in goitre. In these conditions, immune system dysfunction either overstimulates or impairs the thyroid, disrupting hormone levels. Additionally, thyroid nodules (non-cancerous lumps) and hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to thyroid enlargement. Symptoms of goitre include visible swelling in the neck, difficulty swallowing or breathing, and signs of thyroid imbalance such as weight changes, fatigue, and altered heart rate. Effective management of goitre depends on addressing its underlying cause, which may involve iodine supplementation, hormone therapy, or treatment of autoimmune conditions. The thyroid's vital role in growth and metabolism underscores the importance of maintaining its health and function. Video66.thyroid_problems.mp4. Bone health is crucial for overall well-being and mobility, serving as the body's structural framework and playing a vital role in mineral storage and blood cell production. This dynamic tissue is maintained by the coordinated activity of three primary bone cell types: osteoblasts, which are responsible for forming new bone; osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue to regulate bone resorption and calcium release; and osteocytes, which are mature bone cells that maintain bone strength and communicate signals for repair. However, various factors, including hormonal imbalances and lifestyle choices, can significantly impact bone density and strength. Osteoporosis, a condition characterised by weakened bones, is a leading concern, particularly as individuals age. There are two primary types of osteoporosis: primary osteoporosis, which occurs naturally with ageing, and secondary osteoporosis, which results from underlying medical conditions or medications. Primary osteoporosis is subdivided into type 1 (postmenopausal osteoporosis), driven by a sharp decline in oestrogen levels in women after menopause, and type 2 (senile osteoporosis), which generally affects both sexes after the age of 70 due to age-related changes in bone remodelling and reduced calcium absorption. Secondary osteoporosis can arise from conditions like hyperparathyroidism, which causes excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, accelerating bone resorption and weakening the skeletal structure. Additional risk factors include insufficient calcium and vitamin D intake, sedentary lifestyles, and prolonged use of medications like steroids, which disrupt bone metabolism. Osteoporosis often develops silently, with symptoms such as fractures from minor injuries, back pain, loss of height, and a stooped posture emerging as the condition progresses. Early detection through bone density scans and interventions—such as dietary changes, weight-bearing exercises, and medications—are crucial for preserving bone health and reducing fracture risk. Hormonal balance and proactive lifestyle choices are pivotal for maintaining a strong skeletal framework. Video67.osteoporosis.mp4. • In groups, discuss and produce a chart showing the causes and symptoms of diabetes, goitre, and osteoporosis. [Assignment 4] {Explore the role of diet in managing hormonal disorders/diseases in humans}. Diet plays a crucial role in managing hormonal disorders and diseases in humans by providing essential nutrients that support hormone production, regulation, and overall endocrine health. A balanced diet rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins, optimises hormonal function. For instance, omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, reduce inflammation and promote the balance of hormones such as insulin and cortisol. Foods high in fibre, such as legumes and whole grains, regulate blood sugar levels and enhance insulin sensitivity, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with conditions like diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Micronutrients also play a vital role in hormonal health and overall metabolic balance. For instance, vitamin D is essential for calcium metabolism and regulates parathyroid hormone, ensuring balanced calcium levels and supporting bone health. Vitamin B₁₂ is equally important, as it is necessary for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production, contributing to energy levels and the optimal functioning of the nervous system, which interacts with the endocrine system to regulate hormone secretion. Zinc is critical for testosterone production and immune function, thereby supporting reproductive health and the body's ability to fend off illness. Additionally, magnesium, another key micronutrient, is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including the regulation of blood sugar levels and support for adrenal health, making it particularly important for managing stress-related hormonal imbalances. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet impacts hormonal health directly, as obesity is associated with insulin resistance and altered levels of sex hormones. Cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli and kale, contain compounds that assist in metabolising excess oestrogen, making them advantageous for individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions.
