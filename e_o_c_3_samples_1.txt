Item 2 [UNEB Sample]: Peter is in the process of constructing his house without affecting the environment. He wants to build a good strong house; there are various building materials of different quality and properties on the market. However, he does not know the quality of materials to use. Peter knows that choosing quality materials depends on the nature of the material and has come to you for advice. Task: Use your chemistry knowledge to;#(a) Explain (i) Categories of materials.#(Substance and material with a reason).#A material is a substance or a mixture of substances that constitute an object. It can be Natural or Artificial. Natural material is God made/exists in nature and its formation is not influenced by man e.g., rocks, sand, wood, water, soil etc. Artificial material is man-made/synthetic, manufactured by man e.g., iron bars, plastics, paint, composites (03 scores).#(ii) The suitability of the materials.#Materials to be used for constructing a good strong house have different qualities based on their nature. A house is made up of the following:#(a) Iron;#- Very strong (can support heavy load).#- has high tensile strength (resists breakage).#- its ductile and malleable (easy to mould).#- has high melting point (resists fires).#- Galvanised iron resists rusting.#- steel has improved properties, making it suitable for many users.#(b) Aluminium;#- low density (used on top of buildings).#- strong, not easy to break/durable.#- has high melting points (resists fires).#- has bright appearance (used for doors, roofing, window frames).#- high electrical/heat conductivity (making utensils).#(c) Wood;#- Readily available so easy to get cheaply.#- Strong, so it can support heavy load.#- Light when dry so good for roofing.#- Easy to smoothen to give nice appearance.#- can rot or be eaten by termites when not treated.#(d) Mortar; Composite made of cement, sand and water;#- Hard so resists deformation.#-It is adhesive so can join bricks.#-Cushioning to spread the vertical load.#(e) Glass;#- Ordinary glass is transparent so good for windows to see through.#- tinted glass allows light to pass through it in only one direction so good for windows (visual security).#- Double-glazed glass (tampered glass) is strong, resistant to fire attack and it is not brittle.#- Glass is reflective, attractive and it adds value when put in doors and windows.#(f) Paint; This is a liquid composite made of pigment, resin, solvent and additives.#- Weather guard resists bad weather (water proof). So good for outside walls.#- Silk vinyl paint does not burn, so good for interior purposes.#- Paint can be insect repelling, light sensitive to beautify, protect walls.#(g) Plastics;#- These are man-made polymers which can undergo permanent deformation without breaking when subjected to a strong force. E.g. PVC, Polyethene, Nylon, Polyesters.#- They are flexible so can be bent easily.#- They are water prone so are good for Plumbing and roofing.#- They are light and strong, so good for shuttering purposes.#- They have low melting points so can be attacked by fires easily.#(h) Clay and Ceramics;#- They are brittle so break easily.#- They are water proof so good for flooring.#- They are good looking, so nice for Finishing purpose like floors, walls.#- They cannot be attacked by chemicals.#(i) Bricks and blocks:#- Resistant to fire so good for wall construction.#- They are strong, so can support heavy loads (03 scores).#(b) Advise peter on the choice of materials.#The choice of material for construction is dependent on the purpose it is meant to do and its impact to the environment.#(a) Iron;#- Making shutters for doors, windows.#- Making frames for doors windows.#- Reinforcing concrete.#- Irons used to fix/join objects like timber, iron sheets.#- Used for plumbing.#(b) Aluminium;#- Making shutters for doors, and windows.#- Making frames for doors and windows.#- Reinforcing concrete.#- Making roofing materials (struts and ties).#- electrical installations, wires.#(c) Wood;#- Used to make shutters for windows, doors.#- Making frames for doors, windows.#- Making struts and ties during roofing.#- Making poles, pillars and beams.#(d) Mortar;#- Joining and binding bricks.#- Making concrete for floors.#- Plastering walls.#(e) Glass;#- Making shutters for doors, windows.#(f) Paint;#- Beautifying (better appearance) of buildings.#- Protecting materials, from rusting.#- Enhancing durability.#(f) Plastics;#- Making pipes (water pipes) for plumbing.#- Making door and window stutters.#(h) Clay and Ceramics;#- Making bricks.#- Making Tiles (floor tiles).#- Making roofing tiles.#(i) Bricks and blocks;#- Constructing walls (03 scores).#Material used in construction of a house can have an impact to the environment.#(a) Iron;#- Depletes soil fertility when it accumulates.#- Being a heavy metal can cause cancer.#- Non biodegradable.#(b) Aluminium;#- Depletes soil fertility when it accumulates.#(c) Plastics;#- Non biodegradable, spoils the soil.#(d) Mortar;#- Bulky, takes long to decompose and so spoils the soil (02 scores).

Item 2 [Tr. Kajubi Charles]: Mr. John an investor in your village wants to construct a storied (flat) business house in the trading centre, the contracted engineer has asked you to help him while choosing the materials he is to use to construct Mr. John’s building. Task: As a student of chemistry;#(a) help the engineer to choose five materials that should not miss on his list.#(b) why do you think the materials in (a) should not miss on his list?#(c) Advise the engineer on the choice of the materials#Solution#(a) Essential Materials:#Concrete, for the foundation, floors, and structural support.#Steel, for reinforcement in concrete and structural framework.#Bricks or Blocks, for walls and partitions.#Glass, for windows and potential façade elements.#Wood, for doors, frames, and interior finishing.#(b) Reasons why the above materials should not miss on the list#Concrete, is strong in compression, making it ideal for supporting the weight of the building. It's also fire-resistant and has good thermal mass.#Steel, has high tensile strength, which is necessary for withstanding forces like tension and shear. It also adds ductility to the structure, allowing it to flex under heavy loads.#Bricks or Blocks, provide good insulation, are durable, and have a high loadbearing capacity, which is crucial for the walls of a multi-storied building. Glass, allows natural light to enter, reducing lighting costs, and can be treated for energy efficiency and aesthetics.#Wood, offers a combination of strength and aesthetics for non-structural elements and can be easily worked with for custom designs.#(c) Advice#(Choice of the material depends on many factors but in this case, you shall focus on the use and sustainability of the material (environmental friendliness))

Item 2 [Tr. Kajubi Charles]: While investigating the reaction of period 3 elements with water, Juma first considered two elements A and B and the results of their reactions with water is summarized as below.#Element A Reacted violently while floating on surface of cold water forming an alkaline solution with evolution of hydrogen gas#Element B Reacted slowly with cold water forming an alkaline solution and hydrogen gas but when heated with steam formed a white solid and hydrogen gas. Task: As a chemistry learner:#(a) Give the category of elements A and B#(b) Predict the reaction of other elements in period 3 with water#(c) Advise Juma about the dangers associated with the reaction of these elements with water.#Solution#(a) Category of elements A and B#Element A is an alkali metal, because it reacts violently with water, floats on the surface, forms an alkaline solution, and evolves hydrogen gas. This behaviour is characteristic of alkali metals like sodium (Na) or potassium (K).#Element B is an alkaline earth metal, because it reacts slowly with water to form an alkaline solution and hydrogen gas, and when heated with steam, it forms a white solid.#This is typical of alkaline earth metals like magnesium (Mg) or calcium (Ca), which form oxides or hydroxides.#(b) Reaction of other elements in period 3 with water#Elements in period 3 of the periodic table include; Sodium (Na), Magnesium (Mg), Aluminium (Al), Silicon (Si), Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), Chlorine (Cl), and Argon (Ar).#Sodium (Na) would react similarly to Element A, violently with water forming an alkaline solution with evolution of hydrogen gas.#2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)#Magnesium (Mg) would react similarly to Element B, slowly with water and more vigorously with steam.#With cold water: Mg(s) + 2H2O(l) → Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)#With steam: Mg(s) + H2O(l) → MgO(s) + H2(g)#Aluminium (Al) reacts with water only when it is finely powdered at high temperatures, forming aluminium oxide and hydrogen gas.#2Al(s) + 3H2O(l) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)#Phosphorus (P) and Sulphur (S) do not react with water.#Chlorine (Cl) does not react with water, but chlorine dissolves is water forming (chlorine water) a mixture of hypochlorous (chloric acid) acid and hydrochloric acid#Cl2(g) + H2O(l) → HOCl(aq) + HCl(aq)#Silicon does not react with water under normal conditions but reacts with steam to form silicon (IV) oxide and hydrogen#Si(s) + H2O(l) → SiO2(s) + H2(g)#Argon (Ar) is a noble gas and does not react with water.#(c) Advising Juma about the dangers associated with these reactions:#Juma should be aware that reactions of metals with water can be highly exothermic, meaning they release a significant amount of heat so they can be explosive#The evolution of hydrogen gas can be dangerous as it is highly flammable and can lead to explosions if ignited.#Juma should conduct these experiments in a well-ventilated area and use proper safety equipment, such as gloves and goggles, to protect from splashes and the heat generated during the reactions.#It's also important to have a fire extinguisher nearby and to work under the supervision of a knowledgeable instructor.
