Theme ***Mining and manufacturing in East Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 13 ***DEVELOPMENT OF MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IN EAST AFRICA*** "14 PERIODS". Competency; The learner understands the advantages of developing manufacturing industries, the types and locations of manufacturing industries and the problems of developing manufacturing industries. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand what manufacturing industries are (u); b) know some types of manufacturing industries in East Africa and their locations (k); c) use field work to study a local factory and its effects on the environment (s); d) understand the factors influencing the distribution and development of any three manufacturing industries (u); e) appreciate the contribution of manufacturing industries in transforming primary products (v, a, gs); f) appreciate the importance of developing industries to process raw materials exported from East Africa (v, a, gs); g) understand the effects of manufacturing industries on the environment (u). Types of manufacturing industries • What are manufacturing industries? • give examples of manufacturing industries in your local area and other areas of Uganda, and suggest where the products of these industries are sold • Working in pairs, explain three types of manufacturing industries: those making goods for sale in shops (consumer goods); those making goods for sale to other industries (industrial/ producer goods); those processing agricultural raw materials or minerals (processing industries). • Feedback to whole-class discussion. • Working in groups, give examples of each type of industry in Uganda or East Africa and their locations. investigate where manufacturing industries are located in Uganda and in East Africa and create maps to show their distribution. • Present your maps to the class. • Where possible, visit a manufacturing or processing industry and find out what it produces, raw materials, use of labour, capital and ownership. Factors that influence the development of manufacturing industries • Working in small groups: • list things which are needed to develop a manufacturing industry, thinking of specific examples you know. • use a range of sources on Internet to research manufacturing industry and apply the information to East Africa. • make notes on the factors necessary for the development of industries. • draw a flow diagram to show the processes of industrial development from raw materials to marketing industrial products (s). • Present your flow diagrams to the class. Any points not entirely clear on the diagrams should be clarified. • Think of one or two industries in Uganda and write how each of the above factors favouring the development of industries is important in the development of that industry. • work in groups to examine the advantages and problems of developing manufacturing industries and make recommendations as ‘experts’ to guide the development of industries in Uganda. Processing industries • Explain that many industries in East Africa are established to process raw materials before they are sold for export. • give four examples of processing industries: two for agricultural raw materials and two for minerals. • suggest the advantages of exporting processed or manufactured goods rather than raw materials. • Through questioning, explore the idea of adding value to a product. • suggest some agricultural products to which farmers can add value. Industrial / producer goods • Suggest the kinds of materials that are usually imported from overseas when we are constructing things like roads, railways, dams or buildings. • explain why it is good to develop manufacturing industries for industrial/ producer goods for use by other industries • Expand your ideas using the example of cement in Uganda. • What would be your recommendations, if you were a Minister in charge of Industrial development. What laws would you make to ensure that the development of manufacturing industries benefits the people of the local area? discuss your suggestions in pairs, and then present your ideas to the class. Consumer goods • Give examples of goods made in Uganda for sale in the local shops. • Give examples of goods that we buy from overseas but could be made in Uganda. • explain the advantages of the “Buy Uganda Build Uganda” (BUBU) policy. Challenges to and Problems of developing manufacturing industries • discuss the challenges to developing manufacturing industries in East Africa (e.g., capital, power supplies, transport, skilled labour, political instability etc.,). • discuss or debate whether we should continue to import second-hand clothes and shoes from overseas. Suggest the advantages and disadvantages of this? • What do you know about the wages paid to people working in factories: are they adequate for the workers to meet their needs? • Explain the problems that arise from overseas companies, or local companies, paying very low wages to the workers. discuss whether there should be a minimum wage. • What are the kind of places where most people who work in manufacturing industries live. Do they live in good conditions? Why do people from rural areas come to work in manufacturing industries? • Explain the problems of rural-urban drift and the creation of slums. • Do you know any manufacturing industry? Does it produce waste or pollution? If so, what kind and where does it go? • Discuss the problems of waste and pollution from factories. Which particular kinds of places are polluted? • Discuss the dangers of pollution of lakes and wet lands, especially Lake Victoria. • debate an imagined scenario in which a new cement factory is to be built, some arguing in favour of and others against the industry. How well do you understand the processes involved and the pros and cons for workers and the environment? Case study of manufacturing industry • Choose a manufacturing industry you are familiar with and develop a case study of the industry mentioning all the ideas learnt so far. • Work in small groups to look up one of the Uganda cement industries on the internet. Select and explore another industry in order to further debate on the challenges of developing manufacturing industries in East Africa. Focus on how informed the arguments of your classmates are.
