Theme ***Light*** "@OMD". TOPIC 2 ***REFRACTION, DISPERSION, AND COLOUR*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to understand the phenomenon of refraction and its effects. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand that light may be refracted as it passes from one medium to another and that this has both consequences and uses (u, s, v/a); b) understand the concept of refractive index (u, s); c) understand the concept of total internal reflection(u); d) know that white light can be split into coloured light by refraction (k, s); e) know that white light results from the superimposition of light of all colours of the visible spectrum (u, k); f) determine refractive index of glass (s, gs). • In groups: • investigate and explain with diagrams, how a ray of light is refracted as it passes between two adjacent media • explain phenomena such as the apparent bending of a stick in water and determine refractive index of glass. • In groups, use light boxes and glass prisms to: • investigate and report on total internal reflection and critical angle • explain on a poster how prisms can be used instead of plane mirrors in periscopes • In groups: • investigate and report on the causes of light dispersion and how a prism splits white light into coloured light by refraction • explain dispersion of light, such as oil on water and rainbows. • In groups, use light filters to investigate and report on why coloured objects appear coloured. • In pairs, research and report on how a whole range of different colours is shown on a television screen, although each point on the screen receives only red, green, and blue light. Note: a) Numerical problems involving real and apparent depth should not be included; b) Variety of experiments involving glass block are recommended.
