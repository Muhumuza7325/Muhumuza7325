Qn. In Nakasongola, people make charcoal from burning wood. Jimmy has just migrated to Nakasongola and wants to make charcoal from wood like the rest of his neighbours. He piled pieces of wood, introduced fire underneath and left them to burn overnight. In the morning, he found a hip of ash with very little pieces of charcoal, not strong enough likewhat his neighbours make. As a friend to Jimmy who understands the process of charcoal making, write a letter to advise him on how to make charcoal. (10 Scores);
