[Assignment 1] {Explore the need for differentiation of cells as multicellular plants and animals grow}. The differentiation of cells is a fundamental process in the growth and development of multicellular organisms. It is the mechanism by which unspecialised or less specialised cells, typically stem cells, become specialised to perform specific functions within the organism. This process is critical for the proper organisation, functioning, and adaptation of multicellular organisms. In both plants and animals, differentiation begins with stem cells that are undifferentiated and capable of becoming any cell type (totipotent stem cells). In animals, these stem cells are typically found in specific tissues (e.g., bone marrow, brain, etc.), while in plants, stem cells are found in regions such as the apical meristems and cambium. On the other hand, multipotent and pluripotent stem cells have more limited differentiation potential. Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into almost any type of cell (e.g., embryonic stem cells), while multipotent stem cells are limited to certain cell types (e.g., adult stem cells). In some species, stem cells are capable of regenerating entire tissues or organs (e.g., in amphibians like salamanders). In humans, stem cells are used in regenerative medicine (to repair or replace damaged tissues) and offer much more — including the possibility of an individual having a baby with themselves by generating both sperm and egg cells from their own stem cells, a concept still in experimental stages. In multicellular organisms, differentiation is essential because a single cell (the fertilised egg or zygote) must divide and form a multitude of different cell types, tissues, and organs that work together to sustain the organism. In animals, the zygote undergoes cleavage and forms a blastocyst, which contains pluripotent stem cells. These cells begin to differentiate into the three primary germ layers—ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm—which will give rise to all the tissues and organs in the body. In plants, after fertilisation, a single fertilised egg (zygote) divides and forms a structure called the embryo within the seed. Cells in the embryo differentiate to form the primary tissues of the plant, such as the dermal tissue, vascular tissue, and ground tissue, which will later give rise to the mature plant. Genes play a fundamental role in regulating cellular differentiation by controlling the expression of specific proteins that guide a cell's development into a specialised type, determining its structure and function. This regulation ensures that cells activate or suppress particular pathways as required during development. Environmental factors also influence cell differentiation. For example, in plants, light, water, and gravity can direct growth and cell differentiation, while in animals, hormones, growth factors, and extracellular signals interact with genetic pathways to regulate differentiation, supporting proper development and adaptation to environmental changes. Multicellularity and differentiation significantly enhance an organism's efficiency in performing complex processes, such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, which single-celled organisms cannot achieve. In animals, this efficiency is evident as muscle cells specialise in contraction to enable movement, nerve cells (neurons) transmit electrical signals to coordinate bodily functions, and epithelial cells form protective barriers like the skin and mucous membranes. Organ formation exemplifies this further; for instance, the heart comprises muscle cells that pump blood, the liver contains cells that metabolise toxins, produce bile, and store nutrients, while the pancreas consists of cells that produce digestive enzymes and insulin. In the immune system, stem cells in the bone marrow differentiate into various blood cells, including white blood cells that defend against infections. Similarly, in plants, xylem cells transport water and minerals from roots to leaves, phloem cells distribute sugars and nutrients throughout the plant, and guard cells regulate gas exchange by controlling the opening and closing of stomata. Differentiation also leads to specialised structures such as leaves for photosynthesis, flowers for reproduction, and roots for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Differentiation allows plants and animals to adapt to their environments by forming specialised structures. For instance, certain plant cells differentiate into trichomes to defend against herbivores or to prevent water loss, while animals develop specialised sensory organs to detect environmental changes. In plants, differentiation also supports growth at specific sites, particularly in the roots and shoots, through the activity of apical meristems. Cells in these meristems differentiate into specialised cells that contribute to the formation of new tissues, facilitating vertical growth. Additionally, cambium cells differentiate to produce secondary tissues such as xylem and phloem, enabling secondary growth and increasing the plant's thickness. For more specialised cells, refer to topic 1.2, cells. Video100.Specialised_cells.mp4. Video101.How_cells_become_specialised.mp4. • In groups, discuss the need for cells to become specialised as animals and plants grow, considering the different types of cells in your own bodies and in plants you can see in the locality. Share conclusions in whole class discussion and agree on a definition of cell differentiation. [Assignment 2] {Explore the process of secondary growth of stems in dicotyledonous plants}. Secondary growth in dicotyledonous plants, such as trees and shrubs, is the increase in the thickness (diameter) of the plant's stems and roots, after the initial growth in length. This process occurs in plants with a vascular cambium, a layer of actively dividing undifferentiated meristematic cells, that produces new vascular tissues (xylem and phloem). Before secondary growth of stems can occur, the plant undergoes primary growth, where the apical meristem (located at the tip of the stem) divides to produce new cells that elongate, increasing the plant’s length. In dicotyledonous plants, primary growth forms the basic vascular system with xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside of the vascular bundles. Following the primary growth stage, the vascular cambium, a lateral meristem, develops from undifferentiated cells located between the primary xylem and primary phloem, differentiating into two types of meristematic cells: the fascicular cambium, derived from vascular bundles between the xylem and phloem, and the interfascicular cambium, originating from parenchyma cells between vascular bundles. These cambium cells divide to produce new vascular tissues in specific directions: secondary xylem (wood) towards the inside, thickening the stem, and secondary phloem towards the outside, contributing to the bark. The thickening of xylem provides structural support for the plant and contributes to efficient transport of water and minerals, essential for the plant’s survival as it grows. Older xylem tissues also serve as a storage site for water and nutrients, supporting the plant during adverse conditions. In some dicots, secondary growth can occur concentrically, where the cambium produces uniform layers of wood and bark. In most dicots, the vascular cambium is bifacial, meaning it produces secondary xylem on the inner side and secondary phloem on the outer side, leading to distinct layers of wood and bark. In temperate climates, the vascular cambium produces cells that vary in size depending on environmental conditions. In the spring, the cambium produces larger xylem cells (early wood), and in the summer, it produces smaller, denser cells (late wood). These rings form annually and are used to estimate the age of trees. Medullary rays, produced by the vascular cambium as bands of parenchyma cells extending radially from the centre of the stem, facilitate the transport of nutrients and water across the stem. As the plant grows, the outer tissues (epidermis and phloem) can be stretched and damaged. To protect the plant, a second lateral meristem called the cork cambium (or phellogen) forms outside the phloem. The cork cambium produces cork cells (phellem) on its outer side and phelloderm, a thin layer of parenchyma cells, on its inner side. Together, the phellem, phelloderm, and the cork cambium itself comprise the protective outer layer known as the periderm. Over time, older phloem layers become crushed and non-functional, while new layers continue to form beneath the cork. The combination of the production of secondary xylem and phloem, along with the formation of the periderm, results in the increase in stem diameter. Figure287.3.9.development_in_plants_and_animals_image_001.jpg. This secondary growth allows the plant to support larger structures, such as branches, leaves, and flowers. The cork cells are dead at maturity and provide protection against water loss, pathogens, and mechanical injury. Thus, secondary growth in dicotyledonous plants is a vital process that enables the stem to increase in diameter through the activity of the vascular and cork cambium. This growth is key to the development of woody structures and ensures the plant’s ability to support larger organs, transport water and nutrients efficiently, and protect itself from external factors. Understanding secondary growth is fundamental in fields like botany, forestry, and plant biology, as it explains the growth patterns and longevity of many plants, particularly trees. As the plant continues to thicken, older parts of the stem may become lignified, providing the necessary rigidity to support its structure. During maturation, the innermost layers of the secondary xylem transition to heartwood (typically dark brown or reddish-brown). This transition occurs as the cells in these layers fill with resin and other compounds, leading to their death and loss of function in water transport. Heartwood contributes additional structural support and durability to the plant. In contrast, the outer layers of xylem, known as sapwood (usually light-coloured or pale), remain active in transporting water and nutrients. However, secondary growth in plants can have disadvantages. It increases the plant's resource demands for water and nutrients, which may be unsustainable in poor soils or drought conditions. The dense wood can also make plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Additionally, extensive secondary growth can limit light penetration to the understory, reducing biodiversity and hindering the growth of smaller plants. Furthermore, large trees with shallow roots may contribute to soil erosion during storms or heavy rains. Video102.Mechanisms_of_plant_growth.mp4. • In pairs, research on secondary growth in dicot stems. Share understanding with larger group and record agreed conclusions in annotated diagrams or notes. [Assignment 3] {Explain the meaning of the term metamorphosis, and compare complete and incomplete metamorphosis}. The term metamorphosis originates from the Greek words meta (meaning "change") and morphe (meaning "form" or "shape") and refers to the transformation of an organism’s body form, structure and function, as it progresses from one developmental stage to another, often involving drastic changes. This process is an adaptation that allows specific organisms, particularly insects and amphibians, to transition between distinct life stages, each suited to a particular ecological role. Metamorphosis is broadly classified into two types: complete and incomplete metamorphosis, with differences and similarities evident in the stages and organisms involved. These two processes differ in the number of developmental stages and the extent of physical change an organism undergoes. In complete metamorphosis, an organism passes through four distinct stages: egg (eggs), larva (larvae), pupa (pupae), and adult (adults). Each stage of development is distinctly different in form and function. For example, a butterfly starts as an egg, which hatches into a larva (caterpillar)—a worm-like stage specialised for feeding and growth. This larval stage then undergoes a transformation into a pupa (chrysalis), encased in a protective casing or cocoon. During this resting or inactive phase, extensive internal reorganisation takes place. Finally, the organism emerges as an adult butterfly (imago), which is adapted for reproduction and dispersal. Other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis include mosquitoes, houseflies, tsetse flies, bees, wasps, moths and beetles. This process allows for resource partitioning, as immature and mature forms often inhabit different niches and avoid competition. In contrast, incomplete metamorphosis consists of three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The nymph resembles a smaller, immature version of the adult but lacks certain features such as wings and functional reproductive organs. As the organism grows, it undergoes a series of moults (ecdysis), involving the shedding of the exoskeleton. With each moult, the organism gradually becomes more adult-like, and after the final moult, the nymph matures into the adult form, characterised by fully developed wings (if applicable) and reproductive organs. Grasshoppers, crickets, locusts, bedbugs, cockroaches, dragon flies and termites are common examples. Unlike complete metamorphosis, this gradual development ensures that the nymph and adult often share similar habitats and diets, leading to competition between life stages. The key differences between complete and incomplete metamorphosis lie in the number and nature of developmental stages. Complete metamorphosis involves a distinct pupal stage where dramatic reorganisation occurs, while incomplete metamorphosis involves gradual changes without a pupal stage. Despite these differences, both processes aim to ensure survival and reproduction in changing environmental conditions by allowing organisms to adapt to varying ecological roles throughout their life cycle. Amphibians, such as frogs and toads, also undergo metamorphosis, which can be considered analogous to complete metamorphosis in insects. Frogs start their life cycle as eggs laid in water, which hatch into aquatic larvae (tadpoles). Tadpoles are equipped with gills for breathing, tails for swimming, and an herbivorous diet. During metamorphosis, they undergo drastic changes, including the development of lungs, legs, and a carnivorous diet, alongside the loss of gills and tail, eventually transforming into terrestrial adults. Although amphibians do not have a distinct pupal stage like insects, the transformation from tadpole to adult can be seen as analogous to a pupal phase, as it involves significant physiological changes that prepare the organism for life on land. Salamanders also experience metamorphosis, though some species exhibit incomplete metamorphosis by retaining larval traits such as gills into adulthood, a phenomenon called neoteny. In contrast, many vertebrates such as mammals, birds, and reptiles do not undergo metamorphosis. These organisms are born or hatch with body structures already suited to their environment, requiring only gradual growth to maturity. The absence of metamorphosis reflects their stable ecological roles and the lack of evolutionary pressure for drastic developmental changes. Thus, metamorphosis is an evolutionary strategy that enhances survival and reproductive success in organisms needing different forms and functions at various life stages. Video103.Metamorphosis.mp4. • Observe video clips of complete and incomplete metamorphosis, or research using different sources. In pairs, produce a table comparing the two types. [Assignment 4] {Explain the stages of development in an insect}. Insect development begins when the adult lays eggs, which can be fertilised either internally, where mating occurs before laying (the most common method among insects), or externally, where sperm is deposited onto the eggs as they are laid. Some eggs may remain unfertilised and develop parthenogenetically, allowing offspring to arise without fertilisation. The eggs typically consist of a protective outer shell or chorion, which prevents desiccation and provides defence against predators. Beneath the shell, the egg contains a nutrient-rich yolk that supplies the necessary energy for the developing embryo. After a period of development, depending on the species and environmental factors, the egg hatches. Upon hatching, the insect enters the next stage of its life cycle, such as a larva or nymph, depending on whether it undergoes complete or incomplete metamorphosis. Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis are called holometabolous insects (from Greek holos, meaning "whole," and metabole, meaning "change"), whereas those that undergo incomplete metamorphosis are known as hemimetabolous insects (from Greek hemi, meaning "partial"). The larva often appears quite different from the adult insect, typically resembling a worm, with a simple body structure that lacks wings and reproductive organs. Its primary focus is on feeding, growing, and storing energy, all of which prepare it for the subsequent stages of its life cycle. For instance, caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths, feed on leaves, while maggots, the larvae of house flies, consume decaying organic matter. After the larva reaches a certain size and has accumulated enough energy, it enters the pupal stage. This is a resting or inactive phase during which the insect undergoes dramatic internal changes. The larva forms a protective casing (cocoon), and inside this casing, it transforms into an adult. The pupal stage is a critical period in the life cycle, as it allows the insect to reorganise its body structure, such as developing wings and reproductive organs. The pupa of a butterfly is called a chrysalis. On the other hand, the nymph is a miniature version of the adult. Nymphs resemble adults but are typically smaller, lack wings, and may have underdeveloped reproductive organs. The nymph will moult several times, shedding its exoskeleton as it grows. The number of moults varies depending on the species, and with each moult, the nymph becomes more adult-like, eventually developing wings in some species. After completing the pupal stage or after the final moult of the nymph, the adult insect (also called the imago) emerges. The adult is fully developed, with wings (if applicable), and reproductive organs. It is capable of reproduction and will eventually lay eggs to start the life cycle again. However, a remarkable reproductive strategy, known as telescoping generations, is observed in certain insect species, particularly aphids. In this process, a female aphid can give birth to live young that are already pregnant with their own offspring. This rapid reproductive strategy allows for rapid population growth, especially in favourable conditions. It's as if multiple generations are "telescoped" into a single individual, hence the name. This adaptation has enabled aphids to become significant agricultural pests, as their populations can explode in a short period. • Individually, produce drawings to show stages of each type of metamorphosis in insects. [Assignment 5] {Explore the lifecycles of a housefly, cockroach, mosquito, bee, and butterfly}. The life cycle of a housefly (Musca domestica) is completed in approximately 7–10 days under favourable conditions, such as warm temperatures and abundant food. Houseflies undergo complete metamorphosis. After mating, a female housefly, with a life span of 15–30 days, can lay up to 500 eggs in her lifetime, typically in batches of 75–150 eggs. The eggs are laid on warm, moist, decaying organic matter such as garbage, meat, or faeces, which provide ideal conditions for development. Within 8–24 hours, the eggs hatch into larvae, commonly known as maggots. These cream-coloured, conical-shaped larvae lack legs and have a small, inconspicuous head equipped with hook-like mouthparts used for feeding and movement through decaying matter. Spiracles on the second and last segments enable breathing, while their light sensitivity ensures they remain in dark, warm, and moist environments. After 3-5 days and moulting (shading its cuticle) twice, the larva is about 1cm long. It then moves to drier areas of the decaying matter to pupate. During the pupal stage, which lasts 3–6 days, the larval cuticle hardens and darkens into a brown, cocoon-like case (the puparium or pupa case). Inside this protective casing, the tissues undergo extensive reorganisation, transforming into the adult form. Finally, the puparium bursts open, and the adult housefly emerges, fully developed with wings and reproductive organs. Its wings expand and harden shortly after emergence, and within 24–48 hours, it becomes sexually mature. Adults are highly prolific, rapidly reproducing and ensuring multiple generations can occur within a single month under optimal conditions. This rapid life cycle and reproductive capacity contribute to the housefly's success as a widespread pest. Figure25.development_in_plants_and_animals_025.jpg. Video104.Flies_and_maggots.mp4. The life cycle of a cockroach (family Blattidae) is completed in 3–6 months under favourable conditions, such as warm temperatures and high humidity. Cockroaches undergo incomplete metamorphosis, consisting of three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. After mating, a female cockroach, with a life span of 6–12 months, can produce multiple egg cases, called oothecae, each containing 16–50 eggs, depending on the species. The ootheca is a hard, chitinous structure, 1cm long, containing eggs in rows of eight. The female carries ootheca for a number of days before depositing them in warm, dark, obscure, and moist environments such as cracks, crevices, or near food sources. Within a week, the ootheca turns dark brown. Within 24–60 days, depending on environmental conditions, the eggs hatch into nymphs. Cockroach nymphs are small, wingless, and pale initially but gradually darken and grow with each successive moult. They resemble miniature adults, apart from their lack of wings and reproductive organs. Over a period of 6–12 weeks, the nymphs moult 6–13 times, depending on the species, shedding their exoskeletons as they grow. Each moulting stage, known as an instar, brings the nymphs closer to their adult form. During this stage, the nymphs are highly active, feeding on a wide variety of organic materials, including food scraps, decaying matter, and even non-food substances like paper or glue. Once the final moult occurs, the cockroach emerges as a fully developed adult, complete with wings (in winged species) and functional reproductive organs. Adult cockroaches are reddish-brown to dark brown, with a flattened, oval-shaped body adapted for crawling into tight spaces. They are nocturnal and highly adaptive, thriving in environments with readily available food, water, and shelter. Adult cockroaches can survive for weeks without food and several days without water, making them exceptionally resilient pests, having been around for over 350 million years. Their rapid reproduction, with females producing multiple oothecae during their lifetime, ensures their populations grow quickly, contributing to their success as a persistent and challenging pest. Figure288.3.9.development_in_plants_and_animals_image_002.jpg. Video105.Cockroach_egg_case_bursts_open.mp4. The life cycle of a mosquito (family Culicidae) involves complete metamorphosis, a process typically lasting 7–14 days under favourable conditions such as warm temperatures and stagnant water sources. A female mosquito, with a lifespan of 1 week to several months depending on the species and environment, can lay hundreds of eggs during her lifetime. During mating, which often occurs shortly after emergence, the male mosquito transfers sperm to the female’s reproductive tract, enabling her to fertilise eggs internally. The tiny, oval-shaped eggs of mosquitoes are laid in stagnant water sources such as ponds, marshes, swampy pools, water collected in old pots, tins, leaf axils, or blocked drains and gutters. These eggs, which float on the water’s surface, hatch into larvae within 2–3 days under suitable conditions. Differences exist between species: Culex mosquitoes lay eggs that stick together, forming rafts, while Anopheles mosquitoes lay their eggs singly, each equipped with air floats that help them remain buoyant. Regardless of the species, the earliest stages of a mosquito’s life occur entirely in water. The larvae, commonly called wigglers, are elongated and cylindrical, with bodies divided into the head, thorax, and abdomen. They use specialised mouthparts for filter feeding and have adaptations for breathing at the water's surface: Culex larvae use siphons, while Anopheles larvae rely on spiracles located on the eighth abdominal segment. Swimming tail-first by wriggling their abdomens, the larvae feed on organic matter, microorganisms, and algae. This stage lasts 4–10 days, during which they undergo four moults, growing rapidly and accumulating energy to prepare for the next stage of development. When fully developed, the larvae cease feeding and find a suitable surface, such as a submerged plant or the bottom of a water container, where they anchor themselves using silk threads produced from specialised glands. They then undergo their final larval moult, transitioning into pupae, known as tumblers, which are comma-shaped with two tail fins at the end of the abdomen. These pupae remain relatively mobile but do not feed, breathing atmospheric oxygen through a pair of trumpet-like respiratory siphons on the thorax. Enclosed within the pupal casing, the mosquito undergoes histolysis (tissue breakdown) and histogenesis (tissue reorganisation), transforming into an adult. The pupal stage lasts 1–4 days, depending on environmental conditions, after which the pupal skin splits, allowing the fully developed adult mosquito to emerge onto the water's surface. The newly emerged mosquito rests briefly, often on its pupal case, allowing its body and wings to dry and harden before taking flight. Within 1–2 days, it reaches sexual maturity, ready to mate and continue the life cycle. Females then seek a blood meal, which provides the protein necessary for egg development, while males feed on nectar. Mosquitoes play both beneficial and harmful roles in ecosystems: while some act as pollinators, others are vectors of diseases like malaria and dengue fever, making them a critical focus for public health. Figure27.development_in_plants_and_animals_027.jpg. Video106.How_mosquitoes_lay_their_eggs.mp4. The life cycle of a bee (Apis spp.) involves complete metamorphosis, typically lasting about 16 to 60 days, depending on the species, caste, and environmental conditions. For a honey bee (Apis mellifera), the life cycle is shorter, ranging from approximately 16 to 24 days. Within a colony, the queen bee develops in about 16 days, worker bees take around 21 days, and drone bees require about 24 days to mature. This variation in development time is closely tied to the specific roles and dietary requirements of each caste within the colony. The queen bee can live for several years and is capable of laying thousands of tiny, oval-shaped eggs during her lifetime, which can be either fertilised or unfertilised; fertilised eggs develop into queens and workers, while unfertilised eggs become drones. During a single nuptial flight, male bees transfer sperms to the queen, which she stores in a specialised organ called the spermatheca, enabling her to fertilise eggs internally throughout her life. Unfortunately, the drones die shortly after mating, as their reproductive organs are torn away in the process. The queen lays eggs in wax cells within the hive, where they hatch into legless, creamy-white larvae within 3 days. Worker bees feed the larvae diets that determine their caste: queen larvae are fed royal jelly (bees' milk) exclusively, while worker larvae receive royal jelly for the first three days, followed by a mixture of honey and pollen. Drone larvae are fed only honey and pollen. This larval stage lasts about 5–7 days, after which they spin cocoons around themselves and enter the pupal stage. The duration of the pupal stage varies: queens remain as pupae for about 10–11 days, while workers and drones take approximately 10–14 days as pupae. During the pupal stage, significant transformations occur as the pupae undergo tissue breakdown and reorganisation. Once this stage is complete, the adult bees emerge from their wax cells and rest briefly in the hive, allowing their body and wings to dry and harden before assuming their roles within the colony. Although several larvae can be initiated as potential queens, typically only one queen will emerge successfully from the pupal stage, while any additional queen larvae are often eliminated by the newly emerged queen. Bees play essential roles in ecosystems, particularly as pollinators, contributing to the reproduction of many plants and the overall health of the environment. Their activities significantly impact agriculture and biodiversity, making them vital for food production and ecological balance. Figure289.3.9.development_in_plants_and_animals_image_003.jpg. Video107.Bees_hatching.mp4. The life cycle of a butterfly (order Lepidoptera) involves complete metamorphosis, a process typically lasting 20–40 days under favourable conditions such as warm temperatures and an abundant food supply. A female butterfly, with a lifespan ranging from a few weeks to several months depending on the species, can lay hundreds of eggs during her lifetime. When ready to reproduce, the female releases a scent to attract a mate. During mating, the male deposits sperm into the female’s genital opening, fertilising the eggs internally. The tiny, spherical eggs, often white or greenish-white, are laid singly or in small batches on the undersides of young leaves, usually of specific host plants like citrus. These leaves provide protection from sunlight and rain while serving as the first food source for the emerging larvae. Within 3–10 days, the eggs hatch into caterpillars (larvae), which initially feed on their egg shells before moving on to the host plant's leaves. Caterpillars are characterised by elongated, segmented bodies with vibrant patterns. They possess strong jaws (mandibles) for chewing, three pairs of walking legs on the thorax, and claspers on the abdomen for gripping surfaces. During this stage, which lasts 2–5 weeks, the caterpillars feed voraciously, shedding their exoskeleton multiple times as they grow. This rapid growth allows them to store energy in preparation for the next phase. When fully grown, the caterpillar ceases feeding and anchors itself to a suitable surface, such as a vertical twig, using silk threads. It spins a silk pad, attaches its claspers to it, and suspends itself with its anterior end pointing upwards. The caterpillar then undergoes its final moult, transforming into a pupa (chrysalis). Enclosed in the chrysalis, the pupa enters an inactive phase where larval tissues undergo histolysis (breakdown) and histogenesis (reorganisation), forming the adult butterfly. This stage lasts 7–20 days, depending on environmental conditions and the species. Upon emerging, the adult butterfly has crumpled, soft wings that expand and harden within hours as fluids are pumped through their veins, preparing it for flight. The butterfly becomes sexually mature within 1–2 days, ready to mate and continue the cycle. With its vivid colours and intricate patterns, the butterfly plays a vital role as a pollinator, and its rapid reproductive cycle allows for multiple generations annually, ensuring its survival in diverse habitats. Figure17.development_in_plants_and_animals_017.jpg. Video108.Life_cycle_of_a_butterfly.mp4 • In pairs, research on and produce life cycle diagrams for housefly, cockroach, mosquito, bee, and butterfly; annotating diagrams to illustrate the type of metamorphosis each undergoes. [Assignment 6] {Compare the main characteristics of stages of human development from birth to adulthood, including the developmental stages of a child (physical, behavioural, and cognitive)}. Humans are triploblastic organisms, meaning their embryonic development involves the formation of three germ layers. Additionally, humans are classified as deuterostomes, characterised by their embryonic development, where the blastopore (the initial opening formed during gastrulation) develops into the anus. Human development begins with fertilisation, marking the start of the prenatal period, which encompasses three stages: a) Germinal stage (weeks 1-2): This initial stage involves rapid cell division, forming a blastocyst that travels to and implants in the uterine wall, initiating embryonic development. b) Embryonic stage (weeks 3-8): During this stage, the blastocyst undergoes gastrulation, forming three distinct germ layers—ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These layers serve as the foundation for organogenesis, the process by which major organs and systems begin to develop. c) Foetal stage (week 9 to birth): Marked by rapid growth and organ maturation, the foetus gains weight, develops reflexes, and prepares for life outside the womb. Video109.Pregnancy_how_a_wonder_is_born.mp4. Following birth, human development continues through distinct postnatal stages, each with physical, cognitive, and behavioural changes: Physical development includes growth and changes in body structure, strength, and motor skills (such as coordination and balance). Cognitive development involves improvements in thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities. Behavioural development refers to changes in social interactions, emotional responses, and adaptation to social norms. Infancy (birth to 1 year): Characterised by rapid growth, development of motor skills, sensory awareness, and the formation of attachment bonds. Cognitive development includes learning through sensory experiences and motor actions, with early language skills emerging. Early childhood (1-3 years): Physical skills advance with improved coordination. Symbolic thought begins to emerge, and language develops quickly. Socially, children gain independence and begin understanding social rules. Middle childhood (3-6 years): Steady growth continues with enhanced motor skills. Cognitive development is marked by imaginative play, and social skills progress, fostering cooperation and a sense of self. Late childhood (6-12 years): Physical strength and fine motor skills improve, alongside logical thinking abilities such as understanding conservation and classification. Socially, children deepen friendships and understanding of social norms. Video110.Introduction_to_developmental_psychology_piagets_stages.mp4. Adolescence (12-18 years): This period is marked by puberty and emotional changes. Abstract reasoning develops, along with identity exploration and deeper peer relationships. Early adulthood (18-40 years): Physical abilities peak, cognitive skills mature, and individuals focus on independence, relationships, and career goals. Note that wisdom teeth are part of dental development and typically emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood. Middle adulthood (40-65 years): Gradual physical decline occurs, with cognitive skills often peaking but possibly beginning to decline in some areas. Individuals focus on family, career, and often face new responsibilities. Late adulthood (65+ years): Physical decline becomes pronounced, and cognitive abilities may decrease, though many retain high cognitive function. Social adjustments are often needed due to retirement and aging-related changes. These above stages reflect general patterns in human development, though individual experiences vary widely, influenced by genetics, environment, and personal experiences. • In groups, observe drawings, animations or other sources and discuss the stages of human development; noting the physical, behavioural, and cognitive changes that take place from birth, through childhood and adulthood into old age (in notes and/or drawings). [Assignment 7] {Explore the physical, physiological, psychological (emotional) and behavioural changes associated with adolescence and puberty, also highlight the associated myths}. Adolescence, a vital stage of human development, is a crucial transitional period, primarily driven by puberty, a process of physical maturation where an adolescent reaches sexual maturity and becomes capable of reproduction. On average, girls tend to start puberty about 1 to 2 years earlier than boys. The hypothalamus initiates the hormonal cascade leading to puberty by increasing the release of the kisspeptin hormone. Kisspeptin then stimulates the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which subsequently triggers the release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH stimulates the production of testosterone in males and oestrogens in females, while FSH promotes spermatogenesis in males and follicle maturation in females. This hormonal cascade is influenced by various factors, including genetic, hormonal, nutritional, environmental, and developmental signals, indicating that the body is ready for reproductive maturation. During adolescence, individuals experience rapid growth and significant changes across various domains, including physical, physiological, psychological (emotional), and behavioural changes. 1) Physical changes: a) Growth spurts: Adolescents experience rapid increases in height and weight due to hormonal changes, particularly the surge in growth hormones, oestrogen, and testosterone. b) Secondary sexual characteristics: Puberty brings visible changes such as breast development in girls, voice deepening and facial hair growth in boys, and pubic and underarm hair for both genders. c) Skin changes: Hormonal shifts stimulate oil production, causing hair follicles to become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, often leading to acne, characterised by pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, and other blemishes. 2) Physiological changes: a) Hormonal fluctuations: During adolescence, the significant increase in multiple hormones drives physical changes and influences mood and energy levels. Specifically, the heightened activity of sweat glands, stimulated by the rise in sex hormones, leads to stronger body odour, necessitating improved hygiene practices. b) Menstrual cycles and fertility: For girls, menstruation marks the beginning of reproductive maturity. Irregular cycles are common initially as the body adjusts to new hormonal patterns. c) Metabolic shifts: The body’s metabolic rate can fluctuate, contributing to changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. 3) Psychological (emotional) changes: a) Emotional variability: Adolescents often experience heightened emotions and mood swings, influenced by fluctuating hormones and new social pressures. b) Identity formation: This stage is crucial for developing self-identity, which can lead to questioning and exploring various beliefs, values, and roles. c) Increased self-consciousness: Adolescents may become more aware of how they are perceived by peers, leading to concerns about body image and social acceptance. 4) Behavioural changes: a) Peer influence and risk-taking: Adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence, often experimenting with new behaviours, including risk-taking, which can be a way to explore boundaries and gain social acceptance. b) Shift in social dynamics: Friendships and peer groups become central, often overshadowing family relationships in terms of importance and influence. c) Exploration of autonomy: Adolescents begin to seek independence, showing a desire for decision-making authority, which may sometimes lead to conflicts with parents or caregivers. However, myths often surround the adolescent experience, sometimes leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of normal developmental changes. First of all, dismissing mental health struggles as mere "phases" can hinder healthy development among adolescents who face genuine challenges and reinforce the misconception that such issues are usually not serious. The notion that adolescents are inherently rebellious overlooks the fact that challenging authority is a normal part of identity development and boundary testing. While peers play a role in risky behaviours, risk-taking is significantly influenced by neurological development; the adolescent brain is still maturing, particularly in areas related to impulse control and decision-making. Video111.Changes_to_the_brain_during_adolescence.mp4. Acne, often believed to be a result of poor hygiene, is primarily caused by hormonal changes. Menstruation is a normal bodily function and not a sign of illness or impurity, and engaging in physical activities during menstruation is safe and can alleviate cramps. Although irregular periods in the initial years of menstruation can be a source of concern, they are often a normal part of hormonal stabilisation. Contrary to the popular belief that sex education promotes sexual activity, comprehensive programmes actually delay the initiation of sexual activity, reduce risky behaviours, and promote safe practices. Ejaculation, including wet dreams, is a natural part of development that does not indicate readiness for sexual relationships or fatherhood, and frequent ejaculation does not negatively impact long-term health or fertility. Relying on withdrawal (pulling out) as a contraceptive method is ineffective because pre-ejaculate can contain sperm capable of fertilisation. No contraceptive method is foolproof; while condoms reduce the risk of STIs and pregnancy, combining methods is more effective. Finally, the belief that pregnancy cannot occur the first time someone has sex is misleading, as unprotected intercourse at any time can lead to pregnancy. By addressing these myths with factual information, adolescents can gain a better understanding of their bodies, make healthier choices, and reduce stigma around sexual health. • In groups, research on physical, physiological, psychological/emotional and behavioural changes associated with adolescence and puberty. • In whole group discussion, myths associated with sex, ejaculation, menstruation and pregnancy are to be discussed and debunked. [Assignment 8] {Explore and be able to cope with changes related to secondary sexual characteristics at puberty}. Secondary sexual characteristics are the physical changes that develop during puberty, distinct from primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs. The increased levels of sex hormones—oestrogens in girls and testosterone, the principal androgen in boys—facilitate the development of secondary sexual characteristics and prepare the body for reproduction. For boys, the growth of the larynx and lengthening of the vocal cords lead to a deeper voice, often accompanied by temporary "cracking" as the voice stabilises. Hair growth becomes more prominent in the pubic region, underarms, on the face, and across the body, which may raise considerations about shaving or grooming. Boys also develop a more muscular physique, with increased muscle mass and strength, and their chest widens, creating a broader appearance. The penis and testes enlarge, and sperm production begins, marking a significant stage in reproductive development. For girls, breast development begins, which can sometimes lead to self-consciousness. Fat distribution around the hips and thighs creates a curvier figure, while the hips and pelvic bones broaden to prepare for potential childbirth. Hair growth becomes noticeable in the pubic region and underarms, prompting many to explore personal grooming. The reproductive organs enlarge, and the voice may take on a slightly higher pitch, accompanied by a general softening of muscles. The onset of menstruation (menarche) represents a major milestone, though cycles may initially be irregular as the body adjusts. Coping with the changes of puberty involves recognising that these transformations are natural and a normal part of development. Understanding and accepting these changes can help reduce feelings of self-consciousness or insecurity. Open conversations with trusted adults, healthcare professionals, or peers provide reassurance and create a supportive environment for addressing questions and concerns. For instance, guidance on grooming or shaving can help individuals feel more confident in managing changes like body hair. Engaging in healthy activities, such as sports or creative hobbies, builds confidence and fosters a positive self-image. For girls, educating themselves about menstruation is essential for managing cycles effectively and reducing anxiety, while wearing comfortable and well-fitting bras and clothing can ease the transition into a changing body. Most importantly, learning about these changes through reliable sources equips individuals with the knowledge to navigate puberty with greater ease and self-acceptance, ultimately embracing these developments as key milestones in their growth.

[Assignment 9] {Explore various features related to the process of aging}. Ageing is a complex and multifaceted process that involves physical, cognitive, emotional, and social changes in humans. 1) Physical changes: a) Cellular ageing or cellular senescence: This is a natural process where cells progressively lose their ability to divide and function optimally, often in response to accumulated DNA damage, telomere shortening (the gradual reduction of protective caps at the ends of chromosomes during cell division), oxidative stress, or other cellular stressors. This process plays a dual role in organisms: it contributes to tissue repair and tumour suppression by halting the proliferation of damaged cells, but also promotes age-related decline by impairing tissue regeneration and function. Cellular ageing is marked by changes such as altered gene expression, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The effects of cellular ageing include reduced tissue elasticity, delayed wound healing, reduced response to drugs, and an increased risk of age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, arthritis, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s, impacting quality of life. Chronic accumulation of senescent cells can also trigger systemic inflammation, further exacerbating tissue damage and functional decline. Recent advances in cellular reprogramming have shown promise in reversing aspects of cellular ageing by resetting cells to a more youthful state, notably through the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or transient expression of Yamanaka factors. These breakthroughs suggest potential therapeutic strategies to counteract ageing and improve tissue regeneration. b) Muscle and bone: Muscle mass and bone density tend to decrease with age, making older adults more susceptible to fractures and reduced mobility. c) Sensory decline: Vision, hearing, taste, and smell often diminish, affecting daily activities and quality of life. Common examples include presbyopia (difficulty focusing on close objects) and presbycusis (age-related hearing loss). d) Skin and hair: Collagen production decreases, causing wrinkles and sagging skin, while hair may thin and lose its pigment, resulting in greying. Skin may also develop blotchiness, age spots, or uneven pigmentation due to changes in melanin production and the cumulative effects of sun exposure over time. 2) Cognitive changes: a) Memory and processing: Short-term memory and information processing speed can slow, though long-term memory is often retained. Attention and multitasking abilities may also decline. b) Problem-solving and decision-making: While processing speed decreases, accumulated knowledge and experience (crystallised intelligence) may help maintain effective problem-solving and decision-making skills. c) Risk of dementia: Age-related cognitive decline increases susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, which can lead to dementia, a syndrome characterised by a decline in cognitive functions, including memory, thinking, and problem-solving, affecting a person's ability to perform daily activities. While many individuals may experience some cognitive decline with age, not everyone develops dementia. 3) Emotional changes: a) Emotional regulation: Aging adults often report greater emotional stability and improved regulation, managing stress and negative emotions more effectively than younger individuals. b) Sense of purpose and fulfilment: For many, aging brings a greater focus on relationships, spirituality, and finding meaning in life, contributing to overall emotional well-being. c) Mental health risks: Some older adults may face mental health challenges, such as depression or anxiety, often linked to physical health issues, social isolation, or life transitions like retirement. 4) Social and behavioural changes: a) Social connections: Social networks may shrink due to retirement, health limitations, or the loss of loved ones. This can lead to loneliness or isolation for some individuals, while others find satisfaction in a smaller, more intimate circle. b) Adaptation and independence: Aging can require adjusting to new routines and sometimes relying on support from others, challenging long-held independence. c) Role changes: Many individuals experience shifts in roles, such as becoming grandparents or caregivers, or dealing with the changing dynamics of family and friendships as they age. Generally, staying physically and mentally active, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in social activities can help slow aging processes and enhance overall well-being. Older adults often require more medical attention, including regular check-ups, medication management, and possibly assisted living services. Note that aging is highly individual, and its effects vary widely based on genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. While certain declines are common, proactive health measures can often improve longevity and quality of life in later years. Video113.Why_do_our_bodies_age_2016.mp4.
