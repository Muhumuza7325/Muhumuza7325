Themes ***World Climates*** "@OMD". TOPIC 11 ***MAJOR CLIMATIC ZONES OF THE WORLD*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner locates and knows the major climatic zones of the world and understands the relationship between climate and human activities and the lifestyles in each zone. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the names of some of the major climatic regions of the world (k); b) understand the main characteristics of the climates, factors affecting these characteristics and how each type of climate affects the vegetation of the area (u); c) understand how people’s ways of life are influenced by the climate in each region (u); d) plot the major climatic regions on a world map (s); e) recognise each type of region on photographs (s); f) appreciate that people’s lifestyles are influenced by the type of weather and climate (a, v, gs); g) appreciate that this influence is becoming less as technology helps people to overcome difficulties of their climate and as people move into urban areas. (a, v, gs). Factors affecting climates • describe climate of the local area including the different seasons. • What factors influence the climate and the seasons in your local area i.e., what causes the climate to be like it is and what causes the different seasons? • In groups, discuss and suggest how the following factors may affect climate: • distance from the equator • distance from to a lake or water body • height above sea level • relief i.e., flat or hilly land • winds • changes people have made to the vegetation • In pairs, or individually: • choose any other area of Uganda with a type of climate different from that of your own locality and: • describe this type of climate • Show the difference between the two types and the reasons for the differences. • Pairs work with another pair to describe how the differences in climate affect the ways people live in the two areas. • Using the examples given by the pairs, and examples of other climates, elicit and where necessary, explain the factors affecting climate. • Through discussion, understand how other aspects of climate are affected mainly by rainfall and temperature e.g., cloud cover, humidity, atmospheric visibility etc. Major climatic regions and characteristics • use a wall map or a chalk board map to find out the major climates of the world depending on their distance from the equator: • tropical: equatorial (near equator). • savannah: (between equator and tropics). • desert: (near the tropics). • temperate (north and south of tropics). • polar: (near the poles). • What can you deduce about the differences between each type of climate • Through questioning, understand the main factors affecting temperature and rainfall: Distance from the equator; distance from the sea and wind direction, respectively. • Individually, study the map showing the major types of climate in the world and summarise the information on a table: • In groups, study photographs of each type of climate and identify the type of climate with reasons. • research the type of climate on the Internet;
