TOPIC 1.3.3 ***VIRUSES*** "6 PERIODS" Competency; The learner understands the characteristics of viruses, their means of infection and transmission as well as the symptoms of some key examples. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand that viruses have characteristics similar to other living organisms, and key differences (u); b) understand the symptoms, transmission and prevention of the following viruses; HIV, Ebola, hepatitis, and Cassava mosaic (u, v). [Assignment 1] {What is a virus?}. A virus is an infectious microbe typically consisting of a segment of genetic material (either DNA or RNA) encased within a protective protein coat known as a capsid. The capsid, often built from repeating protein subunits, not only safeguards the viral genome but also facilitates the crucial step of attaching to and entering host cells, thereby initiating the infection. Despite their minute size, viruses possess intricate structures, and are incredibly diverse, exhibiting a wide range of sizes and shapes. Some viruses possess an outer lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane, while others may carry additional enzymes or proteins. These structural variations enhance the virus's ability to replicate within the host. Generally, viruses have a limited lifespan, both outside and within a host cell. Within a host cell, their lifespan is intricately linked to the viral replication cycle, with the goal of producing new viral particles and ensuring the continuation of the viral lineage. Outside the host, they are metabolically inactive and cannot replicate independently, often surviving for only hours or minutes depending on the virus and its surrounding environment. Factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, exposure to sunlight or disinfectants, and the type of surface they encounter can significantly influence how long they remain viable. Some viruses can even form crystals in this inactive state, which can help to preserve them for longer periods. Viruses exhibit a dual nature, offering both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, viruses have become invaluable tools in scientific and medical research, especially in gene therapy, where their ability to deliver therapeutic genes offers hope for treating genetic disorders. Their adaptability and mutability drive advancements in biology and medicine, aiding the development of vaccines and treatments that protect against various diseases. Ecologically, viruses such as bacteriophages play a critical role in controlling bacterial populations, contributing to the balance of ecosystems, while others are used as biopesticides to support sustainable agriculture. Conversely, the harmful effects of viruses are profound. They can infect virtually all forms of life, often causing diseases with varying degrees of severity. Their diversity in transmission and immune evasion strategies makes them formidable pathogens, responsible for numerous human illnesses, from common colds to life-threatening conditions like HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and COVID-19. Viruses are also linked to the development of cancers, such as those caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and the Hepatitis B virus. Beyond human health, viruses pose challenges to food security and economies, as seen with plant diseases like Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), which devastates crops and livelihoods. Additionally, the emergence of new viral threats and the risk of pandemics underscore their potential to disrupt global health and economic stability, highlighting the ongoing need for vigilance, research, and innovation in combating viral threats. [Assignment 2] {How do viruses both resemble and differ from other living organisms?}. (Refer to chapters 1.1 and 1.3). Video152.Viruses.mp4. [Assignment 3] {Differentiate between a sign and a symptom}. Signs and symptoms provide a comprehensive understanding of a situation or condition, aiding in diagnosis, assessment, and planning. Generally, a sign refers to an observable and/or measurable indicator of a situation or condition, while a symptom refers to a subjective experience and/or assessment associated with it. Importantly, recognising this distinction between signs and symptoms is essential for effective communication and collaboration across diverse fields, including engineering, psychology, medicine, and botany. In engineering, signs might include cracks in a structure or unusual sounds from machinery, suggesting potential failure. Symptoms could encompass decreased efficiency or operational difficulties perceived by the user. In psychology, signs could manifest as observable behaviours like agitation or withdrawal. Symptoms would encompass subjective feelings such as sadness or anxiety reported by the patient. In botany, signs might involve observable characteristics like wilting leaves or discolouration. Symptoms could include stunted growth or poor fruit production, reflecting the plant's overall response to stressors. In medicine, signs refer to objective findings like fever or rash. Symptoms are subjective experiences like pain or nausea reported by the patient, reflecting their personal experience of an illness. However, it is important to acknowledge that the distinction between signs and symptoms can be fluid and context-dependent. A particular observation may be regarded as a sign from one perspective and a symptom from another. As a result, the phrase "signs and symptoms" is often used collectively, blending the two, to provide a more holistic understanding of a situation or condition. [Assignment 4] {Explore the symptoms, transmission and prevention of HIV}. HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a retrovirus that attacks the body’s immune system, primarily targeting CD4 cells (T-helper cells), which are a type of white blood cell crucial for coordinating the immune response. Additionally, HIV can also infect macrophages, another type of white blood cell that ingest and digest pathogens. By destroying these cells, HIV weakens the immune system's ability to respond effectively to infections and diseases, making individuals vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. As a retrovirus, HIV replicates by converting its RNA into DNA and integrating it into the host's genome. The virus can lead to various health complications through multiple complex pathways, depending on the specific cells it infects and their locations in the body. A key aspect of HIV's impact is its remarkable ability to remain hidden from different components of the immune system, with its frequent mutations playing a significant role in this concealment. Signs and symptoms of HIV can vary among individuals, but many often experience flu-like signs during the initial acute phase, such as fever, fatigue, rash, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. Following the acute phase, individuals enter the chronic phase, during which the virus remains active but may not present significant symptoms for years. However, as the infection progresses without treatment, individuals may develop additional complications, including weight loss, recurring infections, night sweats, and persistent diarrhoea, ultimately leading to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), the most severe stage characterised by significant deterioration of the immune system. People with AIDS are more likely to get severe cases of opportunistic infections, and without treatment, they typically survive about three years. HIV is primarily transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk. This can occur through unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing contaminated needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Additionally, transmission can occur through blood transfusions with infected blood and accidents that result into exposure to infected bodily fluids, including cuts and open wounds, as well as contact with mucous membranes found in the eyes, nose, or mouth. Preventative measures for HIV focus on reducing transmission risks and ensuring effective management of the virus. The ABC method provides a structured behavioural prevention approach, encouraging individuals to: Abstain from sexual activity (vaginal, anal, or oral) as the most effective way to avoid exposure; Be faithful to one uninfected partner in a mutually monogamous relationship if abstinence is not feasible; and, if neither abstinence nor fidelity is possible, to consistently and correctly use Condoms to reduce the risk of transmission. This strategy acknowledges diverse circumstances and empowers individuals to adopt the most appropriate preventative measures for their situation. Additionally, harm reduction programmes—such as providing sterile injecting equipment and discouraging needle sharing among people who inject drugs, along with ensuring the safety of blood transfusions through the screening of donated blood for HIV—play a vital role in preventing transmission in vulnerable populations. Consistent use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses the virus to undetectable levels, enabling individuals to live long, healthy lives while significantly minimising the risk of onward transmission. ART has evolved over the years to become more potent, better tolerated, and available in fixed-dose combinations. To prevent mother-to-child transmission, comprehensive antenatal care is essential, including ART for pregnant women living with HIV to minimise transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. Where safe alternatives are accessible, exclusive formula feeding may further reduce breastfeeding-associated risks. Biomedical strategies include pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PrEP is a daily medication recommended for individuals at high risk of HIV infection, such as those with an HIV-positive partner or people who engage in behaviours that increase their risk of exposure. It is most effective when taken consistently before potential exposure to the virus. As of January 2025, clinical trials for a twice-yearly injection of PrEP are ongoing, aiming to provide an alternative for individuals who struggle with daily medication adherence and could significantly reduce HIV incidence among at-risk populations, with Uganda among the participants. PEP, on the other hand, is an emergency treatment that must be started within 72 hours of potential HIV exposure. PEP involves taking antiretroviral medications for 28 days to reduce the likelihood of infection. Both biomedical strategies are highly effective when used correctly and should be complemented by regular HIV testing, just like any other preventive measures, as this testing is essential for early detection and timely intervention. Education and awareness campaigns remain crucial, promoting these different strategies, reducing stigma, and encouraging individuals to seek testing and treatment. Most importantly, every 1ˢᵗ of December is recognised as the World AIDS Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about HIV/AIDS, honouring those who have died from the disease, and promoting efforts to combat its spread. There are two main types of HIV: HIV-1, which is the most common and widespread globally, and HIV-2, which is less common and primarily found in West Africa. The distinction between HIV-1 and HIV-2 is based on their genetic differences and the origins of the virus. HIV-1 is believed to have originated from the transfer of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees to humans, while HIV-2 is thought to have originated from a similar transfer from sooty mangabey monkeys to humans. While both types can lead to AIDS, they differ in several ways. HIV-1 is generally more transmissible and progresses more rapidly to AIDS compared to HIV-2. Additionally, HIV-2 is associated with a slower disease progression and lower viral loads in infected individuals. Furthermore, the two types also have different subtypes and strains, with HIV-1 having several subtypes that contribute to its global prevalence, while HIV-2 has fewer subtypes and is less prevalent outside of West Africa. It’s also important to note that some people, particularly those of European descent, have a genetic variant known as CCR5-Δ32 that makes them naturally resistant to HIV-1 infection. While CCR5-Δ32 primarily offers protection against HIV-1, its effectiveness against HIV-2 is less pronounced, as HIV-2 can use different co-receptors for cell entry. Understanding these differences is important for effective treatment and prevention strategies. The earliest identified isolate of HIV-1 comes from an unknown male in Kinshasa, Congo, in 1959. The first identified patient with HIV infection and AIDS was a Scandinavian man in the 1960s who had visited west-central Africa. HIV was first reported in Uganda at the Kasensero landing site on the shores of Lake Victoria in Rakai District in 1982. As of December 2021, approximately 1.4 million people in Uganda were living with HIV, with a prevalence rate of around 6.2% among adults aged 15-49 (meaning that out of every 100 people in Uganda aged 15-49 then, about 6 had HIV). Note that significant progress has been made toward finding a cure for HIV, as evidenced by a report at the AIDS 2024 conference detailing a seventh case of HIV cure in a 60-year-old German man who achieved sustained remission following a stem cell transplant. A study from March 2024 also showed that a virus-like particle could effectively "shock and kill" latent HIV reservoirs, moving us closer to a cure. Generally, researchers are exploring various approaches, including gene therapy to modify DNA for resistance against HIV, and studying "elite controllers," individuals who naturally resist the virus, for insights into potential cures. While we are not yet at the finish line, these breakthroughs signal the possibility of a future where HIV is no longer life-threatening. Video153.HIV.mp4. [Assignment 5] {Explore the symptoms, transmission and prevention of Ebola}. Ebola, or Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), is a rare but severe and often fatal illness in humans caused by Ebola viruses, members of the Filoviridae family. The disease was first identified in 1976, during two consecutive outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in Central Africa, caused by genetically distinct Ebola viruses. Haemorrhagic fever illnesses typically damage blood vessels, impair multiple organs, and disrupt the body’s ability to regulate itself. While some cause mild disease, Ebola and Marburg viruses are notorious for their severity and high mortality rates. The first Ebola outbreak occurred in a village near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire, giving the virus its name. The second outbreak emerged in a remote village several hundred miles away in present-day South Sudan. Scientists later determined that the Ebola viruses had likely existed long before these documented outbreaks. Since then, the majority of Ebola cases and outbreaks have occurred in Africa. The most devastating outbreak occurred between 2014 and 2016 in West Africa, primarily affecting Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Liberia reported 10,675 cases with 4,809 deaths; Sierra Leone had 14,124 cases resulting in 3,956 deaths; and Guinea experienced 3,811 cases with 2,543 deaths. In total, this outbreak resulted in over 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths, making it the largest Ebola epidemic to date. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has also faced multiple outbreaks; notably, the 2018 outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces resulted in 2,787 confirmed cases and 1,867 deaths. Other countries, including Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda, have experienced outbreaks with varying case numbers and fatalities. Overall, the majority of Ebola cases and deaths have occurred in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the DRC. • You can use the internet to obtain data on the number of people that have lost their lives to Ebola in Africa. Then use this data to create graphs showing which countries have been affected most. Ebola typically begins with sudden onset signs and symptoms such as fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. These early signs and symptoms can be nonspecific and may resemble those of other viral infections, making initial diagnosis challenging. As the disease progresses, more severe signs and symptoms develop, including vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, abdominal pain, impaired kidney and liver function, and, in some cases, internal and external bleeding can occur, manifesting as bleeding from the gums, nosebleeds, or blood in vomit and stool. Individuals may also experience red or bloodshot eyes due to conjunctival haemorrhage. The virus is transmitted through direct body contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk, or semen, of an infected person or animal (alive or deceased). Notably, a person becomes contagious only after they begin to show symptoms. The virus can also spread via contaminated surfaces or materials, such as bedding or medical equipment. The virus enters a patient through either a break in the skin or through mucous membranes, such as those found in the eyes, nose, or mouth, which makes the virus particularly dangerous for healthcare workers and caregivers who are in close contact with infected individuals. Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with infected individuals, practising proper hygiene, using personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection when caring for patients, and handling bodies of deceased victims with extreme caution. Please note that Ebola is one of the most lethal viral illnesses, often leading to multi-organ failure and death within days to weeks without prompt treatment. If you suspect exposure to the virus, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. As for treatment, supportive care—including intravenous fluids, oxygen therapy, or medications to stabilise blood pressure or reduce vomiting—can enhance a patient’s chances of survival. Even though there are several experimental treatments that have helped patients with confirmed Ebola in the past, there are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the FDA to treat Ebola. As of January 2025, two FDA-approved Ebola vaccines that protect against the Zaire ebolavirus are available, while several more vaccines are being developed and tested. Most importantly, early detection and rapid isolation of cases, effective contact tracing, continued efforts to develop more effective vaccines and treatments, and comprehensive public health education are critical to controlling the spread of Ebola during outbreaks. Video154.Ebola.mp4. [Assignment 6] {Explore the symptoms, transmission and prevention of hepatitis}. Hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by infections, autoimmune disorders, alcohol abuse, certain medications, or toxins. The most common cause is viral infection, with five main types of hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis vary depending on the type and severity but often include fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Some cases, particularly in chronic hepatitis, may remain asymptomatic for years until significant liver damage occurs. Transmission differs by type; for example, hepatitis A and E are primarily spread through contaminated food or water, while hepatitis B, C, and D are transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, often via unprotected sex, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth. Hepatitis A usually causes a short-term illness and rarely leads to chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B can cause both acute and chronic infections. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C often becomes a chronic infection that can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis D can only occur in people who are also infected with hepatitis B. Hepatitis E usually causes a short-term illness, but can be severe in pregnant women. Prevention measures include practising good hygiene, ensuring access to clean drinking water, safe sex practices, ensuring safe blood transfusion practices, avoiding sharing personal items like razors or needles, ensuring safe injection practices, and receiving vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Generally, early diagnosis and treatment are essential to managing the condition, preventing complications like cirrhosis or liver cancer, and reducing the risk of transmission. Note that Hepatitis can have serious long-term consequences. If you suspect you may have been exposed to hepatitis or are experiencing any symptoms, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Video155.Hepatitis.mp4. [Assignment 7] {Explore the symptoms, transmission and prevention of Cassava mosaic}. Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is a viral infection that affects cassava plants, caused primarily by a group of viruses called cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) belonging to the genus Begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae. This disease is a significant threat to cassava production in Africa and parts of Asia, where cassava serves as a crucial staple food and source of income for millions of people. The symptoms of CMD can vary depending on the virus strain, the age of the plant, and environmental factors. They include the distinctive mosaic pattern on leaves with alternating patches of light and dark green or yellow, leaf distortion and curling, stunted growth, reduced root yield, and prematurely falling off of leaves. In severe cases, infected plants may produce fewer and smaller tubers, leading to significant losses in agricultural productivity. CMD can also impair the nutritional quality of the cassava roots, making them less palatable and more prone to post-harvest spoilage. The primary mode of transmission is through the feeding activity of infected whiteflies, which act as vectors for the virus, introducing it into healthy plants. Additionally, infected planting materials, such as cuttings from diseased plants, can spread the virus between fields and over long distances. Prevention strategies focus on integrated pest management, including the use of resistant cassava varieties, regular monitoring of whitefly populations (avoid planting when whitefly populations are high), using yellow sticky traps to catch whiteflies, and the application of neem oil or systemic insecticides when necessary. Crop rotation to disrupt the disease cycle and cultural practices such as selecting cuttings from healthy plants, removing diseased plants early to prevent further spread, producing virus-free tissue-cultured planting material, and managing weeds, can also help reduce the spread of CMD, ensuring healthier cassava crops and maintaining food security for communities reliant on this vital crop. Note that like CMD, cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a viral disease that poses severe challenges to cassava production and threaten food security in regions where cassava is a staple crop. It is caused by cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs), comprised of two phylogenetically distinct species: CBSV and Ugandan CBSV (UCBSV), which belong to the genus Ipomovirus in the family Potyviridae. While CMD primarily affects cassava leaves, CBSD mainly targets roots, leading to necrosis and severe yield losses, with less prominent foliar symptoms. CBSVs are primarily transmitted through infected stem cuttings and, to a lesser extent, by whiteflies.
