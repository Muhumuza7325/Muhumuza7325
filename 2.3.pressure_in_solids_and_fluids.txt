Theme ***Mechanics and Properties of Matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 3 ***PRESSURE IN SOLIDS AND FLUIDS*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to explain pressure in solids and fluids and identify their applications in everyday life. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand that pressure is the result of a force applied over an area (u, s); b) understand the effect of depth on the pressure in a fluid and the implications of this (u, s); c) understand the nature of the atmosphere and how atmospheric pressure is measured (u, s); d) know the structure of the atmosphere and the significance of the different layers (k, u, v/a); e) understand the use of the Bernoulli effect in devices like aerofoils and Bunsen burner jets (u); f) understand the concept of sinking and flotation in terms of forces acting on a body submerged in a fluid (u); g) understand and apply the Archimedes’ Principle in different situations (u, s, v/a). • In pairs, use blocks of different surface area and plasticine to investigate and then report on the relationship of force and surface area. Solve numerical problems involving force and pressure, using the equation: pressure = force/area, e.g., the pressure a drawing pin exerts if its tip area is 1 mm² and the force used to push it is 2 N, and explain the implications. • In groups, revisit the particle theory, carry out research and explain using a poster or presentation: what happens when a small amount of boiling water is poured into an empty plastic bottle, the cap is placed on tightly, and the water cools. • In pairs, investigate and report on the effect of depth on fluid pressure by making holes in a water bottle at different depths and explain the links between depth, pressure and density and how this may be applied for example in irrigation, water supply, etc. • In pairs, use the expression for fluid pressure i.e., p = hρg to calculate liquid pressure. • In groups discuss and use learning about pressure to explain why: • farm tractors have large back wheels with wide tyres • a hippopotamus can walk in mud easier than a goat • dam walls are built so that they are increasingly thick from top to bottom • rivers flow fastest at narrow sections than at wider sections, though the volume of the liquid does not change. • In groups, use Hare’s apparatus to compare the densities of different liquids and explain in a report, using particle theory: • which of the liquids investigated is more dense • why the pressure at a depth of 10 m in the sea is higher than at the surface • In groups, carry out investigations (using straws, syringes, siphons, and plastic bottles) and research in order to explain the following in a presentation: • how atmospheric pressure is measured using a barometer and why it varies daily • how pressure changes make drinking straw, syringe, siphon and pumps work • how hydraulic machines work • how altitude affects atmospheric pressure and the impact on our breathing, weather, and climate • why a space is left when bottling liquids and why soda bottles do not have flat bottoms. • In pairs, investigate and report, using diagrams, the impact on atmospheric pressure of air moving over a suspended aerofoil section (the Bernoulli effect) and use it to explain why aeroplanes can fly, even though they are denser than air. • In pairs, research the main layers of the atmosphere, and using a poster or presentation, describe their characteristics, the importance of each layer, and explain how: pressure and temperature vary with altitude and region of the Earth, and the impact on weather and climate patterns • In pairs, investigate the forces on a floating body, find the effect of increasing the mass, and explain • why objects weigh less in water than in air and • relate this to density. • In pairs, investigate the relationship between up-thrust and weight of fluid displaced and use the outcomes to inform a presentation on Archimedes’ Principle and the law of flotation. • In groups, apply your learning to explain using a poster or presentation, why ships can float in water, though their material has a higher density than that of water;
