Like all our other chapters in form four, in this chapter too, we shall be building on the previous chapters. You are required to have your notes for the chapters of carbon in the environment, carbon in life and oxidation and reduction. In this very chapter, we shall focus heavily on metals and their extraction. We shall also explore the fertiliser industry. Little attention will be given to content covered in our previous chapters. To start! Industrial processes involve chemical, physical, electrical or mehanical steps that aid the manufacture of item(s) on a large scale. The processed products by most industries in Uganda are usually for both local use and exportation. Industries in Uganda can be categorised into natural resource processing industries and non-natural resource processing industries. Several industrial processes make use of natural resources as raw materials for various products. Natural resource processing industries include: The agricultural produce industry, the beer brewing industry, the cement making industry, the fertiliser making industry, the soap making industry and the paint industry. The rock processing industry. In chapter 9 of book 1, we covered the different types of rocks and their properties. Rocks are processed in a number of industries, including the cement industry, agro-chemical industries and fossil oil industry. The rock processing industry encompasses activities from quarrying to refining natural rock materials. Quarries extract raw materials like limestone, granite, and sandstone. Crushing and screening plants break down these materials into smaller sizes for various applications. Further processing may involve sorting, washing, or refining to meet specific quality standards. These processed rocks are then used in construction, road building, landscaping, and manufacturing. The industry relies on heavy machinery and equipment for efficient operations. Environmental considerations, such as dust control and rehabilitation of quarries, are essential. Continuous innovation drives efficiency and sustainability in rock processing operations. Regulations ensure safety and environmental compliance in the industry. Collaboration among stakeholders fosters responsible resource management and sustainable practices. 


  Let’s begin with metals and their extraction. From our previous chapters, we discovered that metals are generally reactive elements, meaning, they occur in the earth crust as compounds (ores) containing low percentage of the metals. An ore is a rock which contains enough of a metal or a metal compound that can be extracted. It is a naturally occurring substance from which a metal can be extracted. Ores are often metal oxides, although sulphide and carbonate ores are also common. Metals are electropositive (they ionize by lose of electrons to form positively charged ions) and are therefore reducing agents. Physical Properties of Metals. Metals usually have high densities, melting points and boiling points. Some exceptions would be Group I metals (some are less dense than water) and mercury (which is a liquid at room temperature and pressure). Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, and are often shiny, ductile and malleable. Extraction of metals. For a metal to be extracted, its concentration in a given ore must be high. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate (purify) the ore before extracting the metal. The method of extraction normally depends on the position of the metal in the electrochemical/reactivity series. Figure327.4.2.industrial_processes_image_001.jpg. Extraction of metals as a reduction process. Metals in their ores (oxides or other salts) exist in the ionized condition. During extraction, metallic ions in the ores gain the necessary number of electrons to form the corresponding metal atoms. Since the process involves taking up electrons, extraction of metals is essentially a reduction process. Extraction of sodium. The main/principle/chief ores of sodium are: Rock salt (sodium chloride, NaCl), common in salt lakes like lake Katwe in Uganda; Soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na₂CO₃), common at lake Magadi in Kenya. Sodium nitrate (Chile salt Petre, NaNO₃), Common in Chile. Extraction of sodium metal from sodium chloride ore. Sodium is extracted by electrolysis of fused sodium chloride in the Down’s cell using the Down’s process. The solid sodium chloride is poured into the Down’s cell and calcium chloride added to lower its melting point from 800⁰C to 600⁰C. Lowering the melting point saves electrical energy, making the process more economical. The Down’s cell has an outer iron shell lined with firebrick. The iron cathode and carbon/graphite anode are separated by iron gauze diaphragm which ensures that chlorine does not react with hot sodium. Electric current is then passed through the electrolyte where it melts to form sodium ions and chloride ions. A high current (about 30000A) is used to keep the electrolyte in a molten state. NaCl(l) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). The sodium ions move to the iron cathode and are discharged by gain of electron. Na⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Na(l). Molten sodium collects in the inverted trough placed over the cathode, rises up the pipe and is tapped off through the iron vessel. Sodium metal is collected upwardly in the Down’s cell because of its low density that makes it to float over the reacting mixture. The molten sodium is collected under dry nitrogen in the iron tank to prevent it from reacting with air. The chloride ions move to the carbon anode and are discharged by loss of electrons to form chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms pair up forming chlorine molecules (gas) which is collected in a cylinder as a valuable product. 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻. Figure328.4.2.industrial_processes_image_002.jpg. 


Alternative using rock salt. 
Solid sodium chloride (rock salt) and little calcium chloride are fed into Down’s cell. The mixture is electrolysed using titanium or graphite anode and steel or iron cathode. 
The ions migrate to oppositely charged electrodes. At the cathode, Na+ are discharged by reduction being the only ions present. 
Na⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Na(s).
At the anode, Cl– are discharged by electron loss forming chlorine gas. 
2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻. 
The chlorine formed is collected and stored in tightly closed tanks 
The Clorine is dried, liquefied and stored.

Side effects of the process of production and mitigation.

(a) Air pollution by waste gases: Acidic gases can cause acid rain which leads to crumbling of buildings, lowering soil pH and corrosion of roofs made of iron. Mitigation can be done by fitting catalytic converters in exhaust pipes of machines to convert oxides of nitrogen into nitrogen and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. Also by neutralising the acidic gases before releasing waste gases into the atmosphere. 
(b) Leakage of Chlorine. 
(c) Land degradation.

Social benefits: i) Employment opportunity; improved income thus better standards of living. ii) Development of infrastructure e.g., electricity lines, roads, hospitals, schools, etc. 


Physical properties of sodium. It is a white-silvery shiny metal. It rapidly tarnishes in air due to oxidation. It is a relatively a soft metal that can be cut with a metal. This is because of the weak metallic bonds between its atoms. It is less dense than water and hence floats on water when reacting. It conducts both heat and electricity. Chemical reactions of sodium. 1) Reaction with air. Sodium reacts with air when heated and burns with a yellow flame to form a yellow solid of sodium peroxide. 2Na(s) + O₂(g) → Na₂O₂(s). Sodium burns in limited air to form a white solid of sodium oxide. 4Na(s) + O₂(g) → 2Na₂O(s). When exposed for a long time in air, sodium oxide reacts with water forming sodium hydroxide solution, that absorbs carbondioxide from air forming a white crystalline solid of sodium carbonate decahydrate. 2) Reaction with water. Sodium floats and darts on the surface of water as it melts giving off hydrogen gas. 2Na(s) + H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g). 3) Reaction with chlorine. When heated in chlorine it burns brightly forming white fumes of sodium chloride. 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s). Uses of sodium. It is used in vapour lamps producing deep yellow light for street lighting. Sodium is used as a reducing agent in the laboratory. Sodium–potassium alloy is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors. Sodium-lead alloy is used in the manufacture of anti-knock additives for petrol e.g., tetraethyl lead slows down the combustion process of a mixture of petrol and air. Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodium cyanide (NaCN) used in gold extraction. Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodamide (NaNH₂). Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodium peroxide. Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodium hydroxide. Manufacture of sodium hydroxide. It is manufactured by electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride solution. This process is carried out in a special cell called the mercury cell where flowing mercury acts as the cathode and the anode is made of graphite. (Refer to electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride in the chapter of oxidation and reduction). The process of producing sodium hydroxide on large scale has a bad effect on the environment as below; Chlorine gas given off is a pollutant. Mercury is a poisonous metal because it leads or may cause cancer if it leaks into the surrounding water bodies. Sodium hydroxide may cause change in pH of the surrounding soils which is possible when it leaks to the surrounding areas i.e., pH changes from acid to alkaline. Uses of sodium hydroxide. Used in the manufacture of soap and detergents. Used in an analytical practical to find composition of compounds. Used in the manufacture of other compounds. Reaction of sodium hydroxide with metal ions. When sodium hydroxide solution is added to a solution containing a metal ion in a test tube drop wise until in excess, a metal hydroxide is precipitated. Some of the metal hydroxides are insoluble in excess while others are soluble in excess (refer to qualitative analysis under the chapter of salts). Extraction of intermediate metals. The metals are extracted by reduction and there are four basic stages in the process. 1) Concentration of the ore. 2) Roasting of the ore to convert the carbonates and sulphides to oxides and remove water vapour. It is easier to reduce the oxide than the carbonate. 3) Reduction of the ore. 4) Purification/refining of the metal extracted. 1) Concentration of the ore. This process involves removing impurities. Impurities can be separated by physical means e.g., picking by hand, washing, using a magnet or solvent extraction. In the case of copper, the ore is first crushed and then mixed with water. Air is then blown through the mixture and the clean ore separates and collects at the surface as froth. This is referred to as froth floatation. 2) Roasting. The concentrated (pure) ore is roasted in air at high temperatures to produce oxides which are easier to reduce than carbonates or sulphides. Sulphur is removed as sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide driven off from the carbonates. 3) Reduction of the ore. The ore is usually heated in a furnace in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, usually coke (carbon) or carbon monoxide which converts the ore into the required metal. 4) Purification/refining of the metal. The metal obtained is often impure. Purification is normally done by electrolysis in the case of copper and zinc. In other cases, the impure metal is heated in a hearth open to air, where the impurities oxidize and rise to the surface as a scum and can be removed. Extraction of Iron. The main/principle/chief ores of iron are: Haematite, Fe₂O₃; Magnetite, Fe₃O₄; Siderite (Spathic iron), FeCO₃; Iron pyrite, FeS₂; Limonite (Fe₂O₃.xH₂O). If iron (II) carbonate or iron pyrites are used, they are first converted to iron (III) oxide. If iron (II) carbonate is used, it is strongly heated to form iron (II) oxide that is then reacted with air to form iron (III) oxide which can be used for the extraction. If iron pyrite is used, it is roasted in air to form iron (III) oxide and sulphur dioxide which can be used in the manufacture sulphuric acid by the contact process. 4FeS₂(s) + 11O₂(g) → 2Fe₂O₃(s) + 8SO₂(g). Extraction of iron takes place in a special plant called the blast furnace. This is a tall building, approximately 11 meters high, made of iron metal and an inside wall lined with fire bricks. Figure329.4.2.industrial_processes_image_003.jpg. Iron is extracted by reduction from its main ore Haematite, Fe₂O₃ in a blast furnace lined with fire bricks. The raw materials, haematite, coke and limestone are fed into the furnace from the top. They are fed into the blast furnace through a pulley system called the cones and hoppers. A blast of hot compressed air at 1600⁰C is fed into the furnace through the bottom using special pipes called the tuyeres. As the hot air rises up the furnace, it meets coke and burns to produce carbondioxide and a lot of heat is liberated. The heat is used to carry out the reduction process in the blast furnace. The molten iron formed sinks to the bottom of the blast furnace where it is tapped and solidified into blocks of pig iron (iron with a lot of impurities). The role of coke. At the bottom of the furnace, coke burns in hot air to produce carbon dioxide. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g). The carbon dioxide produced is reduced by unburnt coke in the middle of the furnace to produce carbon monoxide, the major reducing agent. CO₂(g) + C(s) → 2CO(g). The role of Haematite. At 700⁰C, within the blast furnace, reduction of iron (III) oxide takes place to form molten iron and carbondioxide. Since iron has high density, it sinks to the bottom of the furnace. Fe₂O₃(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(l) + 3CO₂(g). In the case of magnetite, another commonly used ore for iron extraction; Fe₃O₄(s) + 4CO(g) → 3Fe(l) + 4CO₂(g). The role of limestone. Lime stone is used in the removal of impurities. Limestone decomposes in the heat to form quick lime (calcium oxide). CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g). The quick lime combines with silica (silicon (IV) oxide, SiO₂), the main impurity in the Iron ore to form slag (calcium silicate). This is a neutralization reaction. The carbon dioxide produced as a bi-product in the furnace is quickly reduced by hot coke to carbon monoxide which is required as a reducing agent. CaO(s) + SiO₂(s) → CaSiO₃(l). The slag, being less dense than iron, sinks to the bottom and floats on iron, protecting the iron from being re-oxidized by hot air. The molten iron and slag are tapped off separately at the bottom of the furnace. The bi-products from the blast furnace include: calcium silicate/slag (used for making roads, manufacturing cement, manufacturing glass); waste gases e.g., carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, steam and unreacted nitrogen (used in a heat exchange process to heat incoming air and so help to reduce the energy costs of the process); calcium phosphate (used as an in organic fertilizer). Physical properties of iron. It is silver-grey when freshly cut. It is malleable and ductile. It has high melting point of about 1525⁰C. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity. Chemical reactions of iron. 1) Reaction with air. When exposed in moist air, it readily rusts forming a reddish-brown solid called hydrated iron (III) oxide, Fe₂O₃.xH₂O. 4Fe(s) + 3O₂(g) + 2xH₂O(l) → 2Fe₂O₃.xH₂O(s). Rusting can be prevented by painting or covering the metal with a layer of oil. This protects iron from being exposed to oxygen and water. Sacrificial protection can be used to prevent rusting. A more reactive metal is used as the sacrificial metal and corrodes in place of iron. This is usually done by attaching a block of magnesium or zinc to the iron, or galvanization, where iron is coated with zinc. Plating iron with zinc also protects the metal from direct contact with water and oxygen. (For more details on rusting, refer to your notes on the chapter of water). Iron filings of iron wire, when heated in oxygen, burn to form a blue-black solid of tri-iron tetra oxide, Fe₃O₄. 3Fe(s) + 2O₂(g) → Fe₃O₄(s). 2) Reaction with water. Iron does not react with cold water, but reacts with excess steam to form a black solid of tri-iron tetra oxide and giving off hydrogen. 3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g) → Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g). 3) Reaction with acids. Iron reacts with dilute sulphuric acid to form a green solution of iron (II) sulphate. Fe(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Iron reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form a green solution of iron (II) chloride and hydrogen gas. Fe(s) + HCl(aq) → FeCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). 4) Reaction with chlorine. When iron wire is heated in a stream of dry chlorine, it glows forming a black sublimate. 2Fe(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → 2FeCl₃(s). 5) Reaction with hydrogen chloride. When dry hydrogen chloride is passed over heated iron wire, a white anhydrous iron (II) chloride is formed. Fe(s) + 2HCl(g) → FeCl₂(s) + H₂(g). 6) Reaction with sulphur. When a mixture of iron filings and sulphur is heated in a hard glass tube, the mixture glows red hot and a black solid of iron (II) sulphide is produced. Fe(s) + S(s) → FeS(s). Tests for iron (II) and iron (III) ions. 1) When a solution of sodium hydroxide or ammonia solution is added to a solution of iron salt, a dirty green precipitate insoluble in excess indicates the presence of Fe₂+ ion. The dirty green precipitate is iron (II) hydroxide. Fe²⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Fe(OH)₂(s). 2) If a red-brown precipitate insoluble in excess alkali is formed, it indicates the presence of Fe³⁺ ion. Uses of iron. For making of railway lines. Making saw blades. Making roofing nails. Making roofing sheets. Construction of mechanical structures such as bridges, car bodies and frames. There are three types of iron which are classified based on their percentage purity. The percentage purity also determines the strength and use of the iron. The types of iron are cast iron (pig iron), wrought iron and steel. Cast iron. This is an impure iron which contains relatively high proportions of carbon (4%) and small proportions of other substances such as silicon, phosphorus and sulphur. Such impurities make cast iron to be hard, brittle and to have a lower melting point than pure iron. It cannot be welded and has little tensile strength. Cast iron can be used to make hot water pipes, Bunsen burner bases, cookers, in railings and other purposes where little strain is imposed. Wrought iron. This is the purest form of iron (contains about 0.3% carbon) and is obtained from cast iron by heating it with iron (III) oxide in a furnace by a process known as puddling. The oxygen of the iron (III) oxide oxidizes carbon and sulphur to their respective gaseous oxides, phosphorus to Phosphates (V) and silicon to silicates which form slag. The semi molten mass is then hammered and rolled so that the slag is squeezed out and a mass of almost pure iron remains. It is very tough, malleable and ductile and is therefore used to make iron nails, sheeting, ornamental work, horse shoes and agricultural implements. Wrought iron is sometimes referred to as low carbon steel. Steel. Steel is an alloy of mainly iron with carbon and other elements like manganese, chromium, silicon, cobalt and sometimes tungsten. The quality of steel depends on the amount of carbon present and this in turn determines its intended use. High-carbon steel is harder but more brittle than low-carbon steel. Stainless steel is a mixture of 74% iron, 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Stainless steel is more resistant to corrosion and hence, it is suitable for use as cutlery or surgical tools. Other types of steel include mild steel (99.5% iron, 0.5% carbon), Hard steel (99% iron, 1% carbon), manganese steel (87% iron, 13% manganese) and tungsten steel (95% iron, 5% tungsten). Steel is generally used in the construction of buildings, bridges, ships, car bodies, cutting and boring tools, crushing machines and stainless cutlery such as knives, forks etc. Extraction of copper. The main/principle/chief ores of copper are: copper pyrites (CuFeS₂); cuprite (copper (I) oxide, Cu₂O); copper glance (copper (I) sulphide, Cu₂S) and malachite (basic copper (II) carbonate, CuCO₃.Cu(OH)₂). Extraction of copper from copper pyrites. The ore is first concentrated by a process of froth floatation. In the froth flotation, the ore is ground into fine powder, dissolved in water containing a frothing agent and air is blown through the mixture to agitate the mixture. During this process, the impurities sink to the bottom of the floatation tank while the ore rises to the surface of mixture. The ore is skimmed off from the surface, filtered and dried. The ore is then roasted in a limited amount of air to produce copper (I) sulphide. 2CuFeS₂(s) + 4O₂(g) + heat → Cu₂S(s) + 3SO₂(g) + 2FeO(s). By adding silicon dioxide (sand) and heating the mixture in the absence of air, the solid iron (II) oxide impurity is converted into slag which is poured off with the reaction mixture leaving behind only copper (I) sulphide. FeO(s) + SiO₂(s) + heat → FeSiO₃(l). The remaining copper (I) sulphide is reduced to metallic copper by heating in a regulated supply of air (oxygen). Cu₂S(s) + O₂(g) + heat → 2Cu(s) + SO₂(g). The metallic copper produced is impure copper (blister copper) and has to be purified. Purification of the copper is done by the process of electrolysis. Purification of blister copper (Refer to the chapter of oxidation and reduction). Figure330.4.2.industrial_processes_image_004.jpg. The impure copper/blister copper is made the anode and a strip of pure copper serves as the cathode. The electrolyte is acidified solution of copper (II) sulphate. During electrolysis, pure copper is transferred from the impure copper anode to the pure copper cathode. Therefore, the anode dissolves and decreases in size as the cathode grows bigger. At the anode (impure copper). Cu(s) – 2e⁻ → Cu²⁺(aq). At the cathode (pure copper) Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). Ions above copper in the reactivity series remain in the solution. Uses of copper. For wiring electrical circuits since it is a good conductor of electricity and is relatively cheap. The copper used for this purpose must be very pure since impurities increase electrical resistance. It is used for making ornaments like ear rings and pins, bungles etc., being little attacked by air. It is used for making alloys like bronze (copper and tin) and brass (copper and zinc), copper coinage (copper and tin), German silver (copper, zinc and nickel) Used for making water pipes and boilers. Copper is used as a roofing material because it weathers to acquire a coating of green basic copper (II) carbonate, CuCO₃.Cu(OH)₂.nH₂O, which lends a colourful touch to the building. Used to make bullet shells. For making coins. Chemical reactions of copper. Copper does not react with water and dilute acids because it is lower than hydrogen in the electrochemical series. However, it reacts with concentrated acids. (a) With concentrated sulphuric acid. Copper is oxidized to copper (II) sulphate and the acid reduced to water and sulphur dioxide. Cu(s) + 2H₂SO₄(aq) + heat → CuSO₄(aq) + 2SO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). (b) With concentrated nitric acid. Cu(s) + 4HNO₃(aq) + heat → Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2NO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). (c) With moderately concentrated nitric acid. 3Cu(s) + 8HNO₃(aq) + heat → 3Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2NO(g) + 4H₂O(l). Pure metals are usually not widely used as they are soft and may corrode easily, therefore alloys are used instead. An alloy is a mixture of a metal and one or more elements, which may be metal or non-metal. A pure metal is soft due to the regular arrangement of atoms in the metal lattice. The atoms are arranged in neat layers which slide past each other easily when a force is applied. In an alloy however, the arrangement of atoms is disrupted by the presence of atoms of different sizes. This prevents the layers of atoms from sliding easily, making the alloy harder than the pure metal. Figure331.4.2.industrial_processes_image_005.jpg. Figure332.4.2.industrial_processes_image_006.jpg. pure metal alloy Alloying metals helps to change properties to make it more suitable for a particular use. For instance, an alloy of iron and chromium has greater resistance to rusting compared to pure iron. The alloys of iron covered in this chapter have better properties than iron. Other alloys and their uses (Refer to the chapter of elements, mixtures and compounds). Fertilizers. A fertilizer is a substance containing essential elements for the healthy growth of plants. When added to the soil, fertilizers normally improve soil fertility. The most important elements are: nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and sometimes sulphur. These elements are absorbed by plants as compounds especially as nitrates and phosphates. There are mainly two types of fertilizers i.e. artificial/inorganic fertilizer and organic fertilizers. Artificial fertilizers. These are synthetic fertilizers that contain a high percentage of essential elements i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium; the fertilizers should be cheap and soluble in water. The examples of such fertilizers include: ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, potassium nitrate, liquid ammonia and potassium chloride. Note: 1) Liquid ammonia is very soluble; it can easily be washed away by rain water and can easily evaporate off the soil. 2) A composite/balanced fertilizer contains nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in certain correct proportions and it is normally labeled NPK. 3) Excessive use of ammonium fertilizers renders the soil acidic. It is there fore necessary to add quick lime (calcium oxide) to neutralize the acidity. The added lime also makes the soil more porous for proper air and water absorption. Organic fertilizers (Farm yard manure). These are fertilizers from decomposed animal and plant waste matter such as cow dung, chicken droppings, dead animals, dead leaves, plant branches, coffee husks, etc. Advantages of organic fertilizers. It is cheap since it is prepared by the farmer. No elaborate instruction for application. They provide a suitable habitat for nitrifying bacteria. They last for a long time in the soil thus improving soil texture. They hold water thus keeping the soil moist even in dry season. Disadvantages of organic fertilizers. They cannot be used selectively i.e., on soil which lacks a particular nutrient They harbor pests and diseases which attack the crop. They have to be applied in bulk for effectiveness. They act slowly and are not ready for use any time since they have to be dry first. Advantages of artificial fertilizers. They do not habour pests and diseases. They are available for use whenever needed. They are effective when used in small amounts. Different fertilizers for different crops and soil types are usually available. They normally give a good yield. Disadvantages of artificial fertilizers. They are expensive in terms of production costs. They do not give desired results if the instructions for application are not strictly followed. They may exhaust soil fertility if used for a long time. The crop/yield is of inferior quality to the one produced using organic fertilizers.
