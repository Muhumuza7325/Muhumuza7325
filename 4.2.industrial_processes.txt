Like most of our other chapters in form four, in this chapter too, we shall be building on the previous chapters. You are required to have your notes for the chapters of using materials, carbon in the environment, carbon in life and oxidation and reduction. In this very chapter, we shall focus heavily on metals and their extraction. We shall also explore the cement, alkali and agro-chemical industries. Little attention will be given to content covered in our previous chapters. [Group Work 1] {What are some of the main industries that produce useful chemicals, outline four industrial processes that make use of natural resources obtained in Uganda}. To start! Just like other industrial sectors around the world, Uganda's industrial sector uses large-scale chemical, physical, and mechanical processes to transform raw materials into a vast array of products. The sector extensively thrives on processing its natural resources. The natural resource processing industries of Uganda include the oil industry that refines oil for a variety of fuel products and petrochemicals, metal production and the cement and lime industry that utilise minerals for various applications. Food processing, textiles, and the pulp and paper industry further showcase Uganda's ability to transform raw materials. Beyond direct resource processing, Uganda boasts a wider industrial base including the acid industry, the alkali industry, the agricultural produce industry (which processes agricultural resources), the ever-popular beer brewing industry, the soap making industry, and the paint industry. These diverse processed goods, alongside products from non-natural resource processing industries like pharmaceuticals and light manufacturing, cater to both local needs and international trade, driving Uganda's economic engine. However, this progress comes with a price. Chemical industries, a key player in this transformation, can cause significant environmental damage through air and water pollution. Gas emissions contribute to climate change, while wastewater and solid waste contaminate water bodies and soil, harming ecosystems and potentially impacting human health. This underlines the need for stricter regulations and cleaner industrial practices to ensure sustainable development. [Group Work 2] {Explain in detail, the process of obtaining useful chemicals from rocks}. The rock processing industry. In the very last chapter of rocks and minerals in our form 1, we covered the different types of rocks and their properties. Rocks are processed in a number of industries, including the cement industry, agro-chemical industries and fossil oil industry. The rock processing industry encompasses activities from quarrying to refining natural rock materials. Quarries extract raw materials like limestone, granite, and sandstone. Crushing and screening plants break down these materials into smaller sizes for various applications. Further processing may involve sorting, washing, or refining to meet specific quality standards. These processed rocks are then used in construction, road building, landscaping, and manufacturing. The industry relies on heavy machinery and equipment for efficient operations. Environmental considerations, such as dust control and rehabilitation of quarries, are essential. Continuous innovation drives efficiency and sustainability in rock processing operations. Regulations ensure safety and environmental compliance in the industry. Collaboration among stakeholders fosters responsible resource management and sustainable practices. [Group Work 3] {Detail the process in the manufacture of lime and cement}. The cement and lime industry. The cement and lime industry underpins construction and many industrial processes. Quicklime, its simpler product, is derived by heating limestone in a kiln fuelled by burning coke. This process decomposes the limestone, releasing carbon dioxide and leaving behind pure calcium oxide (quicklime) that collects at the kiln's bottom (refer to your notes on the chapter of carbon in the environment). Cement, a complex material with quicklime as a base, is produced in a multi-stage process. First, limestone and clay are ground together into a fine powder. This powder is then mixed with water and fed into a rotating kiln. Inside the kiln, the mixture undergoes a two-stage heating process. The initial stage reaches a scorching 1500°C, decomposing the limestone into calcium oxide and releasing carbon dioxide. This high temperature provides the energy needed to break the chemical bonds in the limestone molecule. In the second stage, the temperature lowers to a more controlled 1450°C. This facilitates vital chemical reactions between the quicklime and components from the clay, like aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide. These reactions form the desired calcium aluminate and calcium silicate clinkers. Finally, grinding these clinkers with gypsum (calcium sulphate) creates a fine powder – cement – that is then packed in bags, ready for use in construction and various industries. However, cement production has environmental and health downsides. Kiln heat releases air pollutants (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and particulate matter) causing smog, acid rain, and respiratory issues. Pre-heater technologies and alternative fuels can mitigate this by reducing pollutant formation. Decomposing limestone releases significant CO₂, a greenhouse gas. Clinker substitution with supplementary materials and carbon capture technologies can lessen CO₂ emissions. Large-scale resource extraction depletes limestone and clay. Utilising alternative raw materials and optimizing quarries can conserve these resources. The high-heat process consumes substantial energy, impacting fossil fuels and air quality. Improved kiln efficiency and renewable energy sources can minimise energy consumption and its environmental consequences. Grinding raw materials and handling clinkers generate dust emissions harming worker and community health. Dust suppression techniques and vegetation barriers can control these emissions. Finally, water usage strains local resources, especially in dry regions. Water recycling, reuse, and exploring alternative sources can lessen this burden. By adopting these mitigation strategies, the cement industry can move towards a more sustainable future. [Group Work 4] {Describe the production of alkali and chlorine by the electrolysis of salt solution}. The Alkali industry. The principal product of the alkali industry is sodium hydroxide (caustic soda). Manufacture of sodium hydroxide. It is manufactured by electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride solution. This process is carried out in a special cell called the mercury cell, where the flowing mercury acts as the cathode and the anode is made of graphite. During the manufacture of NaOH, chlorine gas is also produced. (Refer to electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride in the chapter of oxidation and reduction). However, the process of producing sodium hydroxide on large scale has a bad effect on the environment. Chlorine gas given off is a pollutant. Mercury is a poisonous metal because it leads or may cause cancer if it leaks into the surrounding water bodies. Sodium hydroxide may cause a change in the pH of the surrounding soils which is possible when it leaks to the surrounding areas, i.e., pH changes from acidic to alkaline. Uses of sodium hydroxide. NaOH is a versatile alkali. It is used in the manufacture of soap and detergents. It is used in an analytical scientific investigation to find composition of compounds. It is used in the manufacture of pulp and paper. Its other applications include water treatment, food, textiles, metal processing, mining, glass making and others. Reaction of sodium hydroxide with metal ions. When sodium hydroxide solution is added to a solution containing a metal ion in a test tube drop wise until in excess, a metal hydroxide is precipitated. Some of the metal hydroxides are insoluble in excess while others are soluble in excess (refer to qualitative analysis under the chapter of salts). [Group Work 5] {Explain in detail, the processes involved in extracting and purifying metals, with particular reference to processes used in Uganda}. Metals and their extraction. From our previous chapters, we discovered that metals above hydrogen in the electrochemical series are generally reactive elements, meaning, they occur in the earth crust as compounds (ores) containing a low percentage of the metals. An ore is a rock which contains enough of a metal or a metal compound that can be extracted. It is a naturally occurring substance from which a metal can be extracted. Ores are often metal oxides, although sulphide and carbonate ores are also common. There are other less frequent ores as well, such as halides (chlorides) or phosphates. Metals are electropositive (they ionize by loss of electrons to form positively charged ions) and are therefore reducing agents. They usually have high densities, melting points and boiling points. Some exceptions would be Group I metals (of which some are less dense than water) and mercury (which is a liquid at room temperature and pressure). Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, and are often shiny, ductile and malleable. Efficient metal extraction relies on concentrated ores. Before extraction, processes like crushing, grinding, and separation techniques are employed to increase the metal content in the ore, making it more economical. The chosen extraction method depends primarily on the metal's reactivity. Less reactive metals typically undergo reduction processes with reducing agents like carbon monoxide while highly reactive metals that resist reduction are often extracted through electrolysis. Figure327.4.2.industrial_processes_image_001.jpg. During electrolysis, the ore is either melted or dissolved in a conductive solution. Electricity then drives the movement of electrons, attracting metal cations in the solution to a negatively charged cathode. These cations gain electrons at the cathode, transforming into neutral metal atoms that plate onto the surface, effectively extracting the desired metal. Extraction of sodium. Rock salt (NaCl) reigns as the main/principle/chief ore for sodium extraction, with vast deposits in salt lakes like lake Katwe in Uganda. While soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na₂CO₃), common at lake Magadi in Kenya and sodium nitrate (Chile salt Petre, NaNO₃), common in Atacama Desert (Chile), can be ores of sodium, they are less significant for direct production. Soda ash has other valuable uses, and sodium isn't always the main target. Similarly, sodium nitrate's worth lies in its nitrates for fertilisers and explosives. Beyond rock salt, seawater represents another vast source of sodium chloride, though extraction is more energy-intensive. Even the brines of underground salt lakes can be tapped for sodium. Extraction of sodium metal from the sodium chloride ore. Sodium is extracted by electrolysis of fused sodium chloride in the Down’s cell using the Down’s process. Solid sodium chloride is poured into the Down’s cell and calcium chloride is added to lower its melting point from 800⁰C to 600⁰C. Lowering the melting point saves electrical energy, making the process more economical. The Down’s cell has an outer iron shell lined with firebrick. The steel or iron cathode and the titanium or carbon/graphite anode are separated by an iron gauze diaphragm which ensures that chlorine does not react with hot sodium. Electric current is then passed through the electrolyte which then melts to form sodium ions and chloride ions. A high current (about 30,000A) is used to keep the electrolyte in a molten state. NaCl(l) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). The ions migrate to oppositely charged electrodes. The sodium ions move to the iron cathode and are discharged by gain of an electron (reduction), being the only ions present. Na⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Na(l). Molten sodium collects in the inverted trough placed over the cathode, rises up the pipe and is tapped off through the iron vessel. Sodium metal is collected upwardly in the Down’s cell because of its low density that makes it to float over the reacting mixture. The molten sodium is collected under dry nitrogen in the iron tank to prevent it from reacting with air. The chloride ions move to the anode and are discharged by loss of electrons to form chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms pair up forming chlorine molecules (gas) which is collected, dried, liquefied and stored in tightly closed tanks or cylinders as a valuable product. 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻. Figure328.4.2.industrial_processes_image_002.jpg. • In groups, identify four industrial processes that make use of natural resources obtained in Uganda (including the manufacture of lime and cement and the production of chlorine). Create charts to: • explain the processes; • identify the social benefits; • identify some of the dangers to the community arising from these industrial processes; • identify steps taken to minimise the danger. Physical properties of sodium. It is a silvery shiny metal. It rapidly tarnishes in air due to oxidation. It is a relatively soft metal that can be cut with a metal. This is because of the weak metallic bonds between its atoms. It is less dense than water and hence floats on water when reacting. It conducts both heat and electricity. Chemical reactions of sodium. 1) Reaction with air. Sodium reacts with air when heated and burns with a yellow flame to form a yellow solid of sodium peroxide. 2Na(s) + O₂(g) → Na₂O₂(s). Sodium burns in limited air to form a white solid of sodium oxide. 4Na(s) + O₂(g) → 2Na₂O(s). When exposed for a long time in air, sodium oxide reacts with water forming sodium hydroxide solution, that absorbs carbondioxide from air forming a white crystalline solid of sodium carbonate decahydrate. 2) Reaction with water. Sodium floats and darts on the surface of water as it melts giving off hydrogen gas. 2Na(s) + H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g). 3) Reaction with chlorine. When heated in chlorine it burns brightly forming white fumes of sodium chloride. 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s). Uses of sodium. It is used in vapour lamps producing deep yellow light for street lighting. Sodium is used as a reducing agent in the laboratory. Sodium–potassium alloy is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors. Sodium-lead alloy is used in the manufacture of anti-knock additives for petrol e.g., tetraethyl lead slows down the combustion process of a mixture of petrol and air. Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodium cyanide (NaCN) used in gold extraction. Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodamide (NaNH₂). Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodium peroxide. Sodium is used in the manufacture of sodium hydroxide. Extraction of aluminium. In a multi-stage process, aluminium is extracted from the bauxite ore, which contains aluminium oxide (Al₂O₃). First, the bauxite is crushed and finely ground to increase its surface area for the Bayer process, allowing better contact between sodium hydroxide and aluminium oxide for an efficient chemical reaction. The bayer process refines the bauxite into alumina through a series of chemical reactions. The bauxite is digested with hot, concentrated sodium hydroxide, converting the aluminium oxide to soluble sodium aluminate and leaving behind impurities as "red mud". Al₂O₃.2H₂O(s) + 2NaOH(aq) → 2NaAlO₂(aq) + 3H₂O(l). The mixture is then clarified, separating the clear sodium aluminate solution from the unwanted impurities (red mud) using techniques like settling and filtration. Next, aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the cooled sodium aluminate solution by seeding it with aluminium hydroxide crystals. NaAlO₂(aq) + 2H₂O(l) → Al(OH)₃(s) + NaOH(aq). Finally, the aluminium hydroxide is heated in rotary kilns or fluidised bed calciners to remove water, producing anhydrous alumina (Al₂O₃), the purified form for the next stage. 2Al(OH)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3H₂O(g). The alumina then undergoes the Hall-Héroult process, an electrolytic reduction method. Here, the purified alumina is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) to lower its melting point and increase conductivity. The logic is the ions in the aluminium oxide must be free to move so that electricity can pass through it. However, Al₂O₃ has a very high melting point (over 2000°C) so it would be expensive to melt it. Neither does it dissolve in water, but it does dissolve in molten cryolite (an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide). The use of cryolite reduces some of the energy costs involved in extracting aluminium. Within an electrolysis cell with a carbon/graphite cathode and carbon/graphite anodes, an electric current drives the reduction of aluminium ions (Al³⁺) (dissolved in molten cryolite) to aluminium metal (Al) at the cathode, while the oxygen ions (O²⁻) act as electron acceptors at the anode, taking electrons and causing the carbon anode to react and release CO₂. As such, the positive electrodes must be replaced frequently. This consumption of the carbon anode is a necessary but ongoing cost in the aluminium extraction process. Cathode: Al³⁺(l) (dissolved in molten cryolite) + 3e⁻ → Al(s). Anode: 2O²⁻(l) (dissolved in molten cryolite) + C(s) → CO₂(g) + 4e⁻. The overall reaction is 2Al₂O₃(s) + 3C(s) → 4Al(s) + 3CO₂(g). The resulting aluminium is about 99-99.5% pure and may undergo further purification depending on its intended use. Uses of aluminium. Aluminium's lightweight nature, durability, and good conductivity make it a highly sought-after metal across numerous industries. Aluminium's lightness and strength make it ideal for cars, planes, and even ships, leading to better fuel efficiency. Buildings, electrical grids, and even window frames benefit from aluminium's strength and ease of working with. Aluminium cans and foil are popular due to their ability to be formed into different shapes and their eco-friendly recycling potential. Aluminium's heat transfer makes it a great choice for appliances and electronics, while its lightness is perfect for laptops and phones. Aluminium's versatility extends to sporting equipment and other applications, highlighting its importance in our modern world. Metal extraction by the reduction process. Reduction is a powerful technique for extracting metals, especially from oxide ores. The process is commonly used for metals like iron (from iron ore) and copper (from sulphide ores). Even in the multi-stage process for obtaining titanium, reduction remains a key step. Metal extraction by reduction is a four-stage process. The first step, concentration of the ore, is crucial and involves separating the desired metal from unwanted impurities. Techniques like crushing and grinding break down the ore for easier separation. For distinct impurities, physical methods like hand-picking, washing, magnets, or even solvent extraction might be used. A key technique, however, is flotation. Here, the ore is mixed with water and air bubbles. Due to their wettability, the desired metal particles attach to these bubbles and rise as a froth, while unwanted minerals remain suspended. This "froth," rich in the target metal, is then collected. Copper extraction exemplifies this process – crushed ore and air bubbles create a copper-rich froth at the surface, a technique known as froth flotation. The second stage, roasting (optional for some ores), involves heating the concentrated ore in air at high temperatures. This process removes any leftover water vapour and, for ores containing carbonates or sulphides, converts them to oxides. The advantage? Oxides are easier to reduce than their carbonate and sulphide counterparts, making the next stage – reduction – more efficient. Sulphur from the sulphides is released as sulphur dioxide gas (SO₂) during this conversion, while carbon dioxide (CO₂) is driven off from the carbonates. So, roasting acts like a prep step, simplifying the reduction process for specific ores. The heart of the process is reduction. The ore is heated in a furnace alongside a reducing agent, typically coke (carbon) or carbon monoxide. This reducing agent, with its stronger attraction to oxygen, "donates" electrons to metal cations trapped within the oxide ore. This transforms the metal cations into pure metal atoms, separating the desired metal from waste materials. Finally, the extracted metal, often impure, undergoes purification or refining to achieve the desired level of purity. Electrolysis, a popular choice for copper and zinc, utilises electricity for separation. Distillation, suitable for low-boiling-point metals like mercury, purifies by vaporisation. In some cases, an open furnace is used. Here, impurities, more prone to oxidation, react with air to form a skimmable scum on the surface, leaving the purified metal behind. This efficient, four-stage approach highlights the power and versatility of metal extraction by reduction in extracting a variety of pure metals from iron in iron ore to copper in sulphide ores. Extraction of Iron. The main/principle/chief ores of iron are haematite/Fe₂O₃, magnetite/Fe₃O₄, siderite/spathic iron/FeCO₃, iron pyrite/FeS₂ and limonite/Fe₂O₃.xH₂O. Ores, FeCO₃ and FeS₂, containing iron in the +2 oxidation state (Fe²⁺), require a conversion step before iron extraction. FeCO₃ is heated to form FeO, which then reacts with air to form the desired Fe₂O₃. This Fe₂O₃ is more suitable for the reduction process used to extract iron metal. Similarly, iron pyrite/FeS₂ is roasted in air to convert it to Fe₂O₃, with the beneficial byproduct of SO₂ gas, that can be used in sulphuric acid production by the contact process. 4FeS₂(s) + 11O₂(g) → 2Fe₂O₃(s) + 8SO₂(g). This pre-processing step ensures efficient extraction of iron metal in the subsequent stages. Iron, a vital metal, is often extracted by reduction from its main ore, haematite/Fe₂O₃, within a special high-temperature chamber known as a blast furnace (a tall building, approximately 11 meters high, made of iron metal and an inside wall lined with fire bricks). Figure329.4.2.industrial_processes_image_003.jpg. The raw materials, hematite (Fe₂O₃), coke (carbon source), and limestone (flux) are fed into the furnace from the top. They are fed into the blast furnace through a pulley system called the cones and hoppers. A blast of hot, compressed air at 1600⁰C is fed into the furnace through the bottom using special pipes called the tuyeres. In summary, as the hot air rises up the furnace, it meets coke and burns to produce carbondioxide and a lot of heat is liberated. The heat is used to carry out the reduction process in the blast furnace. The molten iron formed sinks to the bottom of the blast furnace where it is tapped and solidified into blocks of pig iron (iron with a lot of impurities) for further processing. Meanwhile, the hot air reacts with excess coke to produce CO₂, which is then reduced by more coke to create CO, the key reducing agent. This continuous cycle efficiently extracts iron from its ore. The role of coke. At the bottom of the furnace, coke burns in hot air to produce carbon dioxide. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g). The carbon dioxide produced is reduced by unburnt coke in the middle of the furnace to produce carbon monoxide, the major reducing agent. CO₂(g) + C(s) → 2CO(g). The role of Haematite. At 700⁰C, within the blast furnace, carbon monoxide (CO) from the coke reacts with haematite, stripping away oxygen and transforming iron (III) oxide into molten iron (Fe) and carbondioxide. Since iron has a high density, it sinks to the bottom of the furnace. Fe₂O₃(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(l) + 3CO₂(g). In the case of magnetite, another commonly used ore for iron extraction; Fe₃O₄(s) + 4CO(g) → 3Fe(l) + 4CO₂(g). The role of limestone. Lime stone is used in the removal of impurities. It acts as a flux, its components combining with impurities in the ore to form a liquid slag that floats on top of the molten iron. It decomposes in the heat to form quicklime (calcium oxide). CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g). The quicklime combines with silica (silicon (IV) oxide, SiO₂), the main impurity in the Iron ore to form slag (calcium silicate). This is a neutralisation reaction. The carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct in the furnace is quickly reduced by hot coke to carbon monoxide which is required as a reducing agent. CaO(s) + SiO₂(s) → CaSiO₃(l). The slag, being less dense than iron, sinks to the bottom and floats on iron, protecting the iron from being re-oxidized by hot air. The molten iron and slag are tapped off separately at the bottom of the furnace. The bi-products from the blast furnace include: calcium silicate/slag (used for making roads, manufacturing cement and manufacturing glass); waste gases e.g., carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, steam and unreacted nitrogen (used in a heat exchange process to heat incoming air, reducing the energy costs of the process); calcium phosphate (used as an inorganic fertiliser). Physical properties of iron. Iron boasts a silver-grey, metallic lustre when freshly cut. It's a testament to human ingenuity – despite its high melting point (around 1525°C), iron can be shaped due to its malleability and ductility. A good conductor of heat and electricity, iron plays a vital role in various applications. Chemical reactions of iron. 1) Iron, while strong and versatile, has a nemesis – moist air. Exposed to it, iron readily undergoes rusting, forming a reddish-brown hydrated iron (III) oxide (Fe₂O₃.xH₂O). 4Fe(s) + 3O₂(g) + 2xH₂O(l) → 2Fe₂O₃.xH₂O(s). This reaction highlights iron's transition to the +3 oxidation state. To combat rust, we have some clever strategies. Painting or oiling the iron surface creates a barrier against oxygen and water. Alternatively, we can use a more reactive metal like magnesium or zinc as a sacrificial anode. This metal corrodes first, protecting the iron in a process known as sacrificial protection or galvanization (when zinc is used as the coating). (For more details on rusting, refer to your notes on the chapter of water). At high temperatures, the relationship between iron and oxygen changes. Iron filings heated in oxygen burn vigorously, forming a blue-black solid of tri-iron tetra oxide, Fe₃O₄. 3Fe(s) + 2O₂(g) → Fe₃O₄(s). This reaction showcases iron's ability to form different oxides under varying conditions. 2) Reaction with water. Iron does not react with cold water, but reacts with excess steam to form a blue-black solid of tri-iron tetra oxide and giving off hydrogen. 3Fe(s) + 4H₂O(g) → Fe₃O₄(s) + 4H₂(g). 3) Reaction with acids. Iron reacts with dilute sulphuric acid to form a green solution of iron (II) sulphate. Fe(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → FeSO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Iron reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form a green solution of iron (II) chloride and hydrogen gas. Fe(s) + HCl(aq) → FeCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). It's important to note that these reactions occur with dilute acids. Concentrated acids can behave differently and may require additional considerations. 4) Reaction with chlorine. When iron wire is heated in a stream of dry chlorine, it glows forming a black sublimate. 2Fe(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → 2FeCl₃(s). 5) Reaction with hydrogen chloride. When dry hydrogen chloride is passed over heated iron wire, a white anhydrous iron (II) chloride is formed. Fe(s) + 2HCl(g) → FeCl₂(s) + H₂(g). 6) Reaction with sulphur. When a mixture of iron filings and sulphur is heated in a hard glass tube, the mixture glows red hot and a black solid of iron (II) sulphide is produced. Fe(s) + S(s) → FeS(s). Tests for iron (II) and iron (III) ions. 1) When a solution of sodium hydroxide or ammonia solution is added to a solution of iron salt, a dirty green precipitate insoluble in excess indicates the presence of Fe²⁺ ion. The dirty green precipitate is iron (II) hydroxide. Fe²⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Fe(OH)₂(s). 2) If a reddish-brown precipitate insoluble in excess alkali is formed, it indicates the presence of Fe³⁺ ion. Excess alkali is important to ensure complete precipitation and distinguish between the two iron ions. Pure metals are generally not favoured for everyday use because they tend to be soft and are susceptible to corrosion. Alloys, on the other hand, offer a multitude of advantages. By combining a metal with one or more elements (metallic or non-metallic), alloys disrupt the regular arrangement of atoms in the metal lattice. This disruption caused by the presence of different sized atoms prevents the layers of atoms from sliding easily, making the alloy harder than the pure metal. However, the benefits of alloys extend beyond just hardness. Alloys can be significantly stronger, more resistant to corrosion, and even have tailored properties depending on the specific elements used. Figure331.4.2.industrial_processes_image_005.jpg. Figure332.4.2.industrial_processes_image_006.jpg. For instance, carbon increases hardness and strength in steel, while chromium provides excellent corrosion resistance in stainless steel. Common alloying elements include carbon, manganese, chromium, and nickel, each playing a crucial role in shaping the final properties of the alloy. Other alloys and their uses (Refer to the chapter of elements, mixtures and compounds). There are three types of iron which are classified based on their percentage purity. The percentage purity also determines the strength and use of the iron. The types of iron are cast iron (pig iron), wrought iron and steel. 1) Cast iron. This is an impure iron birthed from blast furnaces. It contains relatively high proportions of carbon (2-4)% and small proportions of other substances such as silicon, phosphorus and sulphur. While these impurities grant it a high melting point compared to pure iron for casting and make it hard, they also limit its formability (cannot be welded) and strength. Despite its brittleness, cast iron's affordability and excellent casting properties make it a workhorse material in hot water pipes, Bunsen burners, cookware, and decorative railings, and other purposes where little strain is imposed, showcasing human ingenuity in utilising this versatile yet limited form of iron. 2) Wrought iron. This is the purest form of iron (containing about 0.3% carbon) and is obtained from cast iron by heating it with iron (III) oxide in a furnace by a process known as puddling. The oxygen of the iron (III) oxide oxidises carbon and sulphur to their respective gaseous oxides (CO, CO₂, SO₂). Other impurities like phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si) are transformed into phosphates and silicates, respectively, which combine to form a slag (semi-molten silicate material). The semi-molten iron, after most impurities are removed, is then hammered and rolled. This process physically squeezes out the slag, leaving behind a near-pure iron mass. Due to its low carbon content, wrought iron exhibits excellent malleability (easily shaped), ductility (can be drawn into wires), and toughness. These properties made it historically valuable for applications requiring shaping and strength, such as: iron nails and sheeting, ornamental work (due to its forgeability), horseshoes (needing toughness), and agricultural implements (durability is key). Wrought iron is sometimes referred to as "low carbon steel." However, the development of steel, which allows for precise control of carbon content and other alloying elements, has reduced the widespread use of wrought iron. 3) Steel. This is an alloy of mainly iron with carbon and other elements like manganese, chromium, silicon, cobalt and sometimes tungsten. The quality of steel depends on the amount of carbon present and this in turn determines its intended use. High-carbon Steel boasts superior hardness, making it ideal for cutting and boring tools. However, the trade-off is brittleness, meaning it can break more easily under stress. Low-carbon Steel with a lower carbon content, offers greater ductility (ability to be shaped) and is often used in construction applications like buildings, bridges, and car bodies. Stainless steel stands out for its exceptional corrosion resistance. This is achieved by incorporating a significant amount of chromium (around 18%) and nickel (around 8%) alongside the iron base (around 74%). This unique blend makes stainless steel perfect for applications where hygiene and resistance to rust are critical, such as cutlery and surgical tools. Beyond these main categories, a variety of steels exist with tailored properties achieved by adjusting the carbon content and incorporating other elements: Mild Steel (99.5% iron, 0.5% carbon) offers a good balance between formability and strength, hard steel with a slightly higher carbon content (99% iron, 1% carbon) prioritizes hardness for tools, manganese steel incorporates a significant amount of manganese (87% iron, 13% manganese) to enhance its toughness and wear resistance and tungsten steel (95% iron, 5% tungsten) has exceptional hardness, often used in high-performance cutting tools. Steel is generally used in the construction of buildings, bridges, ships, car bodies, cutting and boring tools, crushing machines and stainless cutlery such as knives, forks etc. Indeed, steel is a true testament to human ingenuity in crafting a material that shapes our world. General uses of iron. Iron's desirable properties, including high strength, malleability, and relative affordability, have positioned it as a cornerstone material in various scientific and engineering applications. Its structural prowess is evident in railway lines, bridges, and car bodies, where its ability to withstand significant stress and weight loads makes it a reliable choice. Furthermore, iron's role extends to tools; the hardness of high-carbon steel makes it ideal for saw blades, while its forgeability allows for the shaping of roofing nails. Beyond construction and tools, iron finds its way into the scientific realm through its magnetic properties. Certain iron types are crucial for electromagnets, which are fundamental components in motors, generators, and even medical marvels like MRI machines. The versatility and scientific applications of iron solidify its place as a crucial element in our modern world. Extraction of copper. The main/principle/chief ores of copper are: i) Copper pyrites (CuFeS₂), also known as chalcopyrite. This is the most abundant copper ore. It's a sulphide mineral containing copper, iron, and sulphur. ii) Cuprite (Cu₂O): This copper (I) oxide is a reddish-brown mineral that's relatively rare compared to chalcopyrite. iii) Copper Glance (Cu₂S): This is a copper (I) sulphide mineral. Copper glance has a high copper content and a dark gray to bluish black appearance. iv) Malachite (CuCO₃.Cu(OH)₂): This basic copper (II) carbonate is a beautiful green mineral, often prized for its decorative uses. However, it's not as abundant as the sulphide ores for copper extraction. These copper ores are the starting point for the extraction process, which involves separating the copper metal from the other elements it's combined with in the ore. Extraction of copper from copper pyrites. The copper pyrite ore undergoes a multi-step transformation to yield the prized metal. The ore is first concentrated by a process known as froth flotation. In this process, the ore is ground into fine powder, dissolved in water containing a frothing agent and air is blown through the mixture to agitate it. The impurities sink to the bottom of the flotation tank while the ore rises to the surface of the mixture. The ore is skimmed off from the surface, filtered and dried. The ore is then roasted in a limited amount of air to produce copper (I) sulphide. 2CuFeS₂(s) + 4O₂(g) + heat → Cu₂S(s) + 3SO₂(g) + 2FeO(s). By adding silicon dioxide (sand) and heating the mixture in the absence of air, the solid iron (II) oxide impurity is converted into slag which is poured off with the reaction mixture, leaving behind only copper (I) sulphide. FeO(s) + SiO₂(s) + heat → FeSiO₃(l). The remaining copper (I) sulphide is reduced to metallic copper by heating in a regulated supply of air (oxygen). Cu₂S(s) + O₂(g) + heat → 2Cu(s) + SO₂(g). The metallic copper produced is impure copper (blister copper) and has to be purified. Purification of the copper is done by the process of electrolysis. Purification of blister copper (Refer to the chapter of oxidation and reduction). Figure330.4.2.industrial_processes_image_004.jpg. The impure/blister copper is made the anode and a strip of pure copper serves as the cathode. The electrolyte is an acidified solution of copper (II) sulphate. During electrolysis, pure copper is transferred from the impure copper anode to the pure copper cathode. Therefore, the anode dissolves and decreases in size as the cathode grows bigger. At the anode (impure copper). Cu(s) – 2e⁻ → Cu²⁺(aq). At the cathode (pure copper) Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). Importantly, any elements present in the blister copper that are less reactive than copper (based on the reactivity series) remain in the solution as they don't readily lose electrons to enter the solution. This leaves behind pure copper on the cathode. Uses of copper. Copper's conductivity shines brightest in electrical wiring due to its ability to efficiently carry current, but for this role, purity is key to avoid resistance. Beyond its electrical prowess, copper's resistance to corrosion makes it a favourite for beautiful and durable ornaments like ear rings and pins, bungles etc. Copper roofing weathers beautifully, developing a protective green patina (CuCO₃.Cu(OH)₂.nH₂O) that adds a touch of colour. Functionality also benefits as copper tackles tasks in water pipes and boilers due to its durability. Copper's alloying power extends its reach, with bronze (copper and tin) offering strength and brass (copper and zinc) showcasing workability. From the strength and workability needed for bullet shells to its historical role in coinage (often alloyed with tin), copper's versatility is undeniable. Chemical reactions of copper. Copper does not react with water and dilute acids because it is lower than hydrogen in the electrochemical series. However, it reacts with concentrated acids. (a) With concentrated sulphuric acid. Copper is oxidized to copper (II) sulphate and the acid is reduced to water and sulphur dioxide. Cu(s) + 2H₂SO₄(aq) + heat → CuSO₄(aq) + 2SO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). (b) With concentrated nitric acid. Cu(s) + 4HNO₃(aq) + heat → Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2NO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). (c) With moderately concentrated nitric acid. 3Cu(s) + 8HNO₃(aq) + heat → 3Cu(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2NO(g) + 4H₂O(l). • In pairs research and describe the reactions involved in the extraction and purification of metals from their ores (iron, copper, and aluminium) and prepare presentation flow charts outlining the main processes. [Group Work 6] {What is the importance of nitrates as fertilisers in food production and how are nitrates produced from the nitrogen in the air}. The agro-chemical Industry. Agrochemicals, the powerhouse of modern agriculture, provide essential tools to enhance crop yields. They encompass two main categories: chemical fertilisers, which enrich the soil with vital nutrients for plant growth, and pesticides, which combat pests, insects, and diseases that threaten crops. The fertiliser industry. A fertiliser is a substance containing essential elements for the healthy growth of plants. Fertilisers can be broken down into two key components: Active ingredients, which are the specific elements or compounds that directly benefit plants (like nitrogen for leaves, phosphorus for roots, and potassium for strength), and inert ingredients that play a supporting role by stabilising or preserving the active ingredients, aiding in application, or extending shelf life. These essential plant nutrients are often absorbed by plants as nitrates and phosphates. There are two main types of fertilisers: Artificial/inorganic fertilisers, which are synthetically produced and offer a high concentration of nutrients (often water-soluble for easy uptake by plants) like ammonium sulphate (a good source of both nitrogen and sulphur), ammonium phosphate (providing both nitrogen and phosphorus), potassium nitrate (rich in potassium and readily available nitrogen), liquid ammonia (a concentrated nitrogen source), potassium chloride (a major source of potassium) and potassium sulphate/sulphate of potash (another common fertiliser used to replenish potassium in the soil). Some other common fertilisers and their compositions: NPK (17:17:17): A composite/balanced fertiliser providing equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. CAN (Calcium Ammonium Nitrate [27:0:0]): High in nitrogen, ideal for promoting early leaf growth. DAP (Diammonium Phosphate [18:52:0]): Rich in phosphorus, crucial for root development and early crop growth. SOA (Sulphate of Ammonia [20:0:0]): Another nitrogen-rich option, with the added benefit of sulphur, which can improve plant health. Organic fertilisers, on the other hand, are derived from decomposed natural materials like animal manure, compost, and plant residues. Advantages and disadvantages of artificial fertilisers. Artificial fertilisers, a cornerstone of modern agriculture, offer a wealth of advantages but also come with considerations. Unlike organic options, they're less likely to harbour pests and diseases, and they're consistently available, providing a potent dose of nutrients even in small quantities. This tailored approach caters to specific crops and soil types, significantly boosting yields. However, their production costs can be high, and achieving optimal results hinges on precise application – improper use can lead to diminished returns. Furthermore, overreliance on artificial fertilisers can deplete the soil's natural fertility in the long run, potentially harming its health. Finally, there are concerns that crops grown with these fertilisers may be of inferior quality compared to those raised organically. Advantages and disadvantages of organic fertilisers. Organic fertilisers, a sustainable choice for plant nutrition, offer several benefits. Being farmer-made from compost or manure, they're cost-effective and require less application fuss. They create a suitable habitat for helpful soil microbes such as nitrifying bacteria and decompose slowly, providing sustained nutrient release and improved soil texture that holds water more effectively during dry spells. However, organic fertilisers also have limitations. Precise nutrient delivery can be tricky due to their varied composition, and they may harbour weed seeds or pathogens. They often require bulk application for effectiveness and take time to act as they decompose gradually, not offering an immediate nutrient boost. Note that the choice between organic and artificial fertilisers hinges on factors like the soil condition, crop requirements, and the desired nutrient release rate. In some cases, a combination of both might be the most effective strategy. The role of nitrogen in making nitrogenous fertilisers. Nitrogen is quite a vital element as it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound used by plants to absorb sunlight energy necessary for photosynthesis. It is also a major component of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. This makes nitrogenous fertilisers the most important fertilisers to farmers. Nitrogenous fertilisers represent a major industry worldwide, accounting for nearly 100 million tons of various products per year. Such fertilisers include many types of products, among which the most common ones are sulphate of ammonia, ammonium nitrate and urea. Ammonia is produced from the Haber process (refer to the chapter of chemical reactions). Anhydrous ammonia is often stored as a liquid under pressure or refrigerated. However, liquid ammonia is very soluble, thus can easily be washed away by rain water and can easily evaporate off the soil. For ease of handling, anhydrous ammonia is often converted to other types of fertilisers. Manufacture of ammonium nitrate. In the first step, nitric acid is manufactured from the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to give products that are dissolved in water (The Ostwald’s process) (refer to the chapter of chemical reactions). Concentrated nitric acid (50-70)% and ammonia gas are then mixed together in a tank and a neutralisation reaction occurs at (100-180)°C, producing ammonium nitrate, which can be further concentrated and converted to a solid form (granules). Manufacture of urea. Urea, a crucial fertiliser and industrial chemical, is synthesised through the reaction of ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) under high pressure and temperature. Ammonia, often produced via the Haber process (N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)), is the starting point. The key reaction, the Bazarov reaction, then combines ammonia with CO₂ to form ammonium carbamate (NH₂COONH₄). 2NH₃(g) + CO₂(g) → NH₂COONH₄(s). This unstable intermediate decomposes at slightly lower pressure to yield the desired product, urea (CO(NH₂)₂), along with water (H₂O). NH₂COONH₄(s) → CO(NH₂)₂(s) + H₂O(l). The resulting urea solution can be concentrated and crystallised to form solid prills or granules for easier storage, transportation, and application. Urea can be further processed to create other fertilisers. One example is combining urea with ammonium nitrate solution to produce a liquid fertiliser known as Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN). This liquid form offers advantages for certain agricultural applications. It's important to note that excessive use of ammonium-based fertilisers, including anhydrous ammonia and urea, can cause soil acidification. To counteract this effect, applying quicklime (calcium oxide) neutralises the acidity. The added lime also improves soil porosity, promoting better air and water circulation for healthy plant growth. However, the natural world possesses its own amazing system for creating nitrate fertilisers in the soil – the nitrogen cycle (refer to the chapter of soil erosion and conservation of S2 biology). This cycle transforms atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate, a usable nitrogen form by plants, ensuring a continuous supply of this essential nutrient within the ecosystem, promoting plant growth, without relying solely on manufactured fertilisers. Specific conditions favour this process: A neutral soil pH of around 7 provides the optimal environment for nitrifying bacteria, which convert ammonium to nitrate. Moderate soil moisture, around 50% of the soil's water holding capacity, is ideal for these bacteria to function effectively. Warm soil temperatures, around 80°F (26°C), promote the activity of nitrifying bacteria, accelerating the conversion of ammonium to nitrate. Understanding these factors allows farmers to optimise soil conditions for natural nitrate formation and improve nitrogen use efficiency. • In pairs, research on the importance of nitrogen and show in a flow chart how nitrogen from the air is captured and eventually becomes nitrogen in nitrate fertiliser.
