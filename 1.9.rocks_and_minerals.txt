[Assignment 1] {How are igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks formed}. The earth is a rocky planet, compared with, for example, the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, which are mainly composed of gases and liquids. A rock is any naturally occurring solid or aggregate, composed of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Figure338.1.9.rocks_and_minerals_image_001.jpg. Rocks are all around us, and they do a lot for us daily. We sit on them, walk on them, and even use them for fun like building sandcastles. Whether it's supporting our weight or guiding our steps, rocks are a big part of our everyday experiences. But beyond these everyday interactions, rocks are vital for soil formation and crucial for constructing the structures that shape our communities. When rocks breakdown, soil is formed and when we build homes, pave roads, or erect bridges, we rely on massive amounts of rocks to provide stability and strength to these structures. While they might seem common and unexciting, the significance of rocks in our lives and in shaping our infrastructure cannot be underestimated. But how do these rocks really form? Are there secret geological processes behind their creation, or is it just mother nature playing her own version of rock 'n' roll? Rock formation. Rocks form through various geological processes that unfold over extended periods. One common process involves the cooling and solidification of molten rock, known as magma. When magma cools beneath the Earth's surface, it forms intrusive igneous rocks like granite, diorite, and gabbro. These rocks have large mineral crystals due to the slow cooling process. Conversely, when magma erupts onto the Earth's surface as lava and rapidly cools, it forms extrusive igneous rocks such as basalt, obsidian, and pumice. These rocks have smaller mineral crystals due to the rapid cooling rate. Video63.Formation_of_Igneous_Rocks.mp4. Another process involves the weathering of pre-existing rocks, along with the accumulation of organic matter and other debris, which produces sediment. The sediment is then transported and deposited, undergoing compaction and cementation, to eventually harden into sedimentary rocks like sandstone, limestone, shale, conglomerate, and gypsum. These rocks often contain fossils, providing valuable clues about the Earth's history. Metamorphic rocks form from existing igneous and sedimentary rocks undergoing high heat and/or pressure deep within the Earth's crust. This causes them to undergo physical and chemical changes, resulting into rocks like marble, slate and schist. Under such extreme conditions, the minerals within the rock recrystallize and rearrange, resulting in a tightly interlocking crystal structure. This strong and tightly bonded structure gives metamorphic rocks their exceptional hardness and resistance to weathering and erosion. They are the hardest rocks. Overall, rocks are formed through a combination of heat, pressure, erosion, and geological activity, each leaving its mark on the Earth's diverse landscape. The Rock Cycle. Figure339.1.9.rocks_and_minerals_image_002.jpg. The rock cycle is a continuous process where rocks are formed, transformed, and recycled. Igneous rocks, originating from the cooling of magma or lava, are classified as either extrusive or intrusive. Extrusive igneous rocks, like basalt, form from rapidly cooled lava on the Earth's surface, resulting in fine-grained textures. Conversely, intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite, form from slower cooling magma beneath the Earth's surface, leading to coarse-grained textures. Intrusive rocks can become extrusive through uplift. Extrusive igneous rocks can undergo weathering, along with the accumulation of organic matter and other debris, to form sediment. This sediment accumulates and compacts to create sedimentary rocks. Through burial and the application of heat and pressure over time, sedimentary rocks may undergo metamorphism, transforming into metamorphic rocks. Additionally, the application of heat and pressure over time may transform extrusive igneous rocks into metamorphic rocks. Under intense heat within the Earth's crust, metamorphic rocks can melt and become magma. This completes the cycle, as the newly formed magma can then cool and solidify to form intrusive igneous rocks, or erupt onto the Earth's surface as lava, creating extrusive igneous rocks. And so, the cycle continues, repeating over and over again. Driven by geological forces like heat, pressure, and erosion, the rock cycle continuously shapes both the surface and interior of the Earth, over vast stretches of time, spanning millions to billions of years.

What gives them their distinct textures, colours, and strength? The answers lie in the physical properties of rocks. But what exactly are these properties, and why are they that important? Physical properties of rocks. Figure340.1.9.rocks_and_minerals_image_003.jpg. Igneous rocks have different textures depending on how fast magma or lava cools. When it cools quickly, we get fine-grained/smooth textures. But if it cools slower, we get coarse-grained/rough textures. Sedimentary rocks can be clastic (made of fragments) or crystalline. Metamorphic rocks often have either layered (foliated) or unlayered (non-foliated) textures. The colour of rocks varies widely depending on their mineral composition and environmental factors. Basaltic igneous rocks tend to be dark, often appearing black or dark grey due to minerals like olivine and pyroxene. Sedimentary rocks can exhibit a wide range of colours, from sandy beige and earthy brown to vibrant reds, yellows, and greens, depending on the presence of minerals such as quartz, iron oxides, and organic matter. Metamorphic rocks can display an array of colours as well, with shades of grey, black, green, white, and pink commonly seen. These colours are determined by the minerals present and the degree of metamorphism, with intense heat and pressure often resulting in darker, more muted tones, while lighter colours may indicate lower metamorphic grades. Hardness depends on mineral composition, it is commonly acknowledged that quartzite, a metamorphic rock formed from sandstone under intense heat and pressure, is one of the hardest rocks. Granite, an igneous rock, is also renowned for its exceptional hardness compared to many other types of rocks. Sandstone, a sedimentary rock, surpasses the hardness of shale, another sedimentary rock, but it typically falls short of quartzite and granite in terms of hardness. Marble, another metamorphic rock, is relatively softer compared to quartzite, granite, and other hard rocks. Density varies based on minerals and porosity. Porosity is generally low in igneous rocks, variable in sedimentary rocks, and low in metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks exhibit higher densities compared to both sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. Additionally, within the same rock type, variations occur, for instance, basalt is denser than pumice, limestone is denser than sandstone or shale, and slate is denser than schist. Cleavage and fracture patterns differ among rock types: igneous rocks typically fracture, sedimentary rocks may show cleavage or fracture, and metamorphic rocks exhibit cleavage or fracture based on mineral alignment. Strength varies across different types of rocks, with igneous rocks like granite being inherently strong, sedimentary rocks such as sandstone exhibiting durability, and metamorphic rocks like quartzite, displaying exceptional resistance. All the three rock types can exhibit a range of particle sizes, with sedimentary rocks often showing the widest variation due to the diverse depositional environments in which they form. Identification of rock types. Igneous rocks dominate the Earth's crust, constituting approximately 95-98% of its composition, followed by sedimentary rocks at about 2-5%, and metamorphic rocks, which make up less than 1%. Identifying rock types is crucial for understanding geological processes and formations. Each of the 3 main types of rocks has distinct characteristics based on their formation processes, mineral composition, and physical properties. By using a dichotomous key, observers can systematically identify rocks, based mainly on observable traits, facilitating accurate classification. A dichotomous key for identifying rock types is a structured series of paired statements, known as "couplets," that guides the user through a decision-making process, based mainly on observable features. Each step in the key presents a choice between two contrasting characteristics, finally leading to the identification of a specific rock type. The key must be logical, with each subsequent step narrowing down the possibilities until the rock type is conclusively determined. Please refer to your biology notes for more details on how to construct dichotomous keys. • In groups, examine and discuss the general appearance of igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and record characteristics such as colour, patterns, texture, and particle size in a chart. Individually, create a dichotomous key using the information from your observations. [Assignment 3] {Identify some minerals that make up rocks and give their uses}. Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic substances with distinct chemical compositions and crystalline structures. They are the building blocks of rocks, which are aggregates of one or more minerals. They play essential roles in various industries due to their unique physical and chemical properties. From construction materials to electronics, minerals are utilized in countless applications, contributing to the advancement of technology, infrastructure, and everyday life. Igneous rocks commonly contain minerals such as quartz (silicon dioxide), feldspar (aluminium silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), and mica (aluminium silicates of potassium), including biotite and muscovite, along with hornblende (amphibole group), olivine (magnesium iron silicate), and pyroxene (silicate minerals containing magnesium, iron, and calcium). In sedimentary rocks, one typically finds quartz (silicon dioxide) and feldspar (aluminium silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), alongside clay minerals like kaolinite and montmorillonite (aluminium phyllosilicates), as well as calcite (calcium carbonate), dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate), gypsum (calcium sulphate), and halite (sodium chloride). Metamorphic rocks are characterized by quartz (silicon dioxide), feldspar (aluminium silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), and mica (aluminium silicates of potassium), with variations like muscovite and biotite, as well as minerals such as garnet (aluminium silicate), chlorite (aluminium silicate hydroxide), talc (magnesium silicate hydroxide), serpentine (magnesium iron silicate hydroxide), and staurolite (aluminium iron silicate). These common minerals provide distinctive characteristics to each rock type, reflecting their respective origins and geological processes. Mineral Composition of selected rocks (Granite, Sandstone, and Slate): Granite, an igneous rock, is primarily composed of quartz (silicon dioxide), feldspar (aluminium silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), and mica (aluminium silicates of potassium), with additional minerals such as biotite (iron/magnesium-rich mica) and hornblende (amphibole group). Sandstone, a sedimentary rock, predominantly contains quartz (silicon dioxide) and feldspar (aluminium silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), along with lithic fragments (fragments of other rocks) and clay minerals like kaolinite and montmorillonite (aluminium phyllosilicates). Slate, a metamorphic rock, typically contains quartz (silicon dioxide), muscovite (white mica), chlorite (aluminium silicate hydroxide), and feldspar (aluminium silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), along with additional minerals such as pyrite (iron (II) sulphide) and graphite (a carbon allotrope). Conclusively, quartz and feldspar are common minerals found in all the three rock types, highlighting their widespread occurrence in various geological environments. Mica is predominantly found in granite, indicating its association with igneous rocks formed from the crystallization of magma. Lithic fragments are specific to sandstone, reflecting the sedimentary origin of this rock type. Chlorite is a characteristic of slate, indicating its formation under metamorphic conditions involving regional metamorphism. Uses of Minerals found in rocks.

[Assignment 4] {In detail, explain the process of weathering and how weathered rock particles form the basis of soil}. Have you ever wondered how soil, the foundation of terrestrial life, is actually formed? It's a fascinating process that begins with the gradual breakdown of rocks and minerals. This breakdown of parent rocks, known as weathering, is the primary factor driving soil formation. Weathering occurs over several years and takes place in three major ways. 1) Physical/Mechanical weathering: The process of physical weathering, influenced by physical factors such as temperature fluctuations, water, wind, and ice, encompasses a variety of mechanisms that gradually disintegrate rocks and minerals, shaping the Earth's surface over time. a) Temperature. The sun's energy can heat up the rock to very high temperatures, which causes rocks like granite to expand. As temperature falls, the rocks cool down and contract. Alternate heating and cooling of the rocks on exposed mountain sides, causes expansion and contraction which cause the rock to crack and break up. b) Water. Rivers and streams wear away the rocks over which they flow by rolling pebbles and other hard particles on them, depositing mineral-rich sediment along their banks during flooding, which further enriches the soil. c) Sandstorms. When wind blows during sandstorms, it blows sand against bare rocks. d) Frosting. Frost is a weather condition where temperatures fall below 0⁰C, thus water in cracks freezes and expands, causing the rock to break up. 2) Chemical weathering: Chemical weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals are broken down through chemical reactions. This process is primarily driven by environmental factors such as water, air, and acids, which react with minerals in the rocks, causing them to dissolve or undergo chemical transformation. The weathering process, particularly driven by water, especially rainwater, is a common and significant geological phenomenon. As it rains, rainwater dissolves carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to form a weak solution of carbonic acid. This acidic solution can dissolve certain types of rocks, especially those that are more soluble, such as limestone, gypsum, and certain types of sandstone. As these rocks dissolve, mineral elements such as calcium, magnesium, aluminium, and others are released into solution, forming an aqueous mixture enriched with these essential components. When the mineral-rich solution permeates the soil, it deposits these mineral components, enriching the soil with essential nutrients and ions necessary for plant growth. In hot damp conditions (tropics), the rocks especially those containing iron, oxidize very quickly. The oxidized rocks disintegrate to form soil. 3) Biological weathering: This is brought about by the action and presence of living organisms on rocks. Certain organisms such as lichens are able to grow on bare rock while other small flowering plants are able to grow between the rock fragments. When these die, they form humus which is a component of soil. Man contributes to biological weathering through direct splitting of rocks during road and house construction and indirectly through cultivation. There are 5 major factors influencing soil formation: Climate, living organisms, nature of soil parent material, topography of the area and time that the parent rock material is subjected to soil formation. a) Climate. The main climatic factors involved in the soil formation are rainfall, temperature and wind. Rainfall and temperature influence the chemical and physical break down of the parent rock e.g., rainfall promotes weathering of rocks into small particles by leaching of soluble constituent compound in the rock. b) Living organisms. These include the vegetation cover, living microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and invertebrates e.g., earth worms. The vegetation cover influences the characteristics of the soil formed through the litter and root remains which add to the soil. The roots of some plants weaken some rocks, accelerating the weathering process. Lichens, able to grow on bare rock, facilitate physical breakdown as they grow and expand on rock surfaces. Additionally, some lichens contribute to weathering processes by secreting organic acids that dissolve minerals. Organisms like termites, feed on dead vegetation, there by decomposing it. The bi-products of decomposition are added into the soil. c) Parent rock. This influences physical properties and chemical constituents of the soil e.g., granite and sand stones which are rich in mineral content give rise to sand soils, while volcanic larva produces clay soils. d) Topography. This influences the movement of products of weathering which consist of soluble substances and solid soil particles. It affects soil depth and vegetation. Thus, on a steep or rolling topography, there is a tendency for soil erosion to occur, resulting into development of relatively shallow soils. Therefore, topography modifies the effects of climate and vegetation on soil formation. e) Time. The length of time over which soil forming processes have been in action affects the age of the soil. When the soil forming processes have taken place for a long time, one tends to get deep mature soils, provided other factors are constant.
