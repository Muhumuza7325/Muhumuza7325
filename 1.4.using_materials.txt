[Assignment 1] {Classify materials used in everyday life into natural and synthetic groups, and explore how this affects their use in everyday life}. Look around your home or school, you will see different materials with different shapes, colours and uses. A material is a substance or a mixture of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be either pure or impure and can come from living or non-living things. Categories of materials. A material can be Natural or Artificial. A natural material is God made/exists in nature and its formation is not influenced by man, e.g., rocks, sand, water, soil, cotton, reeds, wood, etc. An artificial material is man-made/synthetic, i.e., manufactured by man, e.g., iron bars, steel, plastics, paint, polyethene, composites, etc. Natural materials, sourced from the environment and often renewable, offer sustainability and biodegradability, making them environmentally friendly choices for products such as wood furniture, cotton clothing, and wool bedding. Natural materials also look nice and can be good for our health, like cotton being breathable and not causing allergies. In contrast, synthetic materials, engineered for durability and versatility, provide cost-effectiveness and customization options, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from plastics in electronics to nylon in textiles. Their durability, affordability, and customizability drive their widespread use, though concerns about environmental impact and sustainability persist. Ultimately, the choice between natural and synthetic materials in everyday life depends on factors like cost, availability, performance requirements, and personal preferences, with both types playing crucial roles in modern society. Figure333.1.4.using_materials_image_001.jpg. [Assignment 2] {How do the physical properties of polymers determine uses in everyday life such as in building, as fabrics, fabricating utensils used in homes, etc.,}. The physical properties of materials are influenced by their chemical composition and internal structure, such as crystal arrangement or molecular alignment. Physical properties are measurable characteristics describing a material's state, and tracking changes in them enables one understand how materials behave over time. Choosing the right quality materials for their applications in everyday life, depends on the nature, thus properties of the materials. However, it's important to note that processing methods can significantly alter these properties, highlighting the need for careful consideration and analysis in material selection. There are four main types of materials: metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. Metals are characterized by their strength, ductility, and conductivity, shining and opaque with good electrical and thermal conductance, including iron, aluminium, copper, and gold. Polymers like plastics, rubber, and nylon consist of large molecules made of repeating monomers, lightweight and flexible with diverse properties. Ceramics, formed from inorganic sources such as clay or silica, are recognized for hardness, brittleness, and high-temperature resistance, as seen in pottery, bricks, glass, and porcelain. Composites are made by combining two or more materials with differing properties to bolster strength, stiffness, or durability, exemplified by fiberglass, carbon fibre composites, and reinforced concrete. For instance, materials like metals and ceramics, known for their strength and durability, are commonly employed in construction of durable structures such as bridges and buildings. On the other hand, flexible and elastic materials like certain polymers and composites, find applications in making textiles for clothing and other fabric-based products. These materials have the ability to stretch and bend, allowing them to adjust to the movements of the body. Utensils used in homes are often made from materials with specific thermal properties; ceramics and certain metals are chosen for their ability to withstand high temperatures without deforming. Electrical conductivity is crucial for materials used in electrical wiring and components, making metals like copper and aluminium preferred choices. Additionally, materials with excellent chemical resistance, such as some polymers and ceramics, are essential for plumbing pipes and chemical storage containers. Lightweight materials like polymers and composites are favoured for products such as packaging materials and sports equipment, while those with high water resistance, such as certain plastics and treated fabrics, are used for rainwear and waterproofing coatings. Basically, choosing the right materials for different tasks depends on how well their properties fit the job, ensuring they work well and last a long time. In particular, Cotton, renowned for its excellent absorbency, finds widespread use in textiles. Wood, prized for its hardness and absorbency, serves in building construction, ship/boat building, and furniture making. Paper, opaque and highly absorbent, is utilized in napkins and filter paper production. Plastic, offering flexibility and high tensile strength but poor absorbency, is employed in construction, raincoats, and household equipment. Polyester, with low absorbency, is favoured for tent-making. Wool, known for its elasticity and moderate absorbency, is commonly used in sweater production. Silk, boasting strength, elasticity, and high absorbency, finds applications in textiles, parachutes, and surgical sutures. Nylon, characterized by high tensile strength but poor absorbency, is employed in ropes, raincoats, and filter paper. Polyethene, highly flexible, is utilized in the manufacturing of shopping bags and bottles. Sisal, with moderate tensile strength, is used in rope-making. Rubber, known for its elasticity, is employed in car tyres, rubber bands, and gloves. Glass, with low tensile strength, is commonly used in windows and doors. Polytetrafluoroethylene, offering low tensile strength, finds application in the production of frying pans. Protein, known for its strength and elasticity, is commonly found in textiles and clothing. Starch, appreciated for its biodegradability and versatility, is utilized in packaging materials and food products. Polystyrene, offering lightweight and insulating properties, finds use in construction, packaging, and consumer goods. Video58.Materials_And_Their_Properties.mp4. Video59.Properties_of_Materials.mp4. • In groups, classify samples of natural and synthetic material (wood, paper, natural and synthetic fibres, plastics, cotton, sisal, silk, nylon, wood, polythene, polyester, protein, rubber, starch, wool, polystyrene, Glass and polytetrafluoroethene) on the basis of physical properties such as tensile and compressive strength, flexibility, elasticity, ability to absorb water, etc. Tabulate the observations and identify patterns in your observations. [Assignment 3] {How do molecular structures of materials influence their practical applications}. Most materials exist in a solid state, characterized by orderly arrangements of particles, held together by strong forces of attraction. The tightly packed arrangement of atoms in metals forms a crystalline structure, allowing for high strength, flexibility, and excellent electrical conductivity. This structure facilitates the flow of electrons, making metals indispensable in building infrastructure and manufacturing electrical components like wires and conductors. Polymers consist of long chains of repeating molecular units joined together by weak forces of attraction, and their properties vary based on factors such as chain length, branching, and the presence of functional groups. These variations result into a wide range of properties, including flexibility, chemical resistance, and durability. Plastics, rubber, and fibres are everyday examples of polymer-based materials, each tailored to specific applications like packaging, insulation, and textiles. Ceramics are characterized by a lattice structure held together by strong ionic or covalent bonds. This structure imparts high hardness and resistance to heat, making ceramics suitable for applications requiring abrasion resistance and thermal insulation. Pottery, glass, and advanced ceramic materials find use in diverse fields such as construction, electronics, and aerospace. Composite materials are engineered by combining two or more distinct materials, each contributing its unique properties to the final product. By strategically integrating materials with complementary strengths, composites offer enhanced mechanical properties, such as strength, stiffness, and toughness, surpassing those of individual components. This versatility makes composites ideal for applications ranging from automotive and aerospace structures to sporting equipment and infrastructure. • Individually, research and write a report on the molecular structure of materials and relate the structure of polymers to their use. Building materials. Building materials are any materials used for construction purposes. These include wood, cement, aggregates, metals, bricks, concrete and clay. They are generally classified into two sources; natural and synthetic. Activity 1. General Objective: To determine how varying proportions of sand and cement affect the tensile strength of cement strips. Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in the tensile strength of cement strips made with different proportions of sand and cement. Safety Considerations: Ensure proper ventilation when working with cement. Use appropriate personal protective equipment, such as gloves and goggles, to prevent contact with cement mixtures. Follow all safety guidelines and procedures when operating machinery. Methodology: 1) Preparation of Cardboard Template: Cut a piece of cardboard to size, measuring 12cm x 6cm. Draw lines on the cardboard to create four triangles. Score the cardboard along the drawn lines with a compass needle or scissors. Cut out the four shaded triangles. 2) Construction of Cardboard Boxes: Fold up the sides of the cardboard along the scored lines to form boxes. Secure the corners of the boxes using cellotape. 3) Preparation of Workbench: Cover the workbench with a newspaper and label it with your name and number. 4) Mixing and Casting of Cement Samples: Use one cardboard box as a measure. Mix two measures of cement and two measures of sand in a tin. Gradually add water and mix thoroughly to form a thin paste. Pour the paste into one cardboard box and level the surface. Repeat the process for two more cardboard boxes labelled with your name and numbers 2 and 3; Use one measure of cement and two measures of sand for one set of samples. Use two measures of cement and one measure of sand for the other set of samples. 5) Curing of Cement Samples: Wrap some boxes in polyethene and leave others open to the air. Allow the cement samples to cure for a week. 6) Testing for Tensile Strength: After one week, remove the cured cement samples from the boxes. Test the tensile strength of the three strips of cement. You could measure and record the tensile strength (force required to break) of each cement strip using a tensile strength testing machine, if available. Expected results. The tensile strength of the cement strips is expected to be influenced by both the proportions of cement and sand used in their preparation, as well as the curing conditions employed during the curing process. 1) Effect of proportions of cement and sand: The samples prepared with higher proportions of cement are expected to demonstrate higher tensile strength compared to those with higher proportions of sand. This is due to the stronger bonding and increased cohesion provided by the higher cement content. 2) Influence of curing conditions: Samples cured in polyethene are anticipated to exhibit potentially higher tensile strength compared to those left open to the air. The controlled environment provided by polyethene wrapping may promote more uniform curing, resulting in enhanced cement hydration and stronger bond formation. Conversely, samples left open to the air may experience variations in curing conditions, potentially leading to uneven hydration and weaker bonds, thus affecting their tensile strength. 3) Variation among different sets: Significant differences in tensile strength are expected among the three sets of samples with varying proportions of cement and sand. Specifically, the set with the highest cement-to-sand ratio is anticipated to demonstrate the highest tensile strength, followed by the set with equal proportions of cement and sand, and then the set with the highest sand-to-cement ratio. This trend aligns with the anticipated influence of cement content on the strength properties of the cement strips. Hypothesis Testing: Evaluate the results of the data analysis to determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that there is a significant difference in tensile strength among the different proportions of sand and cement. Conclusions: Based on the results, draw conclusions about the relationship between sand-cement proportions and tensile strength of cement strips. Discuss any implications of the findings for construction practices or material selection. Provide recommendations for optimizing sand-cement ratios in cement strip production. Identify potential areas for further research to deepen understanding or address remaining questions. By following this structured plan and using the scientific method, one can systematically investigate the tensile strengths of cement strips made with different proportions of sand and cement, from hypothesis formulation to conclusions and recommendations. Activity 2. General Objective: To determine the insulating properties of common roofing materials such as tiles, corrugated iron, and thatch. Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in the insulating properties of the common roofing materials. Safety Considerations: Ensure proper handling of materials to prevent injuries. Use appropriate safety gear such as gloves and goggles when handling materials. Follow all safety guidelines and procedures when conducting experiments. Methodology: 1) Selection of Roofing Materials: Choose representative samples of common roofing materials, including tiles, corrugated iron, and thatch. 2) Preparation of Testing Setup: Set up a controlled environment for testing, ensuring consistent temperature and humidity levels. Construct testing apparatus with compartments for placing roofing material samples. 3) Temperature Measurement: Place temperature sensors within each compartment to monitor temperature changes over time. 4) Heating Experiment: Expose the roofing material samples to a controlled heat source, such as a heat lamp or heating pad. Record temperature readings at regular intervals to assess the rate of heat transfer through each material. 5) Cooling Experiment: Remove the heat source and allow the roofing material samples to cool down naturally. Record temperature readings at regular intervals to assess the rate of heat retention or insulation provided by each material. 6) Data Collection and Analysis: Collect temperature data from the sensors for each roofing material sample during both heating and cooling experiments. Analyse the data to determine the rate of heat transfer and heat retention for each material. Expected Results: 1) Comparison of Temperature Changes: It is anticipated that each roofing material will exhibit different temperature changes during the heating and cooling experiments. Materials with higher thermal conductivity, such as corrugated iron, may show rapid temperature increases during heating and quicker cooling rates. Conversely, materials with better insulation properties, such as thatch, may demonstrate slower temperature changes, indicating effective heat retention. 2) Rate of Heat Transfer: The rate of heat transfer through each roofing material is expected to vary, with materials exhibiting higher thermal conductivity allowing for faster heat transfer. Tiles, with their denser structure, may demonstrate slower heat transfer compared to corrugated iron or thatch. 3) Heat Retention Ability: The ability of each roofing material to retain heat after the heat source is removed will also differ. Thicker and more porous materials like thatch may retain heat for longer periods, while thinner and denser materials like corrugated iron may lose heat more rapidly. 4) Overall Insulation Performance: Based on the observed temperature changes and heat transfer rates, conclusions can be drawn regarding the overall insulation performance of each roofing material. Materials with lower temperature changes and slower heat transfer rates are likely to exhibit better insulating properties and thus higher thermal resistance. Hypothesis Testing: Evaluate the results of the data analysis to determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that there is a significant difference in the insulating properties of the tested roofing materials. Conclusions: Based on the results, draw conclusions about the relative insulating properties of the common roofing materials. Discuss any implications of the findings for roofing material selection and energy efficiency in buildings. Provide recommendations for optimizing the thermal performance of roofs based on the research findings. Identify potential areas for further research to deepen understanding or address remaining questions. By following this structured plan and using the scientific method, one can systematically investigate the insulating properties of common roofing materials, from hypothesis formulation to conclusions and recommendations. • In groups, plan and use the scientific method to investigate: a) the tensile strengths of cement strips made with different proportions of sand and cement. b) the insulating properties of common roofing materials such as tiles, corrugated iron and thatch. Physical and molecular structure of building materials. The physical and molecular structure of materials plays a significant role in determining their suitability for building purposes. Strength and Durability: Materials with a strong and durable molecular structure, such as metals and certain ceramics, are highly suitable for building. For example, metal alloys like steel have a crystalline structure with tightly packed atoms held together by metallic bonds, providing excellent strength and durability. Similarly, ceramics with a lattice structure held together by strong ionic or covalent bonds exhibit high hardness and resistance to wear and tear, making them suitable for various building applications. Flexibility and Ductility: Some materials possess a molecular structure that allows for flexibility and ductility, making them ideal for building structures that require deformation resistance. For instance, polymers like certain types of plastics and rubber have long chains of repeating molecular units that offer flexibility and resilience, enabling them to withstand bending and stretching without breaking. This makes them suitable for applications such as insulation, piping, and seals in buildings. Insulating Properties: Materials with molecular structures that impede the flow of heat or electricity are valuable for building insulation and electrical safety. For example, materials like foam insulation and fiberglass have porous molecular structures that trap air pockets, limiting the transfer of heat and providing thermal insulation. Similarly, materials like rubber and certain plastics have high electrical resistance due to their molecular composition, making them suitable for electrical insulation in buildings. Water and Weather Resistance: Building materials with molecular structures that repel water and resist weathering are crucial for maintaining structural integrity and longevity. For instance, certain types of polymers and coatings have molecular structures that are hydrophobic, preventing water penetration and minimizing damage from moisture. Additionally, materials like treated wood and certain metals can withstand exposure to outdoor elements due to their molecular composition, making them suitable for exterior building applications. Weight and Density: The physical structure and density of materials impact their weight-bearing capacity and ease of handling during construction. Materials with low density, such as certain polymers and lightweight aggregates, offer advantages in terms of reduced structural weight and ease of transportation and installation. Conversely, materials with higher density, like concrete and steel, provide greater strength and stability in building structures. Overall, the physical and molecular structure of materials greatly influences their suitability for building applications, dictating properties such as strength, flexibility, insulation, weather resistance, and weight. Understanding these structural characteristics is essential for selecting appropriate materials to meet the specific requirements of building projects while ensuring safety, durability, and efficiency. The suitability of the materials. Figure334.1.4.using_materials_image_002.jpg. Materials to be used for construction have different qualities based on their nature, each offering distinct advantages and disadvantages. Balancing the trade-offs between performance, cost, sustainability, and other factors can help optimize material selection for specific project requirements. A building could be made up of the following: Iron, which is very strong (can support heavy load), has high tensile strength (resists breakage), is ductile and malleable (easy to mould), has high melting point (resists fires), galvanised iron resists rusting and steel has improved properties, making it suitable for many uses. Aluminium has low density (used on top of buildings), strong thus not easy to break/durable, has high melting point (resists fires), has bright appearance (used for doors, roofing, window frames) and has high electrical/heat conductivity (making utensils). Wood is readily available, so easy to get cheaply, strong and so it can support heavy load, light when dry, so good for roofing, easy to smoothen to give nice appearance, and can rot or be eaten by termites when not treated. Mortar, composite made of cement, sand and water, is hard, so resists deformation, is adhesive so can join bricks, and is cushioning to spread the vertical load. Ordinary glass is transparent so good for windows to see through, tinted glass allows light to pass through it in only one direction so good for windows (visual security), double-glazed glass (tampered glass) is strong, resistant to fire attack and it is not brittle, glass is generally reflective, attractive and it adds value when put in doors and windows. Paint, a liquid composite made of pigment, resin, solvent and additives, and weather guard, resists bad weather (water proof), so good for outside walls, silk vinyl paint does not burn, so good for interior purposes, paint can be insect repelling, light sensitive to beautify, and protect walls. Plastics, man-made polymers which can undergo permanent deformation without breaking when subjected to a strong force e.g., PVC, Polyethene, Nylon, and Polyesters are flexible so can be bent easily. They are water prone so are good for Plumbing and roofing. They are light and strong, so good for shuttering purposes. They have low melting points so can be attacked by fires easily. Clay and Ceramics are brittle, so break easily. They are water proof, so good for flooring. They are good looking, so nice for finishing purposes like floors, walls. They cannot be attacked by chemicals. Bricks and blocks are resistant to fire, so good for wall construction. They are strong, so can support heavy loads. The choice of a material for construction is dependent on the purpose it is meant to do and its impact to the environment.

[Assignment 4] {Is it true that polymers are useful long chain molecules made by both natural and synthetic processes}. [Assignment 5] {In shallow depth, explore polymers and how their physical properties determine uses in everyday life such as in building, as fabrics, and fabricating utensils used in homes}. Polymers. The word 'polymer' comes from two Greek words: poly meaning many and 'mer' meaning part/unit. Polymers are useful long chain molecules made by both natural and synthetic processes. Polymers are a special type of macromolecules made of repeating subunits of the same compound. A polymer is a very large molecule with high relative molecular mass formed by the joining of simple molecules called monomers by covalent bonds. Our bodies are naturally built by large protein molecules from small units called amino acids. Our hair, nails, etc., are made of proteins. For very clear reasons, polymers shall be covered in detail in the first chapter in form three, chapter 9 (Carbon in life). Refer to the learning outcomes of this chapter to know which areas to focus on. Video61.The_diverse_world_of_polymers.mp4. Polymerization is the joining together of small molecules of the same compound to form a single large complex molecule. Figure335.1.4.using_materials_image_003.jpg. Types of polymerizations. These are mainly two i.e., addition and condensation. 1) Addition polymerization. This type of polymerization involves the joining together of many small but unsaturated molecules to form a single large molecule. The reaction takes place under high temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. The process involves breaking the carbon double and triple bonds so that the monomers can form bonds with other monomers. No atom or molecule is lost in this process, so the empirical formula of the addition polymer is the same as its monomer. There are two main classes of addition polymers i.e., plastics and rubber. Examples of polymers formed by addition polymerization: Polyethene. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Perspex. Polystyrene. Synthetic rubber. 2) Condensation polymerization: This is the type of polymerization which involves the formation of a single large molecule by the combination of many small molecules with the elimination of a simple molecule like water, hydrogen chloride etc., for each linkage formed, so the empirical formula of the monomer and the polymer are not the same. Examples of polymers formed by condensation. 1) Nylon 6,6. Nylon is a polyamide that has monomers joined together by amide linkages. It is formed from dicarboxylic acids and diamines. The formation of an amide linkage between the carboxyl and amine groups results in the loss of a water molecule. Figure309.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_038.jpg. Figure310.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_039.jpg. 2) Polyesters such as terylene. Terylene is a polyester that has monomers joined together by ester linkages. It is formed from dicarboxylic acids and diols. The formation of an ester linkage between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups results in the loss of a water molecule. Figure311.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_040.jpg. Figure312.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_041.jpg. Terylene is mixed with wool to form terylene wool used for making suits and fishing lines. Note: Nylon and Terylene are both used to make clothing, curtains, fishing lines, parachutes and sleeping bags. 3) Melamine resin. Melamine resin produced by the reaction of melamine with formaldehyde under heat and pressure, is used to make trays, plates and many household utensils. 4) Bakelite. Bakelite formed from the reaction between phenol and formaldehyde, is used to make electric plugs and radio cases. 5) Starch from Glucose, crucial for both plant health and our own energy needs. Types of polymers. Polymers can broadly be divided into two groups, namely: Natural polymers and synthetic polymers. Fibres are polymers which can be drawn into threads. This is because, the forces of attraction between the linear molecules are weak but those between individual atoms are strong. Figure313.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_042.jpg. 1) Natural polymers. Natural polymers are polymers formed by condensation and exist in nature. Examples and their uses. Figure314.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_043.jpg. Wool and silk are natural protein fibres that are used for making clothes. Cotton and wood contain cellulose. Cotton is used for making clothes and wood is used for making paper and furniture. Natural rubber is obtained from rubber trees as a milky liquid called latex. Latex can be coagulated by addition of a little ethanoic acid to form a solid of high molecular weight. The monomer of rubber is isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene). 2) Synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers are man–made polymers. Examples and their uses. 1) Polythene (monomer is ethene) – manufacture of buckets, troughs, watering cans, pipes and bowls. Used as wrapping materials. 2) Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (monomer is Chloroethene, commonly called vinyl chloride) – manufacture of insulating material used in wiring and making of pipes and films, car seat covers, hand bags and suitcase covers. 3) Perspex. The monomer for Perspex, which is a brand name for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), is methyl methacrylate (MMA). Perspex is used for making of wind screens for cars. 4) Nylon (monomer is a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid) - Making of windows and optical instruments, making fabrics, fishing lines and ropes. 5) Polystyrene (monomer is styrene) - making packing materials, making house hold items such as combs, plastic cups and a common lining in refrigerators. 6) Polyester (monomer is ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid) - Apart from its use in electrical wires for insulation, polyester is valued in textiles for its durability and wrinkle resistance. It also finds application in products like window gutters, pipes, and PET bottles due to its strength and cost-effectiveness, highlighting its versatility in manufacturing and construction. 7) Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (monomer is tetrafluoroethylene). PTFE is commonly known as Teflon. It is prized for its non-stick properties, chemical resistance, and high heat tolerance. It finds applications in cookware coatings, industrial seals and bearings, electrical insulation, medical devices, and sealing solutions across various industries. All synthetic polymers are plastic in nature and hence plastics. Plastics are a group of materials produced from naturally occurring raw materials such as coal, petroleum and Silica. They are just minor products formed by cracking of crude oil. Video57.A_brief_history_of_plastic.mp4. Types of plastics. Plastics can be put into two types depending on their behaviour upon heating i.e., thermo-softening plastics and thermo-setting plastics. 1) Thermo-softening (thermoplastics). Thermo-softening plastics are plastics which soften or melt when heated and harden when cooled. Because they soften on warming, they can be moulded into different shapes. Structure of thermo-plastics. Figure315.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_044.jpg. The long polymer chains in thermoplastics lie alongside each other. They may be entwined on each other but the polymer chains are not linked (not bonded to each other). When heated, the chains slide over each other making them soft and runny. Examples of thermoplastics include: Polythene, Nylon, Perspex, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or Polychloroethene and Polypropene. Video62.Thermosetting_and_Thermosoftening_Polymers.mp4. Polythene. a) There are two common types of polythene i.e., low-density polyethene and high-density polythene. i) Low density polythene. This is made by polymerizing ethene at a high pressure of 1000-2000 atmospheres and temperature of 200˚C. White waxy solid polyethene forms. Oxygen is used as a catalyst. It has a lower softening temperature of 105˚C-120˚C. The low density is due to poor packing of the branched polymer chains. The low-density polythene is soft, light and flexible. Uses: For making polythene bags; insulation of electric cables because they can withstand bad weather conditions; making of squeeze bottles such as wash bottles; making plastic bags; and as a film in solar heaters and driers instead of glass. Disadvantage: At boiling water temperature, these polymers become soft, so much that they become flappy and lose shape. ii) High density polythene. It is made by polymerizing ethene at low pressure (5-25 atmospheres) and low temperature (20-50˚C) in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst. It has a higher softening temperature of about 140˚C. The high density is due to the close packing of the unbranched polymer chains. Very few of these polymers may be branched. They are much harder and stiff and do not lose shape at boiling water temperature. Uses. For making crates e.g., of beer and sodas, bowls, toys, buckets, food boxes, etc. Figure316.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_045.jpg. Figure317.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_046.jpg. Where ₙ = about 600. Properties of polyethene. It is a white waxy solid. It is less dense than water. It is tough and insoluble in all solvents at room temperature. It is a good electrical insulator. It does not rot, corrode or react with common chemicals. b) PVC is made by polymerization of vinyl chloride (chloroethene). PVC are more rigid than polyethene and are used for making water pipes, light switches and sockets, insulation for electric cables, carpets, plastic rain coats, etc. c) Polypropene. This is made by polymerizing propene at a high pressure in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst. It is used for making ropes and for packaging. 2) Thermosetting plastics (thermosets). These are plastics which do not soften or melt on heating and therefore cannot be remoulded into different shapes once they are set. They simply decompose upon heating. Thermosetting plastics have polymer chains which are bonded/linked to each other. This is called cross linking. Figure318.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_047.jpg. They are rigid, hard and brittle. Heating has no effect until a temperature high enough to break some of the cross-links is reached, decomposing the plastic. There are cross-linking agents that convert thermoplastics into thermosetting plastics, for example, sulphur in vulcanisation of rubber. Examples of thermosetting plastics include: Bakelite (used for making electric plugs, sauce pan handler, switches), melamine (used for making cups and children dishes) and vulcanized/commercial rubber. Vulcanisation of natural rubber. Rubber in its natural state is not strong or elastic enough for its intended uses and it is made stronger and more useful by vulcanization. Vulcanization of rubber is the process by which rubber is heated with sulphur at about 140⁰C. The sulphur atoms add to a few double bonds in rubber to form cross linkages between the polymeric natural rubber chains which can no longer slide over each other easily, making rubber hard. In such a case, sulphur acts as a cross-linking agent. Figure319.3.1.carbon_in_life_image_048.jpg. Importance of vulcanization. Vulcanization makes rubber stronger, more elastic, more durable and heat resistant. Uses of vulcanized rubber. Making of toys. Making of car tyres and tyre inner tubes. Making of shoes. Making of gumboots. Advantages and disadvantages of synthetic polymers over Natural polymers. Advantages. They are cheap and attractive. Relatively low production cost compared to the cost of extracting natural polymers. Light and portable. They are usually stronger, resistant to acids and alkalis and corrosion resistant. They can easily be shaped and moulded (they are ductile). They are good thermal and electrical insulators. Plastics can be coloured when they are being manufactured and they do not need repainting. Disadvantages. They pollute the environment as they produce highly poisonous fumes when they burn. Some cannot be broken down by bacteria and other organisms (non-biodegradable). Where serious fire hazards occur, molten plastics can inflict very severe burn. Video47.Natural_and_synthetic_polymers.mp4. [Assignment 6] {How do common materials pollute the environment and which materials can be recycled}. In summary, common materials like plastics, metals, and paper can pollute the environment through various means. Plastics, for instance, persist in the environment for hundreds of years, releasing harmful chemicals and microplastics into ecosystems, threatening wildlife and marine life. Metal pollution can occur through mining activities and industrial processes, leading to soil and water contamination. Paper production contributes to deforestation, habitat loss, and water pollution from chemical runoff. Mitigating environmental pollution involves a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, reuse, recycle, recovery, and responsible disposal. Prevention strategies focus on minimising pollution at the source, through cleaner production processes and sustainable practices. Reuse initiatives promote the extended use of products and materials to reduce waste generation. Recovery methods, such as composting and material recovery facilities, extract valuable resources from waste streams for reuse or energy production. Proper disposal ensures that waste is managed in a way that minimises environmental impact, whether through landfill management or advanced incineration technologies. Recycling in particular, offers a solution to mitigate environmental pollution by diverting materials from landfills and reducing the demand for virgin resources. Materials like paper, cardboard, glass, aluminium, and certain types of plastics (such as PET and HDPE) are commonly recycled. Recycling these materials conserves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and minimizes the extraction of raw materials. Additionally, advancements in recycling technologies continue to expand the range of materials that can be recycled, offering opportunities for more sustainable waste management practices. By implementing these strategies collectively, societies can to a larger extent, address environmental pollution and move towards a more sustainable future. Note that burning plastics to reduce waste is a common practice, but it poses serious health and environmental risks. The process releases harmful gases that can cause immediate respiratory issues and long-term health problems like cancer. Additionally, it contributes to air pollution and ozone layer depletion, similar to burning fossil fuels, as plastics are derived from fossil fuels. This worsens environmental damage and climate change. Finding alternatives to burning plastics is crucial to avoid these harmful consequences.

Record results in a table, and use prior learning to label them according to: a) their molecular structure, and b) whether they are natural or synthetic. • Individually, carry out research and write reports on ways to: • dispose of materials using appropriate methods to guard against polluting the environment. • identify which of the following materials can be recycled: paper, ink cartridges, plastic plates, old TVs, clay pots, light bulbs, broken glass, fabrics/textiles/clothing etc. [Assignment 7] {Explore the effect of heating on the structure and properties of some materials}. Heating profoundly alters material structure and properties, crucial for various applications. Materials, from polymers to ceramics, respond differently to heat, affecting strength, flexibility, and thermal stability. Understanding these effects is vital for manufacturing optimization, product performance, and innovation. Heating metals causes expansion, alters mechanical properties, and can lead to structural changes like melting. Heating and sudden cooling (quenching) of the metal, makes it harder by altering its internal structure. Controlled heating methods, like annealing, relieve internal stresses and enhance malleability and ductility, allowing for easier shaping, while overheating can lead to detrimental effects, such as grain growth, loss of strength, and even material degradation. Thus, precise temperature control is vital in metalworking to achieve desired properties. Heating polyethylene/polyethene can lead to softening and melting, allowing it to be moulded into different shapes. However, excessive heat can cause degradation, leading to reduced mechanical strength and increased brittleness. Polyester can withstand moderate heat without significant structural changes. However, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause melting or thermal degradation, affecting its mechanical properties and appearance. Heating cellulose-based materials like paper can cause dehydration and thermal degradation, leading to yellowing, brittleness, and loss of strength. Melamine resins, commonly used in dishware, can withstand high temperatures without melting. However, prolonged exposure to heat can cause discoloration, warping, and even release of toxic fumes if heated excessively. Heating glass can cause expansion and softening, making it malleable for shaping. However, rapid cooling after heating can induce internal stresses, leading to cracking or shattering. Plastic plates can deform or melt when exposed to high temperatures, depending on the type of plastic used. Heat-resistant plastics like polycarbonate may withstand higher temperatures compared to other plastics like polystyrene. Please revisit the two types of plastics i.e., thermo-softening plastics and thermo-setting plastics, to get details on the effect of heat on synthetic polymers. In summary, while heating can be used to shape and manipulate certain materials, it can also lead to undesirable changes in their structure and properties, including melting, degradation, discoloration, and loss of strength. Therefore, it is essential to consider the specific characteristics of each material and the intended application when subjecting them to heat;
