THEME: GEOMETRY AND MEASURES
TOPIC 1: GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION SKILLS 12 PERIODS
Competency: The learner uses the angle properties of lines and shapes to solve problems;

LEARNING OUTCOMES SUGGESTED LEARNING ACTIVITIES SAMPLE ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
The learner should be able to:
a) draw perpendicular and parallel
lines. (k, s)
b) construct perpendiculars, angle
bisectors, mediators and parallel
lines. (u, s)
c) use a pair of compasses and a ruler
to construct special angles. (60 0, 45 0)
(u, s)
d) describe a locus. (u)
e) relate parallel lines, perpendicular
bisector, angle bisector, straight
line and a circle as loci. (k, u)
f) draw polygons. (u)
g) measure lengths and angles. (s)
h) construct geometrical figures
such as triangle, square,
rectangle, rhombus,
parallelogram. (u, s, v/a)
• Learners should identify perpendicular and
parallel lines in the environment
• Outside learners use strings and markers
to create various loci e.g. equidistant
from a fixed point (circle); equidistant
from
two fixed points (perpendicular bisector);
equidistant from a line (parallel lines);
equidistant from a fixed point and a line
(parabola); the sum of the distance from two
fixed points is a constant (ellipse)
• Construct various polygons and geometric
designs using geometric equipment


• In your exercise book, construct the
following angles by using a pair of
compasses, ruler and pencil only;

a) 30 0 f) 15 0
b) 45 0 g) 105 0
c) 60 0 h) 135 0
d) 75 0 i) 180 0
e) 90 0 j) 22.5 0
a) Accurately construct a square
b) Accurately construct a regular hexagon
