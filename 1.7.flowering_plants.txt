Assignment 1 {Explore the external parts of a typical flowering plant}. Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, are classified under the phylum Anthophyta, also known as Magnoliophyta which is further divided into two major clades: Monocotyledonae (monocots) and Eudicotyledonae (eudicots). These clades represent distinct evolutionary lineages that exhibit notable differences in structure and function (refer to Topic 1.3.2, The five kingdoms of living organisms). A typical flowering plant is a highly organised organism with three main organs—roots, stems, and leaves—that work together through distinct systems, which can be broadly divided into the root system and the shoot system, to support growth, reproduction, and survival. The root system, which develops below the ground, anchors the plant and absorbs water and essential minerals from the soil. It consists of either a taproot system, with a central thick primary root growing deep into the soil and secondary lateral roots branching out, common in dicots like carrots, or a fibrous root system, which lacks a main root, with all the many, thin adventitious roots originating from the base of the stem, spreading horizontally near the soil surface, typical of monocots such as wheat. The tap root system of dicots allows them to access water and nutrients from deeper soil layers, providing a competitive advantage in drought conditions. In contrast, the fibrous root system of monocots maximises the surface area for water and nutrient absorption, allowing for efficient uptake in nutrient-poor soils and provides excellent anchorage, enhancing stability and soil-binding capacity in shallow ground. The shoot system, which is above ground, includes the stem, leaves, flowers, and fruits. The primary functions of the stem include providing structural support, holding leaves in optimal positions for sunlight absorption necessary for photosynthesis, acting as a conduit for the transport of water, nutrients, and sugars between the roots and leaves via vascular tissues—the xylem and phloem, positioning flowers and fruits for effective pollination or dispersal, carrying out photosynthesis when young, and facilitating gaseous exchange through lenticels (pores). Monocot stems generally lack secondary growth due to the absence of a vascular cambium and have scattered vascular bundles throughout the stem. In contrast, dicot stems typically have vascular bundles arranged in a ring, with the potential for secondary growth leading to stem thickening and the formation of woody tissues. This distinction is part of the broader diversity seen in flowering plants, which can be either herbaceous or woody. Herbaceous angiosperms, which include many monocots such as grasses and lilies, as well as dicots like daisies and clovers, lack significant secondary growth and are generally soft-stemmed. These plants are well-suited to environments where rapid growth and reproduction are advantageous, such as grasslands, meadows, and agricultural fields. Woody angiosperms, found predominantly among dicots, include trees like oaks and shrubs like roses. These plants develop durable, lignified secondary growth, enabling them to persist for many years, achieve substantial size, and dominate stable environments such as forests and woodlands. Leaves, the primary site of photosynthesis, capture sunlight and exchange gases through stomata, enabling the synthesis of glucose. Their arrangement, shape, and venation differ between monocots and dicots, influencing efficiency in light capture and water conservation. The leaves of monocots are usually long, narrow, and typically exhibit parallel venation, efficient in maximising light capture in open environments, such as grasslands, whereas dicot leaves are broader with a wider range of shapes and sizes, and typically display reticulate venation, with a network of interconnected veins, excelling at capturing light in diverse habitats. In terms of attachment, monocot leaves are commonly sessile, directly connected to the stem, while dicot leaves are often petiolate, joined by a stalk-like petiole. Flowers are specialised reproductive organs in which all events of a plant’s sexual reproduction occur, leading to the formation of an embryo located in the seed. They are often adapted for pollination by wind, insects, or other animals. Floral structures in monocots are characterised by parts arranged in multiples of three, while in dicots, floral parts occur in multiples of four or five. Monocot flowers tend to have simpler forms, although they can be brightly coloured and highly specialised for pollination, while dicot flowers exhibit greater variety in size, structure, and colouration, attracting diverse pollinators. After successful fertilisation, flowers develop into fruits that protect seeds and aid in their dispersal. Together, the root and shoot systems form an integrated network that allows flowering plants to efficiently utilise resources. This integration of root and shoot systems, coupled with the diversity of structural forms and adaptations, underscores the versatility and resilience of angiosperms, enabling them to thrive across nearly every terrestrial ecosystem, from alpine tundra to tropical rainforests. Figure237.1.7.flowering_plants_image_001.jpg. • In pairs, draw and label the parts of a whole mature dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant. • In groups, compare the structural features (root system, leaf venation, leaf shape, leaf attachment to stem, and flower colour) of a whole herbaceous dicotyledonous plant and whole monocotyledonous plant. Record your observations and present them to the class. In botany, a root is the usually underground part of a vascular plant that develops from the radicle of the embryo during germination. There are three main kinds of roots: primary roots, which are the first roots to grow out of a seed as an extension of the radicle; secondary roots, which grow laterally from the primary roots; and adventitious roots, generally of similar size, which arise from the stems or leaves rather than as branches from primary or secondary roots. In addition to these root types, many plants exhibit modified roots that serve specialised functions. These include storage roots (root tubers), which are thick, fleshy, and succulent, containing stored food like sugar and starch (e.g., carrots, cassava, and sweet potato) for energy; pneumatophores or aerial roots, also known as breathing roots, found in swampy areas (e.g., white mangrove), that extend above the water surface, enabling gas exchange in waterlogged environments; stilt roots, which develop from the main stem in plants like red mangrove, to provide additional support; prop roots, which emerge from nodes close to the soil surface in plants like maize and sugarcane, and grow down into the soil to provide additional support, enhancing stability in windy conditions; buttress roots, large thick roots that anchor certain trees (e.g., Mvule trees) firmly in the soil; clasping roots, which grow from the nodes of climbing plants like figs and secrete a sticky substance for support; epiphytic roots, which hang freely in the atmosphere to absorb moisture, allowing epiphytic plants to grow on other plants; and sucking roots, found in parasitic plants like figs that penetrate host plants to absorb water, mineral salts, and organic compounds. Additionally, some roots form symbiotic relationships, such as mycorrhizal roots, where fungi associate with plant roots, enhancing nutrient absorption (especially phosphorus) and providing the fungi with carbohydrates, or root nodules, where bacteria like Rhizobium inhabit the roots of legumes, converting atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for the plant. These modifications showcase the remarkable adaptability of roots, allowing plants to thrive in diverse habitats and conditions while fulfilling essential physiological roles. In botany, a stem is the main axis of a plant that bears buds and shoots with leaves, typically growing upwards away from the roots. Stems may also support flowers and fruits, playing a vital role in the plant's growth and reproductive processes. The structure of a stem includes nodes, which are points where leaves and buds are attached; internodes, the segments of the stem between the nodes; axillary buds located in the axils (the angles between the leaf and the stem) that have the potential to develop into branches, flowers, or additional leaves, allowing for the plant to expand its structure and enhance its reproductive success; and the terminal bud found at the tip of the stem that promotes upward growth and the elongation of the stem. Stems can be classified into erect stems, which can support themselves in an upright position (including woody stems found in shrubs and trees and herbaceous stems in plants like tomatoes and rice); weak stems, which cannot support themselves and either creep or climb for support; and modified underground stems, which remain permanently buried and primarily serve as food and water storage organs, supporting the plant's survival and growth in various conditions. These modified underground stems are also known as perennating organs because they enable the plant to perennate, or survive adverse conditions such as drought, extreme cold, or seasonal dormancy, by storing essential nutrients and water, ensuring regrowth when favourable conditions return. They include rhizomes, which are horizontal, thick, and produce adventitious roots and terminal buds for vegetative propagation (e.g., ginger, turmeric, and ferns), stem tubers that are swollen underground storage stems rich in nutrients (e.g., Irish potato and yams), bulbs that are underground structures consisting of fleshy, modified leaves that encase a central shoot (e.g., onions, garlic, and tulips), and corms that are swollen, fleshy, and round underground stems that grow vertically with randomly distributed roots (e.g., taro, crocus, and gladiolus). Additionally, twining stems, such as those of morning glory and yam, spiral around a support for climbing, while creeping stems, found in plants like pumpkin, mint, strawberries, creeping buttercup, and couch grass, grow horizontally along or just below the soil surface, rooting at nodes to spread and establish new plants. Stolons are a specialised type of creeping stem that extend outward from the parent plant, often above or just beneath the soil, producing new shoots and roots at their nodes. Runners, a specific form of stolon, grow extensively along the soil surface, forming dense mats. Bananas, pineapples, and chrysanthemums develop suckers, which are shoots arising from the base of the stem or roots of the parent plant. Sugarcane, roses, hibiscus, and cassava reproduce through the nodes on their stems. Furthermore, some stems have evolved specialised adaptations, such as tendrils for climbing (e.g., grapes and peas), thorns for defence (e.g., roses), and spines or prickles for protection against herbivores. Assignment 2 {How do the structures of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits suit their functions}. The structures of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits are intricately adapted to their respective functions, with various types and modifications tailored to specific ecological roles. Both dicot and monocot roots possess an epidermis, the outermost layer of cells, which typically lacks a cuticle. In regions of active water and nutrient absorption, the epidermis develops a piliferous layer, characterised by the presence of root hairs that significantly enhance the absorptive capacity of the root. The endodermis, the innermost layer of the cortex, a single layer of tightly packed cells with Casparian strips, regulates the selective absorption of water and minerals. Beneath the epidermis lies the cortex, composed of parenchymatous cells (providing some support to the root) with intercellular spaces that serve functions such as storage, water conduction, and gaseous exchange. The endodermis, the innermost layer of the cortex, consists of a single layer of tightly packed cells with Casparian strips. These strips, impregnated with suberin (a waxy, hydrophobic substance), regulate the selective absorption of water and minerals, blocking the passive flow of substances into the vascular tissue and ensuring controlled transport. The pericycle, located just inside the endodermis, is a thin layer of cells that gives rise to lateral roots in both dicots and monocots. A notable feature present in both dicot and monocot roots is the root cap, which protects the growing tip of the root as it pushes through the soil. The root cap also secretes mucilage to facilitate movement through the soil, helping to reduce friction. However, the vascular cylinder (stele) composed of xylem, phloem, pericycle, endodermis, and pith in monocot roots exhibits clear differences. In mature dicot roots, the xylem forms a star-shaped structure at the centre, typically consisting of 2–6 radiating arms, while the phloem is situated between these arms. The pith is either absent or very small, and secondary growth occurs due to the formation of vascular cambium, which produces additional xylem and phloem. This secondary growth enhances the root's ability to access resources over time, making dicots well-suited for stable, deep-rooted growth. In contrast, mature monocot roots feature a ring-like arrangement of xylem and phloem, characterised by numerous vascular bundles (a polyarch condition), with a well-developed pith, primarily composed of parenchyma cells, occupying the central region. The pith serves primarily as a storage tissue for carbohydrates and nutrients, which can be utilised during periods of growth or stress. It also aids in the transport of nutrients and water within the root, enhancing the overall efficiency of the root system. Additionally, the pith provides structural support, helping to maintain the integrity of the root as it grows and anchors into the soil. However, secondary growth is absent due to the lack of vascular cambium, which limits their ability to increase root girth over time. Consequently, monocots are particularly efficient in shallow, unstable environments where rapid anchorage and nutrient uptake are essential. Figure238.1.7.flowering_plants_image_002.jpg. Both dicot and monocot stems possess an epidermis, the outermost protective layer, typically covered with a cuticle to reduce water loss. The epidermis may also contain stomata for gaseous exchange and trichomes for protection. Beneath the epidermis lies the cortex, composed mainly of parenchyma cells for storage, mechanical support, and often containing chloroplasts, which can contribute to photosynthesis (in green stems). In some cases, the cortex may include collenchyma cells that provide additional strength and flexibility to the stem. In dicot stems, the cortex is typically well-developed, while in monocots, it may be reduced or absent. The innermost layer of the cortex is the endodermis, though it is often less distinct in stems compared to roots. The vascular bundles are arranged in a ring surrounding a central pith in dicot stems, forming a distinct vascular cylinder. The central pith, primarily made up of parenchyma cells, functions in storage and sometimes in water transport. The xylem is positioned towards the inner side of the bundle, while the phloem faces outward. This arrangement allows for significant secondary growth, with the development of a vascular cambium between the xylem and phloem. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem (wood) internally and secondary phloem (bark) externally, leading to an increase in stem girth, enhancing long-term structural support and enabling dicot stems to grow tall and sturdy. Surrounding the vascular bundle, sclerenchyma cells provide additional mechanical strength, contributing to the overall rigidity and resilience of the stem. In contrast, monocot stems exhibit a unique arrangement of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a bundle sheath, within a homogenous ground tissue that is primarily composed of parenchyma cells. This structure, lacking a distinct cortex and pith, enhances flexibility and resistance to bending, making monocot stems particularly well-adapted to withstand the forces of wind and other environmental challenges. The absence of a well-defined vascular cylinder and the lack of vascular cambium prevent significant secondary growth, which is compensated for by the presence of supportive sclerenchyma cells around the vascular bundles, providing essential mechanical support. This structural divergence results in the characteristic slender, herbaceous appearance of monocot stems, contrasting with the typically robust, woody appearance of dicot stems due to secondary growth. Monocot stems are thus better suited for rapid growth and flexibility in open, dynamic environments. Figure239.1.7.flowering_plants_image_003.jpg. Both dicot and monocot leaves possess an epidermis, the outermost layer, which is typically covered with a waxy cuticle to minimise water loss. In many species, the epidermis is further protected by trichomes (leaf hairs). Modifications like tendrils in peas (Pisum sativum, a dicot) and spines in cacti (Cactaceae), adapt leaves for climbing and water conservation, respectively. In dicots, stomata, specialised pores that regulate gas exchange and transpiration, are predominantly found on the lower surface of the leaf, while in monocots, they are evenly distributed on both surfaces. Guard cells surrounding the stomata regulate their opening and closing, controlling water loss and gas exchange. Beneath the epidermis lies the mesophyll, the primary site of photosynthesis. In dicot leaves, the mesophyll is typically differentiated into two distinct layers: the palisade mesophyll, composed of columnar cells with numerous chloroplasts, and the spongy mesophyll, consisting of irregularly shaped cells with large air spaces that facilitate gas exchange. In contrast, monocot leaves typically have a more uniform mesophyll structure, consisting of uniformly distributed parenchyma cells with chloroplasts, lacking a clear distinction between palisade and spongy layers. This simpler arrangement reflects the adaptations of monocots, such as grasses, to open, windy environments where efficient photosynthesis and gas exchange are crucial. The vascular bundles, forming the veins of the leaf, exhibit distinct arrangements in dicots and monocots. In dicot leaves, the veins typically form a reticulate (net-like) pattern, with a prominent midrib and smaller veins branching throughout the leaf blade. This arrangement provides structural support for the larger, broader leaves of many dicots and efficient transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates across the leaf. In monocot leaves, the veins are arranged in a parallel pattern, running longitudinally from the base to the tip of the leaf. This arrangement contributes to the leaf's flexibility and strength, especially in windy environments. In both types, the vascular bundles are surrounded by bundle sheath cells, which play a role in protecting the veins and, in some monocots, contribute to C4 photosynthesis by compartmentalising enzymatic activities. A notable feature of monocot leaves is the presence of bulliform cells, large, specialised epidermal cells on the upper surface of the leaf. These cells help in rolling and unrolling the leaf during water stress, reducing water loss. In dicot leaves, such cells are absent, but the broader lamina (the flat, expanded part of a leaf) and reticulate venation allow efficient photosynthesis and support in various environmental conditions. Both dicots and monocots have flowers as reproductive organs, composed of four main whorls (circular layers of specialised tissues): calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. The various structures of a flower play critical roles in the processes of pollination, fertilisation, fruit, and seed development. The calyx, the outermost whorl, consists of green, leaf-like structures called sepals that protect the developing flower bud. The corolla, the next whorl, is composed of petals that are often scented and brightly coloured to attract pollinators. When sepals are free, the flower is polysepalous; when fused, it is gamosepalous. Similarly, petals may appear fused (gamopetalous) or resemble sepals in texture and colour (sepaloid), or sepals may resemble petals (petaloid). Together, the calyx and corolla form the perianth, which may be distinct (as in dicots) or undifferentiated into tepals (as in some monocots). Grass and male maize flowers, like many other grasses, exhibit a unique floral arrangement. They grow in groups called spikelets along the same axis, typically the stem or branch of the plant. Each spikelet typically comprises a short axis bearing two basal bracts known as glumes, followed by one or more florets. A floret is a single flower lacking petals and sepals, instead possessing green, leaf-like structures for protection. These include the lemma, the larger outer bract, and the palea, the smaller inner bract. These bracts not only protect the flower but also play a crucial role in seed dispersal, such as by aiding in wind dispersal or attaching to animals. Note that bracts are a versatile plant structure, often found near the base of a flower or an inflorescence (a cluster of flowers), that can be present in various combinations with other floral parts, including petals and sepals. The androecium, consisting of one or more stamens, and the gynoecium, made up of one or more carpels, are the male and female reproductive organs, respectively. Each stamen comprises a filament and an anther, which contains pollen sacs responsible for producing pollen grains that house the male gametes. A staminode is a sterile or non-functional stamen. Each carpel comprises three main structures: the stigma, which is the sticky surface that receives pollen; the style, a slender structure that connects the stigma to the ovary; and the ovary, which encloses the ovules containing the female gametes. The pistil, usually located in the centre of the flower, is the complete female reproductive organ of a flower, made up of one or more carpels. When a pistil has a single carpel, it is referred to as monocarpous. In contrast, a syncarpous pistil is formed from multiple fused carpels, while an apocarpous pistil consists of multiple separate carpels. A complete flower contains all four floral whorls: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, whereas an incomplete flower lacks one or more of these floral parts. A perfect flower has both male (stamens) and female (carpels) reproductive organs, while an imperfect flower has only one of these structures, making it unisexual. Unisexual flowers can be staminate (bearing stamens but no carpels) or pistillate/carpellate (bearing carpels but no stamens). A bisexual (hermaphrodite or androgynous) flower contains both stamens and carpels within the same structure. Monoecious plants bear both male and female flowers on the same individual, while dioecious plants have male and female flowers on separate individuals. Dichogamy refers to the temporal separation of male and female reproductive phases in a flower to prevent self-pollination. In protandry, stamens mature before carpels, whereas in protogyny, carpels mature before stamens. A regular (actinomorphic) flower has radial symmetry (it can be divided into equal halves along multiple planes passing through the centre), while an irregular (zygomorphic) flower exhibits bilateral symmetry (it can be divided into equal halves along only one specific plane). The peduncle is the stalk of a flower or an inflorescence, while the pedicel refers specifically to the stalk of an individual flower in an inflorescence. Inflorescence describes the arrangement of flowers on a plant’s stem or branches, which can be classified into racemose (indeterminate) or cymose (determinate) types. The floral axis, also known as the receptacle, is the thickened upper part of the pedicel where the flower is attached, supporting the flower and holding the floral whorls. Depending on its position, the ovary sits above or below the other floral parts (like petals and sepals). A hypogynous flower has the ovary superior (above the other floral parts), while in epigynous flowers, the ovary is inferior (below the other floral parts), and in perigynous flowers, the ovary is semi-inferior (partially below the other floral parts, essentially sitting at a mid-level position). Nectaries are specialised glands located on the receptacle or within various floral organs, that produce nectar to attract pollinators. When pollen grains adhere to the stigma, they germinate and form a pollen tube that extends down through the style. This pollen tube transports the male gametes to the ovule within the ovary, allowing fertilisation to occur when a male gamete fuses with the female gamete (egg) inside the ovule. Figure240.1.7.flowering_plants_image_004.jpg. However, the arrangement of these floral organs differs significantly between dicots and monocots. In dicots, floral parts are typically arranged in multiples of four or five (e.g., four sepals, four petals, four stamens, four carpels). This is often referred to as tetramerous or pentamerous symmetry. In contrast, monocot flowers usually exhibit trimerous symmetry, with floral parts arranged in multiples of three (e.g., three sepals, three petals, three stamens, three carpels). This difference in floral symmetry is a crucial characteristic used to distinguish dicots from monocots. The arrangement of vascular tissue within the floral organs also varies. In dicot flowers, the vascular bundles within the pedicel and floral organs are arranged in a ring, reflecting the organisation seen in their stems. Monocot flowers, on the other hand, exhibit scattered vascular bundles, similar to their stems. In terms of symmetry, dicot flowers often exhibit radial (actinomorphic) or bilateral (zygomorphic) symmetry, allowing adaptation to diverse pollination mechanisms. Monocot flowers typically display radial symmetry, which is suited for generalist pollinators. The ovary structure also shows differences. In dicots, the ovary may be superior or inferior and typically contains a variable number of ovules depending on the species. In monocots, the ovary is often superior, and the number of ovules is frequently consistent with their simpler floral organisation. The style and stigma, which facilitate pollen reception and fertilisation, are also generally simpler in monocots compared to the more diverse forms seen in dicots. Pollination mechanisms differ between the groups, reflecting their ecological adaptations. Dicot flowers, with their larger, often brightly coloured petals and diverse shapes, are commonly adapted for biotic pollination by insects, birds, or mammals. Monocot flowers, with their simpler structure and frequent production of wind-dispersed pollen, are often adapted for abiotic pollination, though some, like orchids, exhibit intricate adaptations for specific pollinators. Dicot and monocot fruits and seeds exhibit significant differences in their structural organisation, although they share a common origin. Following fertilisation, the ovule develops into a seed, while the surrounding ovary transforms into a fruit. A seed is primarily a fertilised ovule, containing the plant embryo and a supply of stored nutrients, encased in a seed coat, a protective outer layer that safeguards the inner structures from environmental hazards, pathogens, and predators. The seed coat can vary in texture and thickness, and a seed often feature unique markings, such as a hilum (a scar or mark left on a seed coat by the former attachment to the ovary wall or to the funiculus that in turn attaches to the ovary wall) and a micropyle (the small opening that allows water to enter the seed during germination). On a bean seed, the hilum is called the "eye". Seeds can vary greatly in size, shape, and texture, depending on the plant species. Dicot seeds typically contain two cotyledons (seed leaves that provide nourishment) and possess a larger reserve of nutrients, which supports the embryo, the nascent plant, during germination and early growth. In contrast, monocot seeds contain a single cotyledon and often rely on the endosperm as a nutrient source to support the embryo during germination. As the seed matures, it undergoes physiological changes that prepare it for dormancy until conditions are favourable for germination, ensuring the successful propagation of the species. In contrast, a fruit is the mature ovary of a flower, often encompassing one or more seeds. It develops after fertilisation and serves to protect the seeds as well as aid in their dispersal. However, in some plants such as bananas and pineapples, the fruits develop without fertilisation, a process known as parthenocarpy. Parthenocarpic fruits are typically seedless, as no fertilisation occurs to form seeds within the ovary. This phenomenon can occur naturally or be induced artificially through the application of plant hormones such as auxins or gibberellins. Therefore, parthenocarpy is the development of fruits without fertilisation, offering advantages such as the production of seedless fruits, which are often preferred for consumption, and enabling fruit formation in the absence of pollinators. Fruits have distinctive physical features, such as scars from where they were attached to the flower, textures that can be smooth or rough, and colours that vary widely to attract different dispersers. Two scars are often visible on the fruit, marking important points of attachment. The style scar is where the style of the flower was attached, and the pedicel scar marks the point where the fruit was connected to the plant's stem. The ovary wall transforms into the fruit wall, also known as the pericarp, which can be divided into three distinct layers: the outer exocarp, forming the outer skin; the middle mesocarp, which may be fleshy or fibrous; and the inner endocarp, which directly surrounds the seeds and can be hard or soft, depending on the type of fruit. Fruits can be classified as true or false based on their origin. True fruits develop solely from the ovary, as in mangoes and tomatoes, where the fruit tissues arise entirely from the ovary wall. In contrast, false fruits, or accessory fruits, involve other floral parts in their formation, such as the receptacle in apples and strawberries. In these cases, the fleshy part is derived largely from the receptacle rather than the ovary itself. Fruits are also categorised based on their development into two types: simple and compound. A fruit is considered simple if it forms from a single ovary of a single flower consisting of one carpel (monocarpous) or numerous fused carpels (syncarpous). Simple fruits may be fleshy, like mangoes and peaches, or dry, like beans and nuts. A compound fruit results when many separate carpels function in creating the fruit. Compound fruits can be further classified as aggregate or multiple fruits. Aggregate fruits form from a single flower with multiple ovaries (apocarpous), each developing into a small fruitlet, as seen in strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. In contrast, multiple fruits arise from a cluster of flowers (an inflorescence), with each flower contributing to a single fruiting structure. Examples of multiple fruits include pineapples, jackfruits and figs, where the fruits are formed by the fusion of individual flowers within the inflorescence. Fruits can further be classified into dry fruits and succulent fruits, based on the texture of the pericarp. Dry fruits have a hard or papery pericarp and can be divided into two types: dry indehiscent fruits, which do not split open (dehisce) when mature to release seeds, and dry dehiscent fruits, which split open to release seeds upon maturity. Dry indehiscent fruits lack a natural line of weakness that would allow them to split apart. Thus, they retain their seeds within the pericarp until external forces disperse them. Examples include achenes, where the seed is attached to the pericarp at only one point (e.g., sunflower, buttercup, and dandelion); samaras, winged achenes adapted for wind dispersal (e.g., maple, elm, and ash); grains or caryopses, where the seed coat is fused to the pericarp, common in grasses (e.g., wheat, rice, maize, and barley); nuts, one-seeded fruits with a hard and woody pericarp (e.g., acorn, hazelnut, chestnut, and Brazil nut); and utricles, small, bladder-like fruits where the pericarp is thin and loosely surrounds the seed (e.g., amaranth and pigweed). On the other hand, dry dehiscent fruits have particular lines of weakness known as sutures. actively release seeds by splitting open at maturity. On the other hand, dry dehiscent fruits have particular lines of weakness known as sutures, strategic points where the fruit splits open at maturity, ensuring that seeds are dispersed effectively when the fruit is ripe. These include legumes, which split along two seams, common in the Fabaceae family (e.g., peas, beans, lentils, chickpeas, and tamarind); follicles, which split along one seam (e.g., milkweed, larkspur, and columbine); and capsules, which split in various ways (e.g., cotton, poppy, okra, lily, and eucalyptus). Capsules are further categorised into loculicidal capsules, which split along the locules (e.g., cotton and lilies); septicidal capsules, which split along the septa (e.g., agave and yucca); and poricidal capsules, which open by pores (e.g., poppies). Additionally, there are siliques and silicles, long or short fruits that split along two seams, common in the mustard family (e.g., radish, mustard, and wallflower), and schizocarps, which split into one-seeded segments called mericarps (e.g., carrot, fennel, coriander, and dill). In contrast, succulent fruits have a fleshy pericarp at maturity and are adapted to attract animals for seed dispersal. Examples of succulent fruits include berries, drupes, and pomes. Berries are typically fleshy throughout, such as tomatoes, guavas, bananas, avocados, blueberries, cranberries, huckleberries, gooseberries, kiwis, eggplants, coffee berries, grapes, and red, black, and white currants. A berry, in botanical terms, refers to a fleshy fruit that develops from a single ovary of a flower, meaning the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into an edible part; this is why bananas and avocados are considered berries, while strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are not, as they develop from multiple ovaries within a single flower. Hesperidia, a special type of berry with a leathery rind, is found in citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits. Pepos, a type of berry with a hard outer rind, are commonly found in cucumbers, melons (e.g., watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew), and squash. Drupes, also known as stone fruits, are fleshy fruits that develop from a single ovary and typically contain a single seed (sometimes more) encased within a hard, stony endocarp, commonly referred to as the "stone" or "pit." Examples of drupes include peaches, cherries, plums, apricots, olives, almonds, coconuts, and mangoes. Pomes, characterised by their fleshy receptacle, include apples, pears, quinces, and medlar. Other examples of succulent fruits include figs, which develop from a unique inflorescence, and passion fruits, known for their aromatic pulp and seeds. Figure241.1.7.flowering_plants_image_005.jpg. In all fruits, the arrangement of seeds within the ovary is determined by placentation, which refers to the pattern of attachment of ovules to the ovary wall, which later become the seeds in a fruit. The placenta is the part of the ovary where the ovules attach and the septum is a partition that divides the ovary into compartments called locules. However, not all fruits contain locules or septa, as their presence depends on the specific type of fruit. Marginal placentation, seen in legumes like peas and beans, involves ovules being attached along one side or margin of the ovary. Axile placentation is common in fruits like tomatoes, oranges, and lemons, where the ovules are attached to a central column with partitions dividing the ovary into chambers. Free-central placentation, where ovules are attached to a central column without partitions, can be observed in fruits like passion fruits and primroses. Parietal placentation occurs in fruits like cucumbers and melons, where the ovules are attached directly to the inner wall of the ovary, without partitions. Basal placentation, where the ovules are attached at the base of the ovary, is seen in fruits like sunflowers and daisies. Figure242.1.7.flowering_plants_image_006.jpg. Video158.Placentation.mp4. Dicot fruits exhibit a wide variety of forms, including fleshy fruits like berries, drupes (e.g., peaches), and pomes (e.g., apples), as well as dry fruits like capsules, legumes (e.g., beans) and nuts. They are typically adapted for animal-mediated dispersal, as they are often brightly coloured and palatable to attract animals, thereby promoting seed dispersal through their droppings. In contrast, monocot fruits are typically dry, single-seeded structures that develop from a single ovary. They are generally simpler in design and exhibit a more limited variety of forms, often classified as grains or caryopses (e.g., wheat, rice). In these fruits, the seed coat is fused with the pericarp, enhancing protection for the seed, while facilitating efficient dispersal by wind and water. Dry fruits usually split open upon maturity to release seeds, which may then be dispersed by wind, water, gravity, or mechanical mechanisms. However, some monocots, like bananas, produce fleshy fruits such as berries, deviating from the typically simple monocot structures but still lacking the complexity of many dicot fruits. Additionally, fruits may have specialised adaptations, like wings or parachutes, to aid in wind dispersal, or hooks, to attach to animal fur for transportation. The vascular arrangement within the fruits also varies between the two groups. In dicots, vascular bundles are often arranged in a ring within the fruit, reflecting their complex floral structure. Monocots, however, typically have scattered vascular bundles, which is consistent with their overall simpler organisation. In summary, while seeds are the reproductive units of plants, containing the embryo, cotyledons, a protective seed coat, and a single identifying, fruits are the mature structures that encase the seeds, typically having two scars, offering protection and promoting their dispersal through various physical adaptations. • In groups or as a whole class, discuss how the structures observed in the two plants carry out their functions.

Leaves can be classified based on a variety of characteristics, including their shape, arrangement on the stem, venation patterns, margins, surface texture, and even their function. Generally, a leaf is a thin, flattened structure that emerges from the nodes of a stem or its branches, featuring a bud in its axil (the angle between the stem and the leaf). While leaves are typically green due to the presence of chlorophyll, some may exhibit red or brown hues owing to different pigments. The leaf base is the lowermost part of the leaf that connects it to the stem. In dicots, it often bears stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures that can vary in form and function and are useful for species identification. In monocots, the leaf base commonly extends into a sheath that encircles the stem, providing additional support. The petiole (the stalk that joins a leaf to a stem via the leaf base) is the primary connection between the leaf and the plant's vascular system, allowing nutrients, water, and photosynthetic products to flow between the leaf and the stem. Leaves can be classified based on their attachment to the stem: petiolate leaves have a distinct petiole that connects them to the stem, allowing flexibility and positioning of the leaf for maximum sunlight capture. In contrast, sessile leaves lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem by their base. This direct attachment can occur through the leaf blade itself or via a leaf sheath that wraps around the stem, as seen in many grasses and monocots. The venation pattern, the arrangement of veins within the leaf blade, provides further valuable classification information. Parallel venation, characteristic of monocotyledons, features veins running parallel to each other. Reticulate venation, typical of dicotyledons, forms a network of interconnected veins. Other notable venation patterns include pinnate venation, with a prominent midrib and smaller veins branching off laterally, and palmate venation, where veins radiate from a central point. Figure243.1.7.flowering_plants_image_007.jpg. In terms of shape, leaves are broadly divided into simple and compound types. Simple leaves possess a single, undivided blade (lamina) directly attached to the stem. This blade exhibits a wide range of shapes, including linear (long and narrow), lanceolate (lance-shaped), ovate (egg-shaped), cordate (heart-shaped), and many others. The leaf margin, which refers to the edge of the leaf, can exhibit a variety of forms. These include entire margins that are smooth and unbroken; toothed margins, which can be either serrated (having a saw-like edge with teeth pointing forward or toward the leaf apex), dentate (featuring sharp, pointed teeth that point outward and are often square or rectangular in shape), crenate (having rounded or scalloped teeth that create a wavy appearance), or incised (characterised by deep, irregular cuts or notches extending toward the midrib, giving the edge a jagged look); lobed margins with deep indentations that that extend less than halfway towards the midrib, and vary in depth and shape; lobate margins, with shallower indentations, that don't reach as far into the leaf blade as in lobed leaves; undulate margins that have widely wavy edges; revolute margins that curl under towards the leaf's underside; filiform margins that appear thin and elongated, resembling fine threads; pinnate margins, which have multiple small lobes or segments along the edge; and deeply dissected margins that create intricate patterns. Figure244.1.7.flowering_plants_image_008.jpg. In contrast, compound leaves consist of multiple leaflets attached to a common petiolule, a smaller stalk that attaches an individual leaflet to the central axis (midrib or rachis) of a compound leaf. Not all leaflets have petiolules; some are sessile and attach directly to the rachis. Unlike a true leaf, a leaflet cannot function independently as it is only a part of the whole leaf structure. Leaflets lack axillary buds at their base, which is a distinguishing feature of true leaves. Compound leaves exhibit a variety of distinct patterns in leaflet arrangement. In pinnately compound leaves, leaflets are arranged alternately (one leaflet at each node on the rachis) or oppositely (two leaflets at each node) along either side of the rachis, often in pairs, resembling a feather. These can be further classified into imparipinnate, where the rachis ends in a single terminal leaflet, resulting in an odd number of leaflets; paripinnate, where there is no terminal leaflet, resulting in an even number of leaflets; bipinnate, where the primary leaflets (pinna) are further divided into secondary leaflets (pinnules); and tripinnate, where the secondary leaflets are further subdivided into tertiary leaflets, creating a highly compound leaf structure. In contrast, palmately compound leaves have leaflets radiating from a single point at the end of the petiole, resembling the fingers of a hand. Variations include digitate, with five or more leaflets arising from a single point, and trifoliate, with three leaflets. In some cases, leaves or leaflets may exhibit a pulvinus at the base of the petiole. This is a swollen joint-like structure at the base of a leaf or leaflet. It contains specialised cells that can change their turgor pressure, allowing the leaf or leaflet to move in response to stimuli such as light, touch, or changes in temperature. This movement is known as pulvinar movement and is observed in plants like Mimosa pudica (a sensitive plant). Leaf arrangement on the stem, known as phyllotaxy, is another key feature for classification. It can be alternate, with leaves arising singly in a staggered pattern at different nodes along the stem; opposite, with two leaves arising from the same node on opposite sides of the stem; whorled, with three or more leaves arising in a circular arrangement from the same node; or spiral, where leaves are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem. Figure245.1.7.flowering_plants_image_009.jpg. Figure246.1.7.flowering_plants_image_010.jpg. Furthermore, leaf texture contributes significantly to the classification process, with surfaces exhibiting a wide range of variations, including smooth, rough, hairy, waxy, glossy (shiny and smooth), leathery, velvety, scaly, papery, spongy, succulent (thick and fleshy), prickly, wrinkled, ridged, sticky, powdery, pubescent (covered with soft, short hairs), tomentose (densely covered with matted, woolly hairs), glandular (bearing glands that may secrete substances), or corrugated (wrinkled or ridged). These textural variations often reflect adaptations to environmental factors such as water loss, herbivory, and temperature extremes, highlighting the intricate relationship between leaf structure and ecological conditions. Finally, leaves can also be classified based on their function. While most leaves are green and specialised for photosynthesis, others have adapted for specific purposes. For example, leaves may be modified into spines for protection (e.g., cacti), tendrils for climbing (e.g., peas), storage organs (e.g., onion bulbs), scale leaves for covering delicate parts and reducing water loss (e.g., ginger), reproductive organs for vegetative propagation (e.g., the mother of thousands, formerly known as Bryophyllum), or structures adapted for insect capture and digestion in insectivorous plants (e.g., the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plants). These characteristics, considered in combination, provide a comprehensive framework for classifying leaves, which not only aids in plant identification, but also offers valuable insights into the diverse adaptations of leaves to their respective environments and functions.
