RADIOACTIVITY: This is the spontaneous disintegration of unstable nucleus to form a stable nucleus with emission of radiations. Radioactivity is not affected by eternal factors like temperature and pressure. There are three radiations emitted by the radioactive nucleus and these are; i) Alpha particles, α. ii) Beta particles, β. iii) Gamma rays, γ. Alpha particle, α: Alpha particle is a high speed helium nucleus ( ). Alpha particles have a mass number of 4 and atomic number of 2 and carry a positive charge. Properties of alpha particles:  They are slightly deflected by both magnetic and electric fields because of their large mass.  They are positively charged.  They have the greatest ionizing power.  They have the least penetrating power.  They are stopped by a thick sheet of paper.  They have very short range in air.  They affect the photographic films.  They have speed less than the speed of light.  They produce flashes when incident on fluorescent substance. Beta particle, β: A beta particle is a high speed electron emitted from the nucleus of a radioactive atom. Beta particles have no mass number and carry a negative charge ( ). A beta particle is produced as a result of one of the neutrons changing to a proton Properties of beta particles:  They are negatively charged.  They are easily deflected by both magnetic and electric fields because they are lighter.  They have greater penetrating power than alpha particles because of their high speed.  They have less ionizing power than alpha particle.  They can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium.  They have a greater range in air than alpha particles.  They produce flashes when incident on fluorescent substance Contacts: +256 787 976 337/+256 759 398 109 Email: josephsemu@ymail.com Page - 378 - Gamma rays, γ: Gamma ray is high energy electromagnetic radiation of very short wave length emitted from the nucleus of the radioactive substance. Gamma rays have no mass number and carry no charge. Gamma rays are produced when an excited atomic nucleus loses energy and the energy is given out as gamma rays. Properties of gamma rays:  They are not charged.  They travel at a speed of light since they are electromagnetic radiations.  They are not deflected by both magnetic and electric fields since they are not charged.  They have the least ionizing power.  They have the greatest penetrating power.  They undergo interference and diffraction.  They cause fluorescence when incident on fluorescence substances. Penetrating power of the radiations: Alpha particles have the least penetrating power and can be stopped by a thick sheet of paper. Beta particles have greater penetrating power than alpha particles and can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium while gamma rays have the greatest penetrating power and can be stopped by thick block of lead Ionizing power of the radiations: Alpha particles produce straight traces because they are heavy and they cause greater ionization of the gases through which they pass. Beta particles produce irregular and light traces while gamma rays do not produce any trace when the radiations are in a cloud chamber detector. Deflection of the radiations in an electric field: When the radiations from a radioactive nucleus are passed through a strong electric field the beta particle s are deflected towards a positive plate showing that they carry a negative charge. Alpha particles are deflected towards a negative plate in the direction opposite to that of beta particles showing that alpha particles carry a positive plate. The gamma rays are not deflected at all showing that they carry no charge.

Alpha particles are deflected to the direction opposite to that of beta particles showing that alpha particles carry a positive charge but heavier than beta particles. The gamma rays are not deflected at all showing that they carry no charge. Radioactive decay: This is the process of spontaneous break down of radioactive nuclide. A radioactive nuclide is an atomic species of a radioactive substance which continuously breaks down with emission of radiations. Types of radioactive decay: a) Alpha decay: When a nuclide undergoes an alpha decay, it loses two protons and two neutrons. Therefore its mass number reduces by four and its atomic number reduces by two and the daughter nuclide is two steps to the left in the periodic table. Given that a radioactive element, undergoes an alpha decay to form element Y. Then the nuclear reaction equation is given by Examples: 1. Radium [Ra] decays to become radon [Rn] according to the equation 2. Uranium [U] decays to become thorium [Th] according to the equation b) Beta decay: When a nuclide undergoes beta decay its mass number does not change but its atomic number increases by one and the daughter nuclide is one step to the right in the periodic table. This is because electrons do not exist inside the nucleus but can be produced when a neutron changes into a proton and an electron, the proton then remains in the nucleus hence increasing the atomic number and an electron is lost from the nucleus. Given that a radioactive element, undergoes a beta decay to form element Y. Then the nuclear reaction equation is given by Ra 226 88 Rn 222 86 He 4 + 2 U 238 92 Th 234 90 He 4 + 2 Radioactive source γ – Rays β - Particles α - Particles Contacts: +256 787 976 337/+256 759 398 109 Email: josephsemu@ymail.com Page - 380 - Example: Carbon -14 decays to become Nitrogen according to the equation. c) Gamma decay: Gamma rays are not particles, therefore when nuclide emits gamma rays its atomic number and its mass number do not change but the nucleus becomes more stable. Given that a radioactive element, undergoes a gamma decay to form a stable element X. Then the nuclear reaction equation is given by Note: The change of an element to another element is called Transmutation Uses of radioactivity: a) Medical uses:  Radiations are used in radiotherapy [in treatment of cancerous cells] that is gamma rays are usually used to destroy cancer cells.  Medical instruments are sterilized using gamma rays.  Radiations are used to detect brain tumours.  Radiations are used to detect lung and heart problems.  Radiations destroy germs. b) Industrial uses:  Radioactive elements are used to measure fluid flow in pipes in industries.  Radioactive elements are used to provide source of energy [electricity].  Radioactive elements are used in hardening polythene and petroleum.  Radioactive elements are used in food preservation.  Radioactive elements are used as tracers in identifying oil leakages in oil pipes.  Radioactive elements are used to measure the thickness of the metal sheet.  Radioactive elements are used as level indictor that is to check the filling packets of soap powders. c) Agricultural uses:  Radioactive elements produce varieties of plants with new characteristics.  Radioactive elements are used as tracers to study the uptake of fertilizers by plants.  Radioactive elements can be used in pest control. d) Carbon dating:  Carbon dating forms a radioactive carbon-dioxide which is taken up by plants in the manufacture of carbohydrates by photosynthesis. When plants are cut down the atoms will start to decay by emission of beta particles and by measuring the residue and half life the age of the ancient containing carbon can be estimated. Health hazards of radioactivity:  Radiations cause blood cancer.  Radiations cause radiation burns.  Radiations cause sterility [inability to produce].

Safety precautions when handling radioactive elements:  They should be handled using long pair of tongs.  They should be transported in thick lead containers.  You should avoid unnecessary exposure to the radiations.  You should wear protective clothing when handling radioactive elements.  You should not eat or drink where radioactive sources are in use.  You should cover any wound before using radioactive source. Background radiations: These are ionizing radiations from a variety of natural and artificial sources and are always present in the environment. Background radiation is all around us, most background radiation comes from natural sources, while most artificial background radiation comes from medical examinations, such as x-ray photographs. Natural sources: Natural sources of background radiation include the following: Cosmic Radiation: These are radiations that reach the Earth from space. The sun is a major source of 'cosmic radiation'. The sun and stars send a constant stream of cosmic radiation to Earth. Cosmic rays originating from the sun, stars and other major events in outer space are continuously striking the Earth. The majority of these cosmic rays are absorbed by the Earth atmosphere but the more energetic radiations interact with the atoms in the atmosphere creating energetic neutrons. Other energetic rays such as gamma rays can make it through the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. Terrestrial Radiation: The Earth itself is a source of terrestrial radiation. Radioactive materials (including uranium, thorium, and radium) exist naturally in soil and rock. Some rocks are radioactive and give off radioactive radon gas. Essentially all air contains radon. In addition, water contains small amounts of dissolved uranium and thorium, and all organic matter (both plant and animal) contains radioactive carbon and potassium. Some of these materials are ingested with food and water, while others (such as radon) are taken in. The Earth contains radioactive rocks. Radioisotopes with long half-lives such as Uranium-235, Uranium-238 and Thorium-232 still remain along with the radioisotopes formed from the decay of the long lived isotopes. During the radioactive decay of Uranium, Radon gas is produced which passes through rocks underground and introduced into the atmosphere. Radon gas is radioactive and accounts for a large proportion of the natural background radiation. Internal Radiation: Small traces of radioactive materials are present in the human body. These come from natural radioactive sources such as Carbon-14 in the air we breathe. Fruits and crops take in radioactive materials from the soil as well as Carbon-14 from the air. These are introduced into the body when they are eaten or via the food chain when meat or milk from animals grazing on the crops is Contacts: +256 787 976 337/+256 759 398 109 Email: josephsemu@ymail.com Page - 382 - consumed. Therefore all people have internal radiation, mainly from radioactive potassium- 40 and carbon-14 inside their bodies from birth and, therefore, are sources of exposure to others. And living things like plants absorb radioactive materials from the soil and these pass up the food chain Artificial sources: Human activity has added to background radiation by using artificial sources of radiation which include the following; Nuclear power stations: Major incidents from nuclear power stations have released radiations into the environment. Nuclear waste from power station also accounts for a proportion of artificial background radiation Nuclear weapons: Nuclear weapon testing resulted in an increase of radiation in the environment because of radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing. Medical sources: Humans are exposed to radiations by medical procedures such as x-rays and radiotherapy. Nearly all artificial background radiation comes from medical procedures such as receiving x-rays for x-ray photographs. Detecting the radiation: The following can be used to detect radiations; Photographic film: Photographic film goes darker when it absorbs radiation, just like it does when it absorbs visible light. The more radiation the film absorbs, the darker it is when it is developed. People, who work with radiation, wear film badges which are checked regularly to monitor the levels of radiation absorbed. Geiger-Muller tube and Cloud Chamber: The Geiger-Muller tube or cloud chamber detects radiation and each time it absorbs radiation, it transmits an electrical pulse to a counting machine. This makes a clicking sound or displays the count rate. The greater the frequency of clicks, the higher the count rate and the more radiation the Geiger-Muller tube or cloud chamber is absorbing. NUCLEAR REACTIONS: This is a process in which energy is produced. There are two types of nuclear reactions and these are i) Nuclear fusion. ii) Nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion: This is a process by which two light nuclei combine to form a heavy nucleus with release of energy. It takes place at the sun, stars and in the hydrogen bomb. Example Two Deuterium nuclei combine to form Helium -3 and a neutron with release of energy H 2 1 He 3 H 2 2 1 n 1 + + 0 + Energy Contacts: +256 787 976 337/+256 759 398 109 Email: josephsemu@ymail.com Page - 383 - Conditions for nuclear fusion: i) It occurs at very high temperature of about 108K. ii) Presence of two light nuclei. iii) It requires high speed moving nuclei. Nuclear fission: This is the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two nuclei with release of energy. It takes place in nuclear reactors and in the atomic bombs. Example Splitting of uranium-236 to form Barium (Ba) and Krypton (Kr) with release of energy Conditions for nuclear fission: i) It occurs at very low temperature. ii) Presence of energetic slow moving neutron. iii) Presence of a heavy nucleus, Examples: 1. Find the values of x and y in the above nuclear fission reaction 236 = 144 + y + 2 92 = x + 36 + 0 236 = 146 + y 92 = x + 36 y = 90 x = 56 2.

The neutrons collide with other atoms and the energy possessed by the neutrons changes to heat energy. The heat energy is then absorbed by the coolant and is made to heat water to produce steam. The steam then drives the turbines connected to a generator and electricity is produced. Functions of the parts: i) Control rods are made of boron or cadmium and they control the fission rate that is they absorb neutrons that would initiate a fission reaction. ii) The moderator is made of graphite or heavy water at very high pressure and it is used to slow the neutrons there by making them to be absorbed by the uranium atoms iii) Coolant is made of water at very high pressure, liquid sodium or carbon-dioxide and is used to absorb heat from the reactor core. iv) Uranium rods are made of uranium and they are as fuel which contains uranium-235. The atoms of uranium undergo fission and produce energy v) The concrete shield absorbs any radiation from the fission fragments or from the fuel directly. NOTE: Heavy water at very high pressure is used instead of ordinary water as a moderator because heavy water does not absorb the neutrons since it contains deuterium atoms and high pressure prevents it from boiling and thus not turning into a vapour. Uses of nuclear reactors: i) they used to produce new elements. ii) they are used to produce nuclear fuel. iii) they are used to produce power that it acts as source of energy. Problems nuclear power station face: i) There may be an explosion due the radiations from the environment. ii) There may be fuel leakage. iii) Global warming due to the heat given out. iv) Dangers from radioactive waste.

Half life is measured in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. Half life is not affected by physical factors like temperature and pressure and half life is different for different radioactive nuclides.
