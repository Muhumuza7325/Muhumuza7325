Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand atomic structure, the processes of nuclear fission and fusion, the use we can make of them, and the dangers associated with them (k, u); b) Understand the spontaneous and random nature of nuclear decay and interpret decay data in terms of halflife (u, s); c) Understand and appreciate that there are significant social, political, and environmental dimensions associated with use of nuclear power (u). In this very chapter, we will delve into the highly debated topic of nuclear energy, building on our prior knowledge of the periodic table from Chapter 6. Our goal is to gather, evaluate, and critically discuss information about nuclear energy to make an informed decision about whether to support building a nuclear power plant in our community as the main source of fuel. Let's begin by recalling the chemical reactions we've studied so far. In those reactions, the atoms of an element never changed into different elements; only the electrons were involved in the changes. However, we now need to understand that a large nucleus can split into smaller nuclei, light nuclei can combine to form a heavier nucleus, nuclei with 84 or more protons are always radioactive, elements with fewer than 84 protons can have both stable and unstable isotopes, and that radioactive elements and those with unstable nuclei can undergo nuclear changes, transforming into different elements. These processes, involving the nucleus of the atom, are called nuclear processes and the transformation of one element into another is known as transmutation. [Assignment 1] {What is atomic structure, what are the processes of nuclear fission and fusion, and how can we make use of them, and what are the dangers associated with them}. In Chapter 6, we learnt that an atom is the smallest particle of an element that can participate in a chemical reaction. Each atom, unique to its element, consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons arranged in orbitals or energy levels. The nucleus, made up of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, imparts a positive charge. We explored how atoms vary in size, from the simple hydrogen atom with one proton and one electron to large atoms like uranium, with 92 protons and 92 electrons. We also covered isotopes — atoms of the same element with the same atomic number but different mass numbers. An isotope of uranium (chemical symbol U) consists of 92 protons and 143 neutrons. Give the two different ways of notating this isotope. The mass number of the Uranium isotope = 92 + 143 = 235. Figure349.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_001.jpg. Nuclear reactions: Nuclear reactions are processes that involve changes in the nucleus of an atom. Despite their differences, nuclear and chemical reactions share some similarities. Both generally follow the law of conservation of mass, striving to maintain the total amount of matter throughout the reaction. However, the way they achieve stability and the types of energy involved are fundamentally distinct. Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of electrons in the outer shells of atoms, aiming for a stable electron configuration. Nuclear reactions, on the other hand, focus on achieving a stable nucleus by altering the ratio of protons and neutrons, often with a much larger release of energy in the form of radiation or heat compared to the smaller energy transfers (heat, light, sound) seen in chemical reactions. The main types of nuclear reactions include nuclear fission, where a large nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing energy (e.g., Uranium-235 fission); nuclear fusion, where light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy (e.g., hydrogen fusion in the sun); and radioactive decay, where unstable nuclei emit radiation (alpha, beta, gamma rays, positron emission, or electron capture). Additionally, neutron capture involves a nucleus absorbing a neutron, leading to radioactive decay, while spontaneous fission sees heavy nuclei splitting without external induction. Nuclear reactions can also be induced by particle bombardment, resulting in the transmutation of elements. All these processes involve significant energy changes within the atomic nucleus. Nuclear Fission: In the realm of nuclear physics, certain isotopes like Uranium-235 (U-235) and Plutonium-239 are classified as fissile. These isotopes possess an inherent instability and can spontaneously undergo a process called nuclear fission. Nuclear fission occurs in a high-temperature environment when a fissile isotope absorbs a neutron, either slow or fast, depending on the specific isotope. This neutron triggers the splitting of the heavy atomic nucleus into two smaller/lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and additional neutrons in the process. These released neutrons can then go on to induce fission in other fissile nuclei, creating a chain reaction that sustains the fission process. This very principle of nuclear fission underpins the generation of electricity in nuclear power plants. However, it's also the force behind the immense destructive power harnessed in weapons of mass destruction such as atomic bombs. Example: Splitting of uranium-236 to form Barium (Ba) and Krypton (Kr) with release of energy. Figure350.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_002.jpg. Find the values of x and y in the below nuclear fission reaction. Figure351.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_003.jpg. Figure352.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_004.jpg. Identify X in the below nuclear fission reaction. Figure353.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_005.jpg. Figure354.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_006.jpg. Applications of nuclear fission: Nuclear power plants use controlled fission reactions to produce electricity. The heat generated from fission is used to produce steam, which drives turbines connected to generators. Nuclear weapons utilise uncontrolled fission reactions to release massive amounts of energy in the form of an explosion. Fission-produced isotopes are used in medical imaging and cancer treatments. Fission reactors are used for research in physics, materials science, and other fields. Nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors are the workhorses behind clean electricity generation. Unlike kettles using fire, they harness controlled nuclear fission to create immense heat, boiling water into steam that spins turbines. But these marvels extend beyond electricity production. They can forge new elements for scientific exploration and medical imaging, even produce life-saving medical isotopes. However, tight controls and safety measures are paramount to prevent accidents and radiation leaks. The diagram below shows a nuclear reactor that produces electricity by nuclear fission: Figure355.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_007.jpg. Generation of electricity using a nuclear reactor: The heart of a nuclear reactor lies in the controlled chaos of nuclear fission. A single neutron collides with a uranium-235 nucleus, transforming it into a short-lived, unstable uranium-236. This giant promptly splits into two "daughter nuclei," releasing a burst of energy and 2 or 3 high-speed neutrons. These energetic neutrons hold the key to a chain reaction, but their speed makes it difficult for them to cause further fissions. Here's where a moderator, like water or graphite, steps in. It acts as a traffic cop, slowing down these neutrons, allowing them to interact more effectively with other uranium-235 atoms, perpetuating the chain reaction. As a result, the energy initially possessed by the neutrons is converted into heat energy within the reactor core. This controlled release of energy heats a high-pressure coolant (water, liquid sodium, or carbon dioxide) circulating around the core. Acting as a heat transfer agent, the hot coolant boils water in a separate chamber, generating high-pressure steam. This steam doesn't power the turbines directly; it's the driving force. The steam spins a turbine, converting the thermal energy of the steam into the kinetic energy of the rotating turbine shaft. The magic happens in the generator connected to the turbine shaft. Here, the kinetic energy is transformed into electrical energy, the usable power we utilise. Detailed functions of some parts: Control rods, typically made of neutron-absorbing materials like boron or cadmium, regulate the fission rate within the core. The moderator, typically light water (ordinary water) or graphite, slows energetic neutrons down. However, in some reactors, heavy water at very high pressure, with its deuterium atoms (hydrogen atoms with one extra neutron), is sometimes the preferred moderator. This is because heavy water absorbs fewer neutrons compared to regular water, allowing for a more efficient chain reaction. Additionally, the high pressure applied to the heavy water prevents it from boiling and turning into vapour, ensuring its effectiveness within the reactor core. Graphite, another common moderator choice, offers similar neutron-slowing properties without the complexities of handling heavy water. Finally, a thick concrete shield acts as a guardian, absorbing any stray radiation and protecting the environment. This intricate interplay of physics, engineering, and chemistry within the nuclear reactor core is the heart of nuclear power generation. Dangers of nuclear fission: Fission produces radioactive byproducts that can be harmful to human health and the environment. Uncontrolled reactions or failures in cooling systems can lead to catastrophic events, such as the Chernobyl or Fukushima disasters. The spread of nuclear technology and materials poses risks of nuclear weapons development and use. Video92.nuclear_power.mp4. Nuclear fusion: Nuclear fusion involves combining two lighter nuclei (e.g., hydrogen isotopes like deuterium and tritium) into one or more heavier atomic nuclei (e.g., helium), and subatomic particles such as neutrons and protons. For example, 2 deuterium nuclei can fuse together under high temperatures and pressure to form Helium-3 and a neutron. Figure356.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_008.jpg. Nuclear fusion releases a tremendous amount of energy, even greater than fission. It also promises a clean energy future, as it produces less radioactive waste than fission. However, achieving controlled fusion reactions remains a significant scientific and technological challenge. Here's why: Fusion requires a challenging trifecta of conditions. First, temperatures must soar to a staggering 100 million Kelvin, creating a hot, dense soup of charged particles known as plasma. Second, the nuclei themselves need to be light, as fusion becomes increasingly difficult with heavier elements. Finally, this high-temperature plasma needs to be confined at a high density for a significant amount of time (confinement time) to allow for enough collisions between nuclei and the sustained fusion reaction. In fact, the sun is a natural fusion reactor. In its core, high temperatures and pressures continuously cause nuclei to separate from their electrons, facilitating the nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium. This process enables the sun to emit the enormous energy required for life on Earth. Interestingly, nuclear fusion also occurs naturally in the stars and even forms the basis for the immense destructive power of hydrogen bombs. While replicating these stellar conditions on Earth for a more controlled and sustainable energy source remains a challenge, scientists are actively working towards overcoming this hurdle. For example, research is ongoing to develop practical fusion reactors (e.g., ITER) that could provide a clean, abundant energy source with fewer environmental impacts. Fusion could also potentially be used for advanced spacecraft propulsion, enabling faster travel within our solar system and beyond. Dangers of nuclear fusions: Although fusion produces less long-lived radioactive waste, it still generates neutrons that can activate surrounding materials, making them radioactive. The high-energy environment and potential for accidents pose safety risks, although less severe than those associated with fission. In conclusion, nuclear fission and fusion offer powerful means of energy production with distinct advantages and challenges. Fission is currently a viable and widely used technology, albeit with significant safety and environmental risks. Fusion promises a cleaner, virtually limitless energy source, but remains technologically challenging to achieve on a practical scale. Both processes require careful management to mitigate their associated dangers and maximise their benefits. Video89.nuclear_fission_and_fusion.mp4. [Assignment 2] {Explore the spontaneous and random nature of nuclear decay and interpret decay data in terms of halflife}. Effect of radiations on atoms of elements. Unlike the electron sharing that forms bonds (Chapter 10), radiation disrupts atoms by interacting with their electron cloud. This can knock out electrons, affecting how atoms bond, or excite them, releasing energy. In rare cases, very high-energy radiation might even hit the nucleus itself. Radiation, which is energy traveling through space in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves, can come in various forms. While sunlight is the most common type of radiation, other types, such as television and radio waves, are not visible to the human eye. Radiation can be classified into two major categories based on their energy and penetrating capabilities: ionising and non-ionising radiation. i) Non-ionising radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and visible light, cannot directly alter the chemical structure of materials. ii) Ionising radiation, on the other hand, which includes X-rays, gamma rays, alpha particles, and beta particles, has enough energy to remove electrons from atoms in the materials it penetrates, such as our bodies. This ability to ionise makes ionising radiation potentially harmful to life. Particles in radiation with sufficient energy to collide with and knock electrons off atoms are called radioactive particles. Ionisation causes chemical bonds to break, which can harm the human body by altering its chemical bonds. Ionising radiation can be further categorised into two sources: i) Natural background radiation: This is low-level ionising radiation present everywhere in our environment. It arises primarily from natural sources: a) Cosmic rays: High-energy particles originating from space that bombard the Earth's atmosphere. Space travel planning considers cosmic radiation as a potential hazard for astronauts. b) Radioactive elements in the Earth's crust (terrestrial radiation): Elements like uranium and thorium naturally decay, releasing radiation. Areas with granite and other igneous rocks may have higher background radiation due to these elements. c) Radon gas: This radioactive gas seeps from the ground and can accumulate in buildings, particularly basements. Radon is estimated to contribute about 50% of natural background radiation exposure. While primarily natural, some radon can also arise from human-made sources like nuclear waste products. d) Trace amounts in our bodies (Internal radiation): Even our bodies contain small quantities of naturally radioactive elements like potassium-40 and carbon-14 (formed by the sun's radiation). Additionally, trace amounts of artificial isotopes like strontium-90 from nuclear fallout may be present. ii) Artificial radiation: This is a much smaller contributor to background radiation and originates from human activities such as: a) Nuclear power generation: Leakage or accidents associated with nuclear power plants can release radiation. b) Nuclear weapon testing: Fallout from past nuclear weapons testing contributes a small amount to background radiation. c) Medical procedures: X-rays, radioisotopes used in cancer treatment, and radioactive tracers for diagnosis all involve controlled exposure to ionising radiation. d) Industrial processes: Some industrial applications, such as sterilisation or material testing, may utilise radiation sources. Note that the exposure to background radiation is unavoidable and that the average person receives a relatively low dose each year, with variations depending on factors like altitude and location. It's important to note that artificial radiation typically accounts for only a small percentage of overall background radiation exposure. Though, ionising radiation cannot be felt, smelt, tasted, seen, or heard, its effects can be mitigated through shielding. Shielding refers to materials and techniques employed to block or weaken radiation, protecting people and the environment from its harmful effects. Despite its potential dangers, ionising radiation has valuable applications (to be covered in detail later in this very chapter). Radioactivity: Naturally occurring elements like uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust slowly change form, producing decay products such as radium and radon upon exposure to radiation. These elements are known as radioactive elements, and the process causing this effect on atoms is called radioactivity. Generally, when the nucleus of an atom is unstable and spontaneously emits energy in the form of a radiation, the result is that the nucleus changes into the nucleus of one or more other elements. The daughter nucleus or nuclei have a lower mass and are more stable (lower in energy) than the parent nucleus. This process is called nuclear decay/radioactive decay/radioactivity/radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration. Radioactivity was first discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896. While studying phosphorescence, Henri accidentally observed that uranium ore, even in darkness, could fog a photographic plate, revealing an unknown radiation. Radioactivity is the spontaneous disintegration of an unstable atomic nucleus (radioactive nuclide) into a more stable nucleus, with the emission of radiation. Since radioactivity is invisible and cannot be directly sensed by our bodies, instruments are necessary to detect its presence. One common tool is the Geiger-Müller tube, often shortened to Geiger tube. More sophisticated instruments, like scintillation counters and spectrometers, are often used for advanced radiation analysis. The term "activity" refers to the rate of decay within a source of unstable nuclei, and the activity of a radioactive sample decreases over time. A sample with high activity exhibits a rapid decay rate, signifying a larger number of nuclei decaying per unit time. This intrinsic property is measured in Becquerel (Bq), where 1 Bq corresponds to one decay per second. Count rate, on the other hand, quantifies the number of decays actually detected by a radiation detector, such as a Geiger tube, within a specific time period. Safety precautions when handling radioactive elements: Figure357.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_009.jpg. Due to the health risks associated with radiation exposure, strict safety protocols must be followed. Radioactive materials should only be handled with proper equipment like tongs and long forceps, never bare hands. Storage and transport require thick lead containers to minimise radiation leakage. When working with these materials, wear protective clothing like gloves and lead aprons to shield your body. Furthermore, avoid unnecessary exposure altogether, and never eat, drink, or smoke in areas where radioactive sources are present. Always ensure any wounds are covered before handling radioactive materials. Major types of ionising radiation. The three major types of ionising radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei are alpha particles, α, beta particles, β and electromagnetic waves like gamma rays, γ. These types differ in their mass, energy, and penetration ability into people and objects. Neutrons (n) can also be emitted during some radioactive decay processes, but they are not considered ionising radiation in this context. Alpha particle, α: Figure358.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_010.jpg. An Alpha particle is a high-speed helium nucleus. Alpha particles have a mass number of 4 and atomic number of 2 and carry a positive charge. They are emitted by some of the isotopes of the heaviest elements. Figure359.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_011.jpg. Properties of alpha particles: They are slightly deflected by both magnetic and electric fields because of their large mass. They are positively charged. They have the greatest ionising power. They have the least penetrating power. They are stopped by a thick sheet of paper. They have a very short range in air. They affect the photographic films. Their speed is less than that of light. They produce flashes when incident on a fluorescent substance. Beta particle, β: Figure360.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_012.jpg. Beta particles have no mass number and come in two forms: i) Beta-minus (β⁻): Emitted from a nucleus with too many neutrons. During this decay, a neutron in the nucleus undergoes a transformation. It breaks down into a proton and an electron (β⁻). The proton stays in the nucleus, and the high-speed electron is ejected as the beta particle. ii) Beta-plus (β⁺): Emitted from a nucleus with too many protons. Here, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron (β⁺), which is the anti-electron with a positive charge. The positron is emitted as the beta particle. Both beta-minus and beta-plus decay allow the nucleus to achieve a more stable balance between protons and neutrons. An electron neutrino (ν_e), released in both forms of beta-decay, to conserve momentum and spin, is not explicitly shown in most equations due to its elusive nature. Figure361.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_013.jpg. Figure362.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_014.jpg. Properties of beta particles: Beta particles carry either a negative charge (beta-minus) or a positive charge (beta-plus). They are easily deflected by both magnetic and electric fields because they are lighter. They have greater penetrating power than alpha particles because of their high speed. They have less ionising power than alpha particles. They can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium. They have a greater range in air than alpha particles. They produce flashes when incident on a fluorescent substance. Note that both alpha and beta decay cause an isotope to change atomic number and therefore element. This is because these decays involve the conversion of a proton or neutron within the nucleus. Alpha decay specifically also causes a change in mass number (total number of protons and neutrons) by 4. This is because an alpha particle itself is a helium nucleus with two protons and two neutrons. Figure363.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_015.jpg. Gamma rays, γ: Figure364.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_016.jpg. A gamma ray is a high energy electromagnetic radiation of very short wave length emitted from the nucleus of a radioactive substance. Gamma rays have no mass number and carry no charge. They are produced when an excited/unstable atomic nucleus loses energy that is given out as gamma rays. Gamma radiation often occurs after a nucleus has emitted an alpha or beta particle. Figure365.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_017.jpg. Properties of gamma rays: They are not charged. They travel at a speed of light since they are electromagnetic radiations. They are not deflected by both magnetic and electric fields since they are not charged. They have the least ionising power. They have the greatest penetrating power. They undergo interference and diffraction. They cause fluorescence when incident on fluorescence substances. Penetrating power of the radiations: Alpha particles have the least penetrating power and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or even dead skin. Beta particles have greater penetrating power than alpha particles and can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium. Gamma rays have the greatest penetrating power and require thick blocks of concrete or lead to be significantly stopped. Figure366.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_018.jpg. Ionising power of the radiations: Alpha particles produce straight traces because they are heavy and they cause greater ionisation of the gases through which they pass. Beta particles produce irregular and light traces while gamma rays do not produce any trace when the radiations are in a cloud chamber detector. A cloud chamber is a particle detector used to visualize the paths of charged ionising radiation by creating a supersaturated environment with water vapour or alcohol vapour. Figure367.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_019.jpg. Deflection of the radiations in an electric field: When the radiations from a radioactive nucleus are passed through a strong electric field, the beta-minus particles are deflected towards a positive plate showing that they carry a negative charge. Alpha particles are deflected towards a negative plate in the direction opposite to that of beta-minus particles, showing that alpha particles carry a positive charge. The gamma rays are not deflected at all showing that they carry no charge. Figure368.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_020.jpg. Deflection of the radiations in a magnetic field: When the radiations from a radioactive nucleus are passed through a strong magnetic field, the beta-minus particles are deflected according to Fleming’s right-hand rule showing that they carry a negative charge. Alpha particles are deflected to the direction opposite to that of beta particles showing that alpha particles carry a positive charge but heavier than beta particles. The gamma rays are not deflected at all showing that they carry no charge. Figure369.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_021.jpg. Video90.properties_of_radiations.mp4. Applications of radioactivity: Radiation and radioactivity existed long before life evolved on Earth and are indispensable parts of the environment. Man has always been exposed to natural radiation arising from Earth as well as from outside. Most people, upon hearing the word radioactivity, think only about something harmful or even deadly. The applications of radioactivity have played a significant role in improving the quality of human life. Some of its applications are evidenced in tracing, radiography, food preservation and sterilisation, eradication of insects and pests and medical diagnosis and therapy. Medical applications: High-energy radiation targets and destroys cancer cells in radiotherapy, while X-rays, PET scans, and nuclear scans using radioactive isotopes, aid in diagnosing various ailments. Radiation's germ-killing power sterilises medical instruments, and research continues on the use of radiation in pain management and targeted therapies. Industrial applications: Radioactive isotopes play a vital role in various processes: They act as tracers in pipelines, allowing for the identification of leaks (oil or fluid flow) and measurement of flow rates. These isotopes aid measurement of the thickness of metal sheets, ensuring quality control in manufacturing. They even find use in level indicators, ensuring proper filling of products like soap powder packets, and can be used to provide a source of energy (electricity). Radiation can be used to harden materials like polyethylene and petroleum, improving their properties for specific applications. In the food industry, controlled radiation exposure eliminates bacteria, extending shelf life and reducing spoilage. Smoke detectors often utilise radioactive materials like americium-241. These emit alpha particles that ionise the surrounding air. Smoke disrupts this ionisation, triggering an alarm when a change is detected. Overall, radioactive elements offer a diverse range of benefits in various industrial settings, from ensuring product quality and safety, to enhancing materials and preserving food. Agricultural applications: Radioactive isotopes contribute to various advancements in agriculture. They enable the development of new plant varieties with desirable characteristics through a process known as mutation breeding. These isotopes also serve as tracers, allowing scientists to study the efficiency of nutrient uptake by plants from fertilisers. Additionally, controlled radiation can be used for pest control by sterilising insects, protecting crops from destructive pests. Other applications: Radioactivity plays a key role in dating techniques used in archaeology and geology. Carbon dating, for example, utilises a radioactive isotope of carbon (carbon-14) absorbed by living organisms, to estimate the time elapsed since their death. By measuring the remaining carbon-14 and its known half-life, scientists can determine the age of fossils and other organic materials. Similarly, radioactive isotopes within rocks allow geologists to estimate the age of geological formations, providing valuable insights into Earth's history. Dangers of radiations: Radiation exposure poses significant health risks. Unlike easily blocked alpha particles, beta and gamma rays can penetrate the body, damaging tissues and leading to various health problems. This includes cellular destruction, which can cause radiation sickness, an increased risk of developing cancers like leukaemia, potential genetic mutations passed to future generations, skin damage like burns and redness, a weakened immune system less able to fight off infections, and even sterility (inability to reproduce) in both males and females. The severity of these dangers depends on the radiation dose and how long someone is exposed. Nature of nuclear decay. Nuclear decay, the transformation of unstable atomic nuclei into more stable forms, exhibits a fascinating interplay between spontaneity and randomness. Driven by inherent instability, these nuclei decay on their own (spontaneous), uninfluenced by external factors like temperature or pressure. However, the exact timing remains a matter of probability. While we can't predict when a single nucleus will decay, the concept of half-life, the time taken for half a sample to decay, allows us to predict the decay rate with remarkable accuracy. This seemingly paradoxical nature - spontaneous yet random - arises from the quantum world governing the nucleus, where processes occur probabilistically rather than with deterministic certainty. The inherent radioactivity of certain isotopes stems directly from the spontaneous nuclear decay of their unstable nuclei. This decay process releases energy in the form of emitted particles (alpha and beta) or photons (gamma rays). These emissions can further interact with matter, causing ionisation and other effects. Understanding these decay processes is crucial in fields like nuclear medicine, radioisotope dating, and radiation safety. Half-life. Some isotopes are indefinitely stable and do not decay. However, unstable radioactive isotopes undergo nuclear decay through characteristic forms of emission, and as time passes, less of the radioactive isotope remains. As decay occurs, the level of radioactivity decreases. The specific time interval/average time required for half of the quantity/mass of a substance to decay is known as its half-life. The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant, unaffected by any external conditions, and independent of the initial amount of that isotope. It is measured in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years, and it is different for different radioactive nuclides. Half-lives of some radioactive isotopes: Uranium-238 = 4500 million years, Uranium-235 = 704 million years, Plutonium-239 = 24 100 years, Carbon-14 = 5600 years, Strontium-90 = 29 years, Hydrogen-3 (Tritium) = 12 years, Cobalt-60 = 5.2 years, Technetium-99m = 6 hours, Radon-224 = 60 seconds, and Helium-5 = 1 x 10^-20 seconds. Example 1 - The decay of a sample of strontium-90. Strontium 90 has a half-life of 29 years. In 2012, a sample contains 18.2g of strontium 90. The mass of strontium 90 in the sample halves every 29 years. When will the mass have fall to 0.15g? Figure370.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_022.jpg. Question 1. At 10am in the morning, a radioactive sample contains 80g of a radioactive isotope. If the isotope has a half-life of 20 minutes, calculate the mass of the isotope remaining at 11am. 10am to 11am = 60 minutes = 3 x 20 minutes = 3 half-lives. Mass of isotope at 11 am = ½ x ½ x ½ x 80g = 10g. Question 2. Calculate the half-life of the radioactive isotope in a source if its mass decreases from 24g to 6g over a period of 60 days. 24g x ½ = 12g. 12g x ½ = 6g. Therefore, TWO half-lives occur in 60 days. Half-life = 30 days. Other ways of defining half-life: In terms of activity of a source: The half-life of a radioactive source is the average time taken for the activity of the source to decrease to half of its initial value. In terms of the number of nuclei: The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the average time it takes for half of the nuclei of the isotope to decay into some other isotope. Example 2 – The decay of source Z. Source Z decays with a half-life of three hours. At 9 am, the source has an activity of 16000 Bq. The activity halves every three hours. When will the activity have fallen to 125 Bq? Figure371.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_023.jpg. Example 3 – The decay of isotope X. Isotope X decays to Isotope Y with a half-life of 2 hours. At 2 pm there are 6400 nuclei of isotope X. When will the nuclei of isotope X fall to 25? Figure372.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_024.jpg. Question 3. A radioactive source has a half-life of 3 hours. At 8 am it has an activity of 600 Bq. What will be its activity at 2 pm? At 8 am activity = 600 Bq. 2 pm is 6 hours later, this is 2 half-lives later, therefore, the activity will halve twice, i.e., 600 → 300 → 150. Activity at 2 pm = 150 Bq. Question 1 – The decay of substance P. Substance P decays to substance Q with a half-life of 15 minutes. At 9 am there are 1280 nuclei of substance P. How many nuclei of substance X will be left at 11 am? Figure373.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_025.jpg. Question 4: A sample contains 8 billion nuclei of hydrogen-3 atoms. Hydrogen-3 has a half-life of 12 years. How many nuclei should remain after a period 48 years? 48 years = 4 x 12 years = 4 half-lives. Nuclei left = ½ x ½ x ½ x ½ x 8 billion = 500 million. Using formulae. If N₀ is the original value of a radioactive element and N(t) is the mass of a radioactive element at any time, t, then. Figure374.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_026.jpg. Figure375.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_027.jpg. Where T½ is the half-life of a radioactive element. Figure376.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_028.jpg. Examples: Radioactive element of mass 8g has half-life of 8days. Find: i) Mass of the element after 24days. ii) Mass decayed after 24days. Figure377.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_029.jpg. 2. A radioactive element of mass 9.6g has a mass of 0.15g after 24hours. Figure378.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_030.jpg. 3. A radioactive element of mass 12g has a half-life of 7years. Find the time taken for the element to decay to 0.75g (Ans-28yrs). Finding half-life from a graph: It is possible to find out the half-life of a radioactive substance from a graph of amount left against time. In order to determine the half-life of a radioactive substance using the graphical method, the following steps are taken. Draw a horizontal line from half the original amount (mass or count rate of nuclide) to meet the curve. Draw a vertical line from the point on the curve to meet the time axis. Read the value of half-life from where the vertical line meets the time axis. Figure379.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_031.jpg. The half-life in this example is about 30 seconds. A more accurate value can be obtained be repeating this method for other initial nuclei numbers and then taking an average. Sometimes, the original mass may not coincide with the zero time. In such a case, a suitable value of count rate or mass of nuclide is chosen. A horizontal line to meet the curve and then a vertical line from the point on the curve to meet the time axis are drawn. The time, t₁ is recorded. Another horizontal line from half of the chosen count rate or mass of nuclide, is drawn to meet the time axis. Another horizontal line from half of the chosen count rate or mass of nuclide to meet the curve and then a vertical line from that point on the curve to meet the time axis are also drawn. The time, t₂ is recorded. The half-life of the radioactive substance is then obtained from t½ = t₂-t₁. Question 1. Estimate the half-life of the substance whose decay graph is shown below. Figure380.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_032.jpg. Figure381.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_033.jpg. The half-life is approximately 20 seconds. Question 2: The mass of a radioactive substance over an 8-hour period is shown in the table below. Draw a graph of mass against time and use it to determine the half-life of the substance (The half-life should be about 2 hours). Figure382.4.6.nuclear_processes_image_034.jpg.

[Assignment 3] {Explore the social, political, and environmental dimensions associated with the use of nuclear power}. Nuclear reactions can release enormous amounts of energy, making them a powerful tool for energy generation and other applications (covered already). However, they are the most controversial energy sources we have. For some people, the potential risk associated with nuclear activity is too great. For others, nuclear looks like the answer for a zero-carbon future. Despite being hotly debated; countries are stepping up efforts towards using this energy. Most people upon hearing the word nuclear power, think only about something harmful or even deadly. However, during nuclear reactions, heat is generated. The heat generated is used to heat water to steam which runs turbines, generating electricity. This source of energy/power is called nuclear power. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. Nuclear fission is the primary process used in current nuclear power plants, with nuclear fusion being a technology under development. Effects of nuclear power. Nuclear power, while tempting for its clean electricity generation and minimal greenhouse gas emissions, presents a multifaceted challenge riddled with social, political, and environmental anxieties. Socially, the long-term burden of radioactive waste looms large. Uranium tailings and spent fuel rods remain hazardous for millennia, demanding secure, long-term storage solutions with significant economic and logistical hurdles. Furthermore, the potential for accidents, though mitigated by stringent regulations, can never be fully eradicated, fostering public anxieties and eroding trust. Politically, nuclear power ignites debates about national security. The technology's dual-use nature, where civilian applications can be adapted for military purposes, fuels anxieties about nuclear proliferation. Additionally, the centralised nature of nuclear power plants concentrates immense power in the hands of governments or large corporations. This raises concerns about energy security, potential manipulation of energy markets, and the democratic control of such a powerful technology. Finally, the environmental anxieties extend beyond the well-documented impacts of uranium mining. Thermal pollution from hot water discharge disrupts aquatic ecosystems, and the potential consequences of radiation leaks on surrounding environments add another layer of complexity. In conclusion, the future of nuclear power in the global energy mix hinges on finding solutions to these intricate social, political, and environmental challenges. Only through transparent communication, robust international cooperation, and a commitment to responsible waste management and safety measures, can nuclear power be considered a viable option in the fight against climate change.
