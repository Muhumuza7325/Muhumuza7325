Theme ***Structures of Substances*** "@OMD". TOPIC 12 ***PROPERTIES AND STRUCTURES OF SUBSTANCES*** “18 PERIODS”. Competency; The learner appreciates that in a chemical reaction, starting materials or reactants, interact to form products. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand the physical properties of giant molecular, giant ionic and giant metallic structures (k, u); b) Understand and appreciate how the properties of common materials relate to their uses; c) Know some common covalent reactions and carry out simple stoichiometric calculations using the mole concept on them (k, u). [Assignment 1] {Explain the differences in the physical properties of giant molecular, giant ionic and giant metallic structures}. Video30.Properties_of_Ionic_Substances.mp4. Video31.Giant_covalent_structures.mp4. Video32.Giant_Metallic_Structures.mp4. [Assignment 2] {Write down and interpret chemical equations for some common covalent reactions}. In our previous classes, we looked at how materials are used and also how properties of these materials are related to their uses. We saw that different materials are used for different purposes based on their properties. In this chapter, we shall exclusively use our previous knowledge from mainly the chapters of using materials, carbon in the environment and carbon in life to accomplish the different learning outcomes. • In groups or pairs: • Research and report on the physical properties of giant molecular, giant ionic and giant metallic structures and explain the differences in physical properties on a poster or presentation {Please refer to your notes on the chapter of structures and bonds (topic 10)}. • Write equations for common covalent reactions and show that some bonds are broken, and others are formed. A covalent reaction refers to a chemical reaction in which covalent bonds are formed or broken between atoms. Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electron pairs to achieve a more stable electron configuration. {Please refer to previous chapters and chapters ahead}. • Carry out simple stoichiometric calculations using the mole concept {Please revisit the chapter of formulae, stoichiometry and mole concept, and cover all the questions left unanswered, including those on covalent reactions, to the finest detail};
