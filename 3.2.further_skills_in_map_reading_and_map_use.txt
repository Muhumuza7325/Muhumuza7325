FURTHER USE OF MAPS; INTRODUCTION TO THE REST OF AFRICA. TOPICS 19 – 22: 54 PERIODS. Theme ***Further use of maps; introduction to the rest of Africa*** "@OMD". TOPIC 19 ***FURTHER SKILLS IN MAP READING AND MAP USE*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner uses large scale maps or ‘survey’ maps to find out about areas. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand what a contour is (u); b) use contours to describe the relief of an area (s); c) recognise physical and other features on conventional survey maps and photographs (s); d) use contours to show physical features on maps and draw cross- sections from simple contour maps (s); e) understand how to use a survey map to find out about the geography of an area (u); f) use survey maps to describe the relief, drainage, vegetation, farming, settlements, transport and other human activities of an area (s); g) use a sketch map to show the areas on a map (s, gs); h) appreciate the usefulness of survey maps in studying Geography (v, a, gs). Using contours • Explain that a contour is a line along which all places are of the same height. • go outside in an area with different kinds of slopes. Line up along a contour and another group also lines up along a contour above or below the first one to show what a contour is. • Choose an area of steep slopes and an area of gentler slopes. Stand on different contours. Explain that on gentle slopes, contours are close together while on a steep slope they are far apart. • Explore how contours are numbered. • Use a place with a small valley, hill and spur, or use a sand tray to show contours. • line up along contours, or mark on sand tray, contours around the hill, valley and spur to show the shape of these features on a contour map. • Use a very simple contour map showing steep and gentle slopes, valley, hill, spur, flat land and other relief features to ask questions to help to recognise the features. Describing an area from a survey map • Using survey maps, describe relief, drainage, vegetation, farming, settlement, transport and other human activities in an area, relate human features to physical features and to each other. • Working in pairs, practise using sketch maps to show certain areas and use maps in local area fieldwork. • describe the economic development of an area, using a survey map, including problems facing development and prospects for development. Use maps to explain other aspects of geography throughout the topics. Using a cross section • Using a survey map, demonstrate drawing a cross section. • practice drawing cross sections from survey maps. • mark human features along the cross section. • Explain, with examples, how cross sections can be used to describe areas and relate features of an area to height. • practise drawing cross sections and showing physical and human features on your drawings. • Compare hand-drawn landscape profiles with those that can be drawn digitally e.g., using Google Earth;
