TOPIC 4 ***Periodicity 1*** "33 PERIODS". Competency; The learner analyses the trends and periodic properties of elements, to explain and predict the reactivity and properties of elements in the Periodic table. SUB-TOPIC 4.1 ***The Periodic table*** "06 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) evaluate how the Periodic table is organised based on atomic number and properties, recognising its historical significance (u, s); b) analyse the position of elements to predict their chemical behaviour, considering periodic trends (u, s, v/a). a) watch a video or search for information on the historical development of the Periodic table (from Mendeleev’s design to Mosely’s atomic concept), discuss its organisation, and write group reports. b) In groups, use samples of the modern Periodic table to explore, discuss its organisation and respond to specific tasks such as identifying similarities in blocks, groups and periods (use the IUPAC form with 18 groups). a) In groups, use an inquiry-based approach to predict trends in properties such as reactivity based on element positions and make reports. b) engage in problem-solving tasks where you predict the reactivity of unknown elements based on the position of elements in the Periodic table. SUB-TOPIC 4.2 ***Variation in Trends of Properties Across Periods and the Diagonal Relationships*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the periodic physical and chemical properties in the Periodic table, identifying patterns and exceptions (u, s); b) justify the variation in physical and chemical properties across period 3, incorporating diagonal relationships (u, s v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the periodic physical properties of elements in the Periodic table (melting point, atomic radius, ionisation energy, electron affinity, electronegativity, electropositivity), discuss your findings in groups and make joint reports. b) apply the jigsaw method by working in groups, with each group focusing on one trend and teaching it to the rest of the class. c) In groups, use data sets of periodic trends (ionisation energy, electron affinity, atomic radius, ionic radius, electronegativity) to analyse and graph this data to infer relationships and patterns, identifying exceptions. a) individually search for information about the physical properties of period 3 elements (physical state, melting points, structure and bonding, metallic character), discuss your findings in groups and present reports. b) apply problem-based learning to analyse sets of data relating to the physical properties of elements in period 3. c) In groups, conduct laboratory activities where you observe chemical properties (reactivity with water, dilute acids and alkali) of elements like sodium, magnesium, and aluminium and sulphur. Record observations, draw inferences and present your reports. d) Individually, search for information about the oxides (structure and bonding, melting points, reaction with dilute acids, alkalis and water) and chlorides (structure and bonding, melting points, reaction with dilute acids, alkalis and water) of period 3 elements, discuss your findings in groups and present reports. e) In groups, carry out test tube experiments to identify magnesium and aluminium ions. f) Individually, search for information about diagonal relationships between lithium and magnesium and also between beryllium and aluminium. SUB-TOPIC 4.3 ***Trends in Properties of Group 2 Elements*** "9 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to investigate the reactivity and properties of Group 2 elements and their compounds in relation to their applications in industry (s, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the physical properties (melting point, metallic radii and density) of Group 2 elements, discuss your findings in groups and make reports. b) In pairs, use problem-based learning to interpret data on the physical properties of Group 2 elements. c) In groups, carry out experiments to investigate the reactivity of Group 2 metals with air, water and dilute acids. d) In groups, carry out laboratory experiments to investigate solubility, effect of heat and action of dilute acids on compounds of Group 2 (hydroxides, sulphates, nitrates and carbonates). e) In pairs, carry out test tube experiments to identify ions in Group 2 compounds (Ca²⁺, Ba²⁺, CO₃²⁻, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻,NO₃⁻). f) Individually, search for information on the applications of Group 2 elements and their compounds, discuss your findings in groups and make presentations. g) In groups, carry out projects to make different industrial products from Group 2 compounds;
