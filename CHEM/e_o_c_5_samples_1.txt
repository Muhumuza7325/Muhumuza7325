This involved mixing sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. During the training, a participant was randomly picked and instructed to add a prepared solution of an acid to a base solution in a container. The participant noted that the container became warmer as he kept on adding the acid. He could not understand why and how much heat had been generated. Sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid according to the following equation. NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l) + Heat. The heat produced varies with the volume of acid added to the base. The acid provided is labeled BA1 and the base provided is labeled BA2. Task:#(a) As a learner of chemistry; (i) Design an experiment you will carry out to determine the amount of heat, produced during the reaction between BA1 and BA2 or produced when BA1 is added to BA2. (ii) Carry out the experiment and record your findings. (iii) Obtain the maximum heat produced during the reaction.#(b) What can the participant deduce from your findings?#a) (i) A.

PROCEDURE OF EXPERIMENT WITH RELEVANT MATERIALS (03 scores):#20/25cm³ of BA2 is pipetted into a plastic beaker and its initial temperature noted and recorded. The initial temperature of BA1 is also noted and recorded and then filled into a burette and adjusted to the zero mark. BA1 is added to BA2 in the beaker at uniform intervals of 5cm³/10cm³ each time stirring and noting the highest temperature of the mixture for seven readings upto 35cm³/40cm³/50cm³.#E. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS (02 scores): – Swallowing of the base during pipetting. Mitigation: Use a pipette sucker or filler. Or stop sucking in as soon as solution goes past the mark. – Acid pouring on the skin or question paper. Mitigation: Put on a lab coat, gloves, closed shoes. Dry the working table as soon as it is wetted by the chemical. Clean the thermometer before using it in another solution to ensure no reaction occurs before mixing the two solutions. Handle glass ware with care to avoid accidents and breakages. – Blockage of burette. Mitigation: Pipetting the base inside of acid to avoid blockages in the burette when the base reacts with carbon dioxide forming sodium carbonate. – Breakage of thermometer. Mitigation: Putting back the thermometer in its case/container after use. – Spilling solutions on table. Mitigation: Use a filter funnel for filling the funnel.#F. PRESENTATION OF DATA (04 scores).

DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION/CREATING MEANING (03 scores):#A graph of highest temperature against volume of BA1 added was plotted as shown on graph paper. Heat evolved by reaction = Heat gained by mixture = mc∆T.#Graph 1, (G1): #Figure341.545_2_NLSC_Sample_24_Guide_image_002.jpg#Heat evolved = (20+25)x4.2x(36.5–28.0) = –1,606.5Jmol⁻¹.#Graph 2, (G2): #Figure342.545_2_NLSC_Sample_24_Guide_image_003.jpg#Heat evolved = (20+25)x4.2x(37.0–27.5) = –1,795.5Jmol⁻¹.#Graph 3, (G3): #Figure343.545_2_NLSC_Sample_24_Guide_image_004.jpg#Heat evolved = (20+15)x4.2x(36.0–27.0) = –1,323Jmol⁻¹.#Graph 4, (G4): #Figure344.545_2_NLSC_Sample_24_Guide_image_005.jpg#Heat evolved = (20+20)x4.2x(35.5–26.0) = –1,596Jmol⁻¹.#b) I. CONCLUSION: Heat is evolved when sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid. The maximum heat evolved when 25cm³ of sodium hydroxide is mixed with 20cm³ of hydrochloric acid is 1606.5Jmol⁻¹. While the calculated value is positive (indicating heat absorption based on the convention used), the magnitude is significantly smaller than the expected exothermic heat for a strong acid-strong base reaction. This suggests an underestimation of the actual heat released, likely due to factors such as heat loss to the surroundings, incomplete neutralisation because of limiting base concentration, potential variations in specific heat capacity, and minor measurement errors.#ALTERNATIVE METHOD: PROCEDURE OF EXPERIMENT (VARIABLES INTERCHANGED).#a) All the BA1 provided (50cm³) was diluted by adding an equal volume of water (50cm³) to form 100cm³ of solution. The resultant solution was labelled BA3. Its initial temperature is noted. (b) 20cm³ of BA3 was measured using a measuring cylinder into a plastic beaker followed by 5cm³ of BA2 and the mixture stirred. The highest temperature of the mixture is noted and recorded. (c) Procedure (b) is repeated for values of BA2 equal to 10, 15, 20 and 25cm³. The results are then entered in the table below. #RECORDING OF DATA. #sample_prac_uneb_5.jpg.#A graph of highest temperature against volume of BA2 added is plotted.#sample_prac_uneb_6.jpg.# Figure345.545_2_NLSC_Sample_24_Guide_image_006.jpg.#DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION / CREATING MEANING: Heat evolved by reaction = Heat gained by mixture = mc∆T = (50x1x4.2x(37–25.5)) = -2,415Jmol⁻¹. The alternative method with a diluted acid solution can still be used to determine the heat of neutralization. However, due to the dilution, the expected heat change might be smaller compared to using the undiluted acid. It's important to account for this dilution factor when interpreting the results and comparing them to the expected value for a strong acid-strong base reaction (around -57.3 kJ/mol).
