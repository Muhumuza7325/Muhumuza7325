Qn. In an experiment to investigate the rate of diffusion of lighter and heavier gases using a glass tube with a piece of cotton wool dipped in concentrated hydrochloric acid and another piece of cotton wool dipped in concentrated ammonia at opposite ends, John noted a ring form in the glass tube. However, the ring did not appear immediately and to John's surprise, the white ring never formed at the center of the glass tube. Assuming you were John, explain your observations and advise Peter who is planning to make a balloon, on which of the two gases from the experiment he should use (3 scores);
Qn. For numerous reasons, pure substances are often preferred when carrying out chemical reactions in the laboratory. The purity of a substance can be tested in many ways that  include determining the boiling point of the substance. As, a friend to David, who understands the criteria for determining the purity of a substance using its boiling point, explain the effect of impurities on the boiling point of ethanol and write to David detailing how he should determine the purity of ethanol he is planning to use in one of his chemistry experiments (10 scores);
Qn. To clearly understand the behaviour of particles in the different states of matter, students are planning to explore the kinetic theory of matter. They plan to conduct experiments to observe the arrangement of particles, the forces between them, and their movement. Their goal is to understand how these factors relate to the physical properties of solids, liquids, and gases.
You have been appointed by the chemistry teacher to sensitize these learners.
