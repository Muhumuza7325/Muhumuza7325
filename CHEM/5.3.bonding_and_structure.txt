TOPIC 3 ***Bonding and Structure*** "30 PERIODS". Competency; The learner analyses the types of chemical bonds and molecular structures, and relates them to the properties and uses of substances in real-life contexts. SUB-TOPIC 3.1 ***Formation of Ionic and Metallic Bonds*** "12 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) justify the formation of ionic and metallic bonds based on electron transfer and electrostatic forces (u, s); b) evaluate the properties of ionic and metallic compounds in relation to bond strength and structural composition (u). a) In groups, use prior knowledge to design models illustrating electron transfer in ionic bonding and electron pooling in metallic bonding. a) Individually, search for information about the properties of ionic and metallic bonds, their relative strengths, and how they relate to their properties, discuss in your groups, and make presentations. SUB-TOPIC 3.2 ***Covalent Bonds and Molecular Structures*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the formation of covalent bonds including dative covalency and explain molecular structures by applying VSEPR theory to predict molecular shapes and bond angles (u, s); b) analyse the polarity of molecules based on molecular structure and electron distribution (u). a) Individually, search for information about covalent bonding, dative covalency, and the principles of VSEPR theory, discuss your findings in groups, and make presentations. b) In groups, predict, draw shapes of molecules and ions, and build 3D molecular models based on VSEPR theory. a) Individually, search for information about the bond and molecular polarity in relation to differences in electronegativity with emphasis on hydrogen bonding and Van der Waalâ€™s forces, discuss your findings in your groups, and make reports. b) In pairs, use problem-based methods to carry out exercises involving different molecular structures and their properties and make reports;
