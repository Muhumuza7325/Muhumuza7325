TOPIC 6 ***Organic Chemistry I*** "57 PERIODS". Competency; The learner analyses the structures, functional groups, and reactivity of organic compounds, and applies knowledge of organic reactions and organic reaction mechanisms to synthesise organic molecules. SUB-TOPIC 6.1 ***Introduction to Organic Compounds*** "15 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) apply principles of organic chemistry to understand the classification and general characteristics of organic compounds, including functional groups, homologous series, and the concept of isomerism (k, u); b) use IUPAC nomenclature to name different organic compounds (u, s). a) Individually, search for information about the unique nature of carbon in organic compounds, such as how single, double, and triple bonds are formed, and engage in a teacher-led discussion. b) In groups, use molecular models to demonstrate functional groups and homologous series (CnH2n+2, CnH2n, CnH2n-2). c) In groups, use models to illustrate different types of isomers and create models of isomers for a given molecular formula and display your work. d) In groups, engage in a teacher-guided discussion to explain the different properties of isomers. a) In pairs, practise naming and drawing organic molecules following IUPAC rules. b) In groups, analyse molecular structures to identify functional groups. c) Individually, carry out problem-solving exercises involving structure prediction based on functional groups. SUB-TOPIC 6.2 ***Alkanes, Alkenes and Alkynes*** "15 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) apply principles of organic chemistry to differentiate between alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, and explain their physical properties based on molecular structure (k, u); b) predict the reactivity and reaction mechanisms of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes (s). a) Individually, search for information about the physical properties of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, discuss your findings in groups, and make reports. b) In groups, use molecular models to demonstrate bonding and structure in hydrocarbons. c) In groups, carry out laboratory experiments to observe the physical properties of the various functional groups of hydrocarbons (e.g., solubility, melting point). a) Individually, search for information about the reactivity and reaction mechanisms of alkanes (UV-catalysed chlorination), alkenes (hydrogen, hydrogen halides, acidified water, halogens), polymerisation and oxidation using potassium manganate (VII), discuss your findings in your groups and make reports. (NB: Addition reactions of alkenes are similar to those of alkynes). b) In pairs, carry out test tube reactions to identify the double bond in alkenes using bromine water and potassium manganate (VII). c) In pairs, practise the writing of reactions and their mechanisms using worksheets. d) In groups, use case studies to explore the different applications of alkenes and alkynes in everyday life and make reports. SUB-TOPIC 6.3 ***Halogen Compounds (Alkyl Halides)*** "12 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the structure and properties of alkyl halides in terms of their reactivity with different reagents, identifying substitution and elimination reactions (k, u, s); b) evaluate the uses and impacts of alkyl halides in industrial processes (u, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the structure, nomenclature, and physical properties of alkyl halides, discuss your findings in groups, and make reports. b) Individually, search for information about the chemical properties of alkyl halides with different reagents (alkali, cyanide, ammonia, alcoholic alkali, reaction with metals), including synthesis, discuss your findings in your groups and make reports. c) In groups, create a visual map comparing substitution and elimination mechanisms, including key factors (e.g., reagents, solvents, temperature). a) In groups, analyse case studies involving the role of alkyl halides in industry, including environmental impacts, and discuss and make presentations.

Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) compare benzene and methyl benzene in terms of structure, stability, and reactivity in electrophilic substitution reactions (k, u, s); b) analyse the environmental and health impacts of benzene derivatives (u, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the structures of benzene, and methylbenzene in terms of their stability and reactivity. Discuss your findings in groups and make reports. b) In groups, discuss the difference between electrophilic substitution reactions involving benzene and methyl benzene, and make a report. c) In pairs, practice writing equations and mechanisms of electrophilic substitution reactions involving benzene and methylbenzene. a) In groups, analyse case studies involving the effects of benzene derivatives on health and the environment and discuss and present written reports;
