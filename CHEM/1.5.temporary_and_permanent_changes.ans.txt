Is it true that physical changes occur when new chemical substances are formed?; 
Is it true that matter undergoes several changes classified as physical/non-permanent/temporary/reversible or chemical/permanent/irreversible changes?;
For a physical change, the products have the same chemical properties as the reactants. Examples of physical changes include: Melting of candle wax, Melting of ice, Sublimation of iodine crystals, Sublimation of zinc chloride. Are all the statements true?;
Chemical changes occur when new chemical substances are formed. The products have chemical properties different from those of the reactants. Examples of chemical changes include: Burning of wood, papers or grass and heating of potassium permanganate crystals. Changes in the colour of substances could be as a result of either a physical or chemical change. Are all the statements true?;
Boiling and condensing water, heating and cooling candle wax, sublimation of iodine, breaking a wooden stick, melting of ice, boiling an egg, dissolving salt in water, and rusting an iron nail, are all examples of physical changes. Are all the examples right?;
