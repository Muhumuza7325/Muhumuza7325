Competency; The learner understands oxidation and reduction in terms of gain or loss of oxygen and in terms of electron transfer, and he/she appreciates that the two processes always occur together. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand the processes of oxidation and reduction and their importance in the chemical industry (u, s); b) Explain redox reactions in terms of electron transfer (u); c) Understand the changes that take place during the electrolysis of some compounds (u, s). [Assignment 1] {Explain the processes of oxidation and reduction}. In regard to our day-to-day life, food materials such as glucose undergo oxidation to generate energy. Oxidation accounts for the colour changes in fleshy fruits when cut. Hydrogen peroxide used as an anti-septic on minor cuts and burns of the skin to prevent infection, relies on an oxidation reaction. Oxidation can be seen as the gain of oxygen, the loss of hydrogen, the loss of electrons or the increase in oxidation number of a substance. The reverse occurs in reduction. Reduction can be seen as the loss of oxygen, the gain of hydrogen, the gain of electrons or the decrease in oxidation number of a substance. Calculating oxidation numbers. In chemistry, the oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to other atoms were fully ionic. This allows us to track electron transfers during reactions. An element has an oxidation state of 0, regardless of whether it is found as individual atoms or in molecules. For example, neon (Ne) and chlorine (Cl₂) have oxidation states of 0. The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero, balancing the positive and negative charges. In simple ions, the oxidation number matches the charge on the ion. For example, a magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) and an oxide ion (O²⁻) have oxidation states of +2 and -2 respectively. For a polyatomic ion, the sum of oxidation numbers of all atoms is equal to its charge. Some elements have fixed oxidation numbers in compounds. Group I elements typically have a +1 oxidation state, while Group VII elements usually have an oxidation state of -1 in their compounds. Oxygen is another common element that generally has an oxidation state of -2 in most compounds, and hydrogen often has an oxidation state of +1. Note that there are exceptions. For instance, chlorine can have other oxidation states besides -1, such as +1 in the compound hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Calculate or determine the oxidation numbers of stated elements in the following; i) S in SO₂; SO₂ = 0; S + (-2x2) = 0; S - 4 = 0; S = +4; ii) S in SO₃, SO₃ = 0; S + (-2x3) = 0; S - 6 = 0; S = +6; iii) H in H₂O; H₂O = 0; (2xH) + -2 = 0; 2H - 2 = 0; H = +1; iv) Mn in MnO₄⁻; MnO₄⁻ = -1; Mn + (-2x4) = -1; Mn - 8 = -1; Mn = +7; v) Nitrogen in Nitrate, +5; vi) Manganese in Manganese (IV) Oxide, +4; Individually, calculate or determine the oxidation numbers of the stated elements in the following; i) Sulphur in the Sulphite ion; ii) Hydrogen in Hydrochloric acid; iii) Phosphorous in phosphate; iv) Carbon in Carbon dioxide; v) Carbon in carbon monoxide; vi) Sulphur in Sulphur dioxide; vii) Oxygen in Hydroxyl ion; viii) Chromium in Dichromate ion; ix) Copper in Copper (II) oxide. Oxidising and Reducing Agents. An oxidizing agent is a substance that causes another substance to be oxidized. It achieves this by accepting electrons, gaining oxygen, or removing hydrogen from the substance being oxidized. In the process, the oxidizing agent itself undergoes reduction, meaning it gains electrons, loses oxygen, or gains hydrogen. A reducing agent is a substance that causes another substance to be reduced. It achieves this by donating electrons, losing oxygen, or gaining hydrogen. In the process, the reducing agent itself undergoes oxidation, meaning it loses electrons, gains oxygen, or loses hydrogen. Examples. 3CuO(s) + 2NH₃(g) → 3Cu(s) + N₂(g) + 3H₂O(l); CuO is an oxidizing agent and NH₃ is a reducing agent. PbO(s) + H₂(g) → Pb(s) + H₂O(l); PbO is an oxidizing agent and H₂ is a reducing agent. 2H₂S(g) + SO₂(g) → 3S(s) + 2H₂O(l); H₂S is a reducing agent and SO₂ is an oxidizing agent. In groups, research, explain and report on the terms: ‘oxidation’ and ‘reduction’ in terms of: loss or gain of oxygen; loss or gain of hydrogen; transfer of electrons and change in oxidation number; Individually, then calculate the oxidation number of an element in a compound. [Assignment 2] {Explain redox reactions in terms of electron transfer}. Redox reactions are reactions in which reduction and oxidation take place simultaneously (occur at the same time). Metals, with their lower electronegativity / being more electropositive, tend to lose electrons (oxidation) and act as reducing agents. In contrast, nonmetals, being more electronegative, have a high tendency to gain electrons (reduction) and act as oxidizing agents. This is perfectly shown in the reaction between sodium and chlorine. 2Na⁰ (s) + Cl₂⁰(g) + heat → 2Na⁺Cl⁻(aq). Figure88.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_001.jpg. Note that while electronegativity is a useful tool to predict the general tendency of elements to gain or lose electrons, specific factors like ionisation energies and reaction conditions can influence the elements' actual behaviour in a redox reaction. Rules in writing ionic equations. 1) Start with a balanced molecular equation. A molecular equation is one that shows the chemical formulas of all reactants and products but does not explicitly indicate their ionic nature. For example, 2Na₃PO₄(aq) + 3CaCl₂(aq) → 6NaCl(aq) + Ca₃(PO₄)₂(s). 2) Break all soluble strong electrolytes (compounds with (aq) beside them) into their ions [Indicate the correct formula and charge of each ion, indicate the correct number of each ion, write (aq) after each ion]. 3) Bring down all compounds with (s), (l), or (g) unchanged. 6Na⁺(aq) + 2PO₄³⁻(aq) + 3Ca²⁺(aq) + 6Cl⁻(aq) → 6Na⁺(aq) + 6Cl⁻(aq) + Ca₃(PO₄)₂(s). 2PO₄³⁻(aq) + 3Ca²⁺(aq) → Ca₃(PO₄)₂(s). How was this equation obtained? Consider each reactant or product separately: 1 mole of Na₃PO₄ contains 3 moles of Na⁺ and 1 mole of PO₄³⁻. Since the balanced equation shows that two moles of sodium phosphate are involved in the reaction, a total of 6 moles (2 x 3) of Na⁺ and 2 moles (2 x 1) of PO₄³⁻ are formed. Notice that the subscript "4" in the formula for the phosphate ion is not used when determining the number of phosphate ions present. That particular subscript is part of the formula for the phosphate ion itself. 2Na₃PO₄(aq) → 6Na⁺(aq) + 2PO₄³⁻(aq). 1 mole of CaCl₂ contains 1 mole of Ca²⁺ and 2 moles of Cl⁻. Remember, the subscript "2" indicates the number of chloride ions. Cl₂ is elemental chlorine. You will never have a diatomic chlorine ion (i.e., Cl²⁻ or Cl₂²⁻) in an aqueous solution. Since the balanced equation shows that 3 moles of calcium chloride are involved in the reaction. 3CaCl₂(aq) → 3Ca²⁺(aq) + 6Cl⁻(aq). 1 mole of NaCl contains 1 mole of Na⁺ and 1 mole of Cl⁻. Since the balanced equation shows that 6 moles of NaCl are produced by the reaction. 6NaCl(aq) → 6Na⁺(aq) + 6Cl⁻(aq). Since calcium phosphate is an insoluble solid (indicated by the (s) beside its formula), it will not form appreciable amounts of ions in water. It is brought down unchanged into the complete ionic equation. 4) Cross out the spectator ions that are present. Spectator ions are ions that are present in the reaction mixture but do not participate in it. They "sit around and watch the reaction take place" just like a spectator at a football game watches the players in the game but doesn't play the game himself. You can recognize spectator ions by looking for ions that are present on both sides of the equation. They will always have the same exact formula, charge, and physical state. They will also be present in exactly the same number on both sides of the equation. 6Na⁺(aq) + 2PO₄³⁻(aq) + 3Ca²⁺(aq) + 6Cl⁻(aq) → 6Na⁺(aq) + 6Cl⁻(aq) + Ca₃(PO₄)₂(s). 5) Write the "leftovers" as the net ionic equation. 2PO₄³⁻(aq) + 3Ca²⁺(aq) → Ca₃(PO₄)₂(s). 3Ca²⁺(aq) + 2PO₄³⁻(aq) → Ca₃(PO₄)₂(s). The ions that appear in the final net ionic equations are called participants as they are the ones that are actively involved in the reaction. Example 1: The precipitation of an insoluble salt. (a) When silver nitrate solution is added to potassium chloride solution, a white precipitate is formed. Write the ionic equation for the word equation, Sodium chloride(aq) + silver nitrate(aq) → silver chloride(s) + sodium nitrate(aq). Write the equation and balance it. Split the ions (Only compounds that are aqueous are split into ions). Cancel out spectator ions. Write a balanced ionic equation. AgNO₃(aq) + KCl(aq) → KNO₃(aq) + AgCl(s). Ag⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq) + K⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → K⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq) + AgCl(s). Ionic equation: Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s). (b) When barium nitrate solution is added to copper (II) sulphate solution, a white precipitate is formed. Ba(NO₃)₂(aq) + CuSO₄(aq) → BaSO₄(s) + Cu(NO₃)₂(aq). Ba²⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq) + Cu²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq). Ionic equation: Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s). (c) When a solution of sodium hydroxide is added to a solution of zinc sulphate, a white precipitate is formed. ZnSO₄(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Zn(OH)₂(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq). Zn²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + 2Na⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Zn(OH)₂(s) + 2Na⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq). Ionic equation: Zn²⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Zn(OH)₂(s). (d) When sodium iodide solution is added to lead (II) nitrate solution, a yellow precipitate is formed. Pb(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2NaI(aq) → PbI₂(s) + 2NaNO₃(aq). Pb²⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq) + 2Na⁺(aq) + 2I⁻(aq) → PbI₂(s) + 2Na⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq). Ionic equation: Pb²⁺(aq) + 2I⁻(aq) → PbI₂(s). Example 2: Ionic equations for the reaction between an acid with a metal. When dilute sulphuric acid is added to zinc granules, hydrogen gas is evolved. Copper (II) sulphate solution may be added to speed up the reaction. Zn(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Zn(s) + 2H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + H₂(g). Ionic equation: Zn(s) + 2H⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + H₂(g). Write the ionic equation for the word equation, Sodium(s) + hydrochloric acid(aq) → sodium chloride(aq) + hydrogen(g). 2Na(s) + 2H⁺(aq) → 2Na⁺(aq) + H₂(g). Example 3: Single displacement redox reactions. The reactivity series is a ranking of metals based on their tendency to lose electrons. Metals higher in the series are more reactive and can displace metals lower in the series from their ionic compounds (salts) in solution. This displacement occurs most readily when there's a significant difference in reactivity between the two metals. In these reactions, the more reactive metals act as reducing agents/electron donors, and their reducing power generally decreases down the series. a) Addition of zinc powder to copper (II) sulphate solution. Observation: The blue solution turns colourless and a brown solid is formed. Zinc is higher than copper in the reactivity series and thus displaces copper from its solution to form brown copper and a colourless zinc sulphate solution. Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s). Ionic equation: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation). Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction). Overall equation: Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s) (redox). b) Addition of iron filings to copper (II) sulphate solution. Observation: The blue copper (II) sulphate solution turns green and a brown solid is formed. Iron is higher than copper in the reactivity series and displaces copper from blue copper (II) sulphate solution to form brown copper and green iron (II) sulphate solution. CuSO₄(aq) + Fe(s) → FeSO₄(aq) + Cu(s). Ionic equation: Fe(s) → Fe²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation). Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction). Overall equation: Fe(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Fe²⁺(aq) + Cu(s). Example 4: Ionic equations involving solids. When dilute nitric acid is added to lead carbonate, aqueous Lead (II) nitrate, carbon dioxide and water are formed. PbCO₃(s) + 2HNO₃(aq) → Pb(NO₃)₂(aq) + CO₂(g) + H₂O (l). PbCO₃(s) + 2H⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq) → Pb²⁺(aq) + 2NO₃⁻(aq) + CO₂(s) + H₂O(l). PbCO₃(s) + 2H⁺(aq) → Pb²⁺(aq) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(l). Ionic equations for neutralization reactions. Alkali + acid → Salt + Water. NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l). Na⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) + H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) + H₂O(l). Ionic equation: OH⁻(aq) + H⁺(aq) → H₂O(l). Acid + basic oxide → salt + water. CuO(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → CuSO₄(s) + H₂O(l). CuO(s) + 2H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + H₂O(l). Ionic equation: CuO(s) + 2H⁺(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + H₂O(l). 6) Ionic equation for the reaction between a metal carbonate and dilute acids. Na₂CO₃(aq) + H₂SO₄(aq) → Na₂SO₄(aq) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(l). 2Na⁺(aq) + CO₃²⁻(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → 2Na⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(l). Ionic equation: CO₃²⁻(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l). Displacement reactions of halogens. Halogens are displaced from their solutions by other halogens which are higher in the electro chemical series [more reactive halogens]. The order of reactivity of halogens is Fluorine > Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine > Astatine [This follows their order in the periodic table]. For example, when chlorine gas is passed through an aqueous colourless solution of potassium iodide, a brown colouration develops immediately. The brown colouration is due to iodine liberated as iodide ions are displaced by chlorine from solution. Cl₂(g) + 2KI(aq) → 2KCl(aq) + I₂(aq). Cl₂(g) + 2I⁻(aq) → 2Cl⁻(aq) + I₂(aq). Chlorine in this case acts as the oxidizing agent. The presence of an oxidising agent can be tested using potassium iodide (KI) solution. Iodide ions (I⁻) are oxidised to form iodine (I₂) when an oxidising agent is present. The solution turns from colourless to brown. 2I⁻(aq) [colourless] → I₂(aq) [brown] + 2e⁻. The presence of a reducing agent can be tested using acidified potassium manganate (VII) [KMnO₄] solution (Also known as Potassium permanganate). Manganate (VII) ions are reduced to manganese (II) ions in the presence of a reducing agent. The solution turns from purple to colourless. MnO₄⁻(aq) [Purple] + 8H⁺(aq) + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺(aq) [Colourless] + 4H₂O(l). Acidified potassium dichromate (VI) solution can also be used to test for the presence of reducing agents. Dichromate (VI) ions (Cr₂O₇²⁻) are reduced to form chromium (III) (Cr³⁺) ions. The solution turns from orange to green. Cr₂O₇²⁻(aq) [orange] + 14H⁺(aq) + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺(aq) [Green] + 7H₂O(l).

Applications of reduction and oxidation reactions. Redox reactions are fundamental across various fields. They power metal extraction and purification (electrolysis), drive electrochemical cells (batteries, fuel cells), and are involved in everyday processes like corrosion and combustion. Redox reactions are crucial in biology for photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and understanding them enables us prevent food spoilage and develop preservation methods. For this very chapter, only electrolysis and electrochemical cells shall be covered in detail. Metal extraction shall be covered in the next chapter of industrial processes. [Assignment 3] {Explain in detail, the changes that take place during the electrolysis of some compounds}. Effects of an electric current on substances. Electricity is a form of energy produced by the flow of electrons through materials. Electrolysis is a process that uses direct current (DC) to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction, breaking apart a substance in solution or molten form into new substances. This reaction involves the decomposition of a substance, called the electrolyte, which can be in either a molten state (liquid due to high temperature) or a dissolved state (in a solution). During electrolysis, the electrolyte breaks down at the electrodes (anode and cathode), where the electrical current enters and exits the solution. Definitions of common terms used in electrolysis. 1) Electrolyte: A compound which, when dissolved in a solution or melted, conducts electricity due to the presence of mobile ions and can be decomposed by an electric current. Types of electrolytes. (a) Strong electrolytes: These are electrolytes which ionise completely in solution. Examples: Salts - NaCl, KCl, MgSO₄. Mineral acids – HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃. Caustic alkalis – NaOH, KOH. Please try out ionization reactions of the above examples. (b) Weak electrolytes: These electrolytes ionize only partially in solution, establishing an equilibrium between molecules and ions. The solution contains a mixture of both. The electric current can decompose only a small portion of the weak electrolyte. Examples: Weak Alkalis: Ammonia solution (NH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) ↔ NH₄⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)). Most Organic Acids: Ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH(aq) ↔ CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H⁺(aq)). Impure Water (H₂O(l) ↔ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)) (Water itself is a very weak electrolyte). 2) Non-electrolytes: Non-electrolytes are substances that exist only as molecules and are not capable of significant ionisation in solution or molten form. These substances generally do not conduct electricity and are not decomposed at the electrodes during electrolysis. Examples: Most covalent compounds like pure ethanol, benzene, methyl benzene, petrol, sugar and diesel. It's important to note that very pure water can exhibit a small degree of self-ionization, but for most practical purposes, it's considered a non-electrolyte. Investigation of electrical conductivity of liquid solutions. Examples: Ethanol, urea, hydrochloric acid, copper (II) sulphate, ethanoic acid, water, ammonium hydroxide. Procedure: Fill the electrolytic cell with the chosen liquid solution. Dip two inert electrodes (made of metal or graphite) into the solution. Connect the electrodes to a bulb using a conductor wire and a switch. Finally, connect the circuit to the power source (batteries). Figure131.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_002.jpg. Close the switch. Observe the bulb for brightness. Repeat steps 1-5 with each liquid solution. Results: The brightness of the bulb observed in each solution indicates its conductivity. When ethanol and urea were used, there was no light produced, indicating that they do not conduct electricity, and are therefore called non electrolytes. When ammonium hydroxide and ethanoic acid were used, the bulb produced a dim light, indicating that they weakly conduct electricity and are therefore weak electrolytes. When copper (II) sulphate solution and hydrochloric acid were used, the bulb produced bright light, indicating that they strongly conduct electricity and are therefore strong electrolytes. 3) Conductors: Materials, like copper wire, allow electricity to flow easily. Some, like zinc wire and graphite, can also conduct electricity under certain conditions. Investigation of electrical conductivity through solid materials. The figure below shows a circuit with a battery, a bulb, and a switch connected by a copper wire. Figure130.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_001.jpg. When the switch is closed, the circuit is complete. Electrons flow from the battery through the copper wire to the bulb, causing it to light up. The returning path for the electrons is through the other wire connected to the battery. Copper and zinc wires conduct electricity and they are called conductors. So, what is a conductor? A conductor is a substance in solid form which can conduct electricity. Examples include most metals and graphite (the only nonmetal that can conduct electricity). Metals conduct electricity because they have delocalized, free or mobile electrons. Differences between a conductor and an electrolyte. [Conductor] [Electrolyte]. A conductor conducts electricity through movement of electrons. An electrolyte, which is often an ionic compound, conducts electricity through the movement of ions. A conductor is not decomposed by electric current. An electrolyte, typically an ionic compound, is decomposed by passage of an electric current. Conductors are mainly metallic solids except graphite. Electrolytes are mainly ionic compounds. Please note that plasma, a high-temperature ionized gas, can also conduct electricity due to the presence of free electrons and ions. 4) Nonconductors (insulators): When the above experiment is repeated using rubber and plastics, the bulb doesn’t light, indicating that they do not conduct electricity and are referred to as insulators or nonconductors. Therefore, a nonconductor/insulator is a substance in solid form that does not conduct electricity. Examples of insulators are most nonmetals except a few, like graphite. They are used for: Electrical appliance handles: They prevent current from flowing through the handle to your hand when you touch an appliance. Power cable and telephone line coverings: They insulate the wires, preventing current leakage and potential shocks. The insulating ability of materials arises from the lack of mobile charge carriers within their structure. Unlike conductors (which have free electrons) or electrolytes (which have mobile ions), insulators have tightly bound electrons that cannot move freely. This hinders the flow of electric current. Semiconductors are a special case. They are materials that have conductivity somewhere between conductors and insulators. Their conductivity can be significantly influenced by factors like doping (adding impurities) and temperature. This unique property makes semiconductors crucial for many electronic devices, such as transistors and integrated circuits. 5) Electrodes: Electrodes are two conductors, typically made of graphite or metal, that serve as entry and exit points for electricity in an electrolytic cell. They come into direct contact with the electrolyte solution. The anode is the positively charged electrode where electron flow occurs outwards, towards the electrolyte solution. The cathode is the negatively charged electrode where electrons are received from the electrolyte solution. The 2 electrodes (anode and cathode) are immersed in the electrolyte solution. Below is a simple electrolytic cell. Figure132.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_003.jpg. In a typical electrolytic cell setup, the anode is connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and the cathode is connected to the negative terminal. This connection establishes the flow of electrons through the circuit and into the electrolytic cell. The anode is typically represented by the long line symbolising the positive current source, while the cathode is represented by the short line signifying the negative terminal. In an electrolytic cell, the electrolyte has to be in solution form or molten state as the ions have to be free to move so as to conduct electricity. Salts like sodium chloride (NaCl) and lead (II) bromide (PbBr₂) do not conduct electricity in their solid state because the strong electrostatic forces of attraction hold the ions tightly packed in a crystal lattice. However, when these salts are melted or dissolved in water, the crystal structure breaks down. The ions become solvated (surrounded by water molecules) and mobile, allowing them to move freely within the solution. This movement of ions is crucial for conducting electricity in the electrolyte solution. 6) External circuit: The external circuit plays a crucial role in enabling electrolysis within an electrolytic cell. It comprises of the following components: a) External Wire: This wire connects the anode and cathode of the electrolytic cell. It provides a pathway for the flow of electrons between the electrodes. b) Power Source: An external power source, typically a battery, supplies the electrical energy needed for electrolysis. It establishes a potential difference (voltage) between the anode and cathode, driving the flow of electrons. c) Optional Components: Depending on the specific setup, the external circuit might include additional elements like: i) Switch: This allows for controlling the flow of current in the circuit and turning electrolysis on or off. ii) Bulb: A bulb connected in series with the circuit can act as a simple indicator of ongoing electrolysis. When the circuit is complete and current flows, the bulb lights up. However, it's important to note that the presence of a lit bulb isn't the only way to confirm electrolysis. Other methods, like monitoring gas evolution or measuring solution changes, might also be used. Function: The external circuit facilitates the flow of electrons from the power source to the electrolytic cell. Electrons from the negative terminal of the power source travel through the external wire and enter the electrolytic cell at the anode. These electrons participate in the oxidation reaction that occurs at the anode surface. From the anode, the circuit needs to be complete for current to flow. This is where the external wire plays a vital role. It carries the electrons exiting the cathode back to the positive terminal of the power source, completing the electrical loop. The flow of electrons through the external circuit creates the driving force for the movement of ions within the electrolyte solution, which is essential for electrolysis to occur. Migration of ions. Migration of ions is the movement of ions towards electrodes during the passage of an electric current. The Ionic theory was put forward by Arrhenius in 1880 to explain the phenomenon of electrolysis. The theory suggests that electrolytes dissociate into electrically charged particles called ions. Ions can be either positively charged (cations) or negatively charged (anions). When current is not passed through an electrolyte, the ions are wandering randomly in solution. Figure133.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_004.jpg. However, when an electric current is applied, the cations are attracted to the negatively charged electrode, the cathode. On the other hand, the anions are attracted to the positively charged electrode, the anode. Figure134.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_005.jpg. As ions reach their respective electrodes, they undergo reactions: At the cathode, cations gain electrons and become neutral atoms. This process is called reduction. At the anode, anions lose electrons and become neutral atoms. This process is called oxidation. To maintain a complete electrical circuit, the number of electrons taken in at the cathode must be the same as the number of electrons lost at the anode. This process, where ions gain or lose electrons to become neutral atoms, is called discharge. Preferential or selective discharge: This is the choice of the ion to be discharged at each electrode when there is more than one type of positive or negative ions at the respective electrodes. Factors affecting preferential discharge. When two or more ions of similar charges are present in solution e.g., Na⁺ and Ag⁺ or OH⁻ and SO₄²⁻, one is preferentially selected for discharge. The preferential discharge depends on the following factors: 1) Position of cation in the electrochemical series. The ease of discharge of cations can be predicted based on the reactivity series. Figure135.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_006.jpg. Ions of less reactive metals have a higher tendency of getting discharged as they are less stable as ions. Due to their strong preference for forming stable ions, highly reactive metals resist being discharged back into their elemental form during electrolysis. Meaning, the ion lower in the electrochemical series is preferentially discharged. The lower the ion in the electrochemical series, the more readily it is discharged, since the energy required for discharge decreases down the electrochemical series. Example: Consider the decomposition of copper (II) sulphate solution. CuSO₄(aq) → Cu²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq). At the cathode, the ions are copper ions and hydrogen ions. Copper is preferably discharged in preference to hydrogen since copper is below hydrogen in the electrochemical series. At the anode, water is preferentially oxidized, forming oxygen gas (O₂) due to its lower energy requirement for oxidation compared to sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻). 2H₂O(aq) → O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻. Figure135.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_006.jpg. Note: Nitrate (NO₃⁻), sulphate (SO₄²⁻), and carbonate (CO₃²⁻) ions are typically not discharged at the anode in aqueous solutions due to their high oxidation state and competition from water electrolysis. Hydroxide (OH⁻) ions can play a role in some specific scenarios with high pre-existing concentrations, but not typically the main participant in most electrolysis setups. Halide Ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) can be preferentially discharged at high concentrations, forming halogen gases. 2) Concentration. Concentration is a major factor influencing which ions are discharged during electrolysis. The more ions of a type are present, the more likely they are to be discharged at the electrode. However, the electrochemical series is still useful when comparing ions with similar concentrations. Note: A concentrated solution has a lot of solute with little amount of a solvent. 3) Nature of electrodes. There are two types of electrodes. Inert electrodes (graphite or platinum) which do not take part during electrolysis and active electrodes (metallic e.g., copper) which normally take part during electrolysis by “going into solution’’. When used, they affect the reactions at electrodes. Some metal electrodes undergo oxidation more readily than anions in solution e.g., copper. Note that such reactions are used in the purification of metals. Note: Half equations are those showing the reactions taking place separately at the electrodes whereas an overall equation is one that combines the half equations at the electrodes, thus representing the overall redox reaction. Role of water in electrolysis. (i) It solvates ions in an ionic compound, weakening crystal forces and promoting their mobility. (ii) It reacts with some molecular compounds to form ions. (iii) It provides H⁺ ions and OH⁻ ions in solution. During electrolysis, water partially dissociates to form H⁺ ions and OH⁻ ions. Note that the ions that come from water must always be indicated because they also participate in the conduction of electricity. For example, in the electrolysis of dilute sodium hydroxide solution, the ions from water are very few because water is a weak electrolyte while the ions produced by sodium hydroxide are many because sodium hydroxide is a strong electrolyte. Therefore, the conductivity of electric current is majorly due to the sodium hydroxide. Electrolysis of some electrolytes. Electrolysis of molten lead (II) bromide using carbon electrodes (graphite). Figure139.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_010.jpg. When molten lead (II) bromide is in solid form, it does not conduct electricity, because there are no ions in it which would conduct electricity. When molten, the ions are free to move, which conduct electric current. Ions present. From molten lead (II) bromide (PbBr₂) are Pb²⁺ and 2Br⁻. Reactions at electrodes: Reaction at the anode: Bromide ions migrate towards the anode and are discharged by losing electrons. Observation: The reddish-brown fumes are formed at the anode. 2Br⁻(l) → Br₂(g) + 2e⁻. Reaction at the cathode: Lead (II) ions migrate to the cathode where they gain electrons and Lead is discharged. Observation: Shiny-grey beads are formed at the cathode and the weight of the cathode increases. Pb²⁺(l) + 2e⁻ → Pb(s). Qn) Explain why solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity while molten sodium chloride conducts electricity. Video69.Introducing_electrolysis.mp4. Electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid (Acidified water). In the electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid, platinum or carbon rods are used as inert electrodes. During the electrolysis, 2 volumes of hydrogen is produced at the cathode and one volume of oxygen is produced at the anode. Drawing of apparatus. Figure136.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_007.jpg. Ions present: From sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) are 2H⁺ and SO₄²⁻. From water (H₂O) are H⁺ and OH⁻. Reactions at electrodes: Reaction at the anode: Both the sulphate ions and hydroxyl ions migrate to the anode. The hydroxyl ions are discharged in preference to the sulphate ions. Note that the combination of a lower energy pathway for OH⁻ oxidation and the presence of readily available OH⁻ ions (although in a lower concentration) makes them the preferred choice for the anode reaction, despite the higher concentration of sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻) and weaker bonds within water molecules. Observation: Effervescence occurs and a colourless gas that relights a glowing splint is evolved. 4OH⁻(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g) + 4e⁻. Reaction at the cathode: Hydrogen ions migrate to the cathode where they are discharged by receiving electrons from the cathode to form atoms. The hydrogen atoms pair up to form hydrogen gas. Observation: Effervescence occurs and a colourless gas is evolved that burns with a pop sound. 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → H₂(g). Overall equation: 4OH⁻(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g) + 2H₂(g) + 2e⁻. The pH of the solution remains relatively constant, although a slight decrease might occur due to the consumption of H⁺ ions at the cathode. Electrolysis of dilute sodium hydroxide solution using carbon electrodes. Setup of the apparatus. Figure137.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_008.jpg. At the anode, the hydroxyl ions are discharged giving off bubbles of a colourless gas that relights a glowing splint. 4OH⁻(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g) + 4e⁻. At the cathode, hydrogen ions are discharged in preference to sodium ions because hydrogen is below sodium in the electrochemical series. Therefore, at the cathode, bubbles of a colourless gas that burns with a pop sound are produced. Please find out how the overall equation [8OH⁻(aq) + 2H⁺(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + H₂(g) + O₂(g)] is derived? Electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride solution (brine) using a mercury cathode and graphite/platinum anode (manufacture of sodium hydroxide solution and chlorine). Figure138.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_009.jpg. Ions present: From sodium chloride (NaCl) are Na⁺ and Cl⁻. From water (H₂O) are H⁺ and OH⁻. Reactions at electrodes: Reaction at the anode: Both the chloride and hydroxyl ions migrate to the anode but the chloride ions being more concentrated are discharged by losing electrons in preference to the hydroxyl ions. Observation: Effervescence occurs and a greenish-yellow gas that bleaches damp litmus paper is evolved. 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻. The chlorine formed can then be collected dried, liquefied and stored in tightly closed tanks. Reaction at the cathode: Both sodium and hydrogen ions move to the cathode. In this case, sodium ions are discharged despite the fact that hydrogen ions are lower than sodium ions in the electrochemical series. The high concentration of Na⁺ overcomes the lower reduction potential of H⁺, making the discharge of sodium ions more favourable. It's important to note that the presence of mercury facilitates the reduction of sodium ions. Na⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Na(l). The sodium atoms produced form a shiny, silvery amalgam layer on the surface of the mercury cathode. Na(l) + Hg(l) → NaHg(l). The amalgam is removed and treated with water to form sodium hydroxide solution. 2NaHg(l) + 2H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g) + 2Hg(l). The mercury liberated is returned to the cell for further use. The resulting solution has a pH greater than 7 due to accumulation of hydroxyl ions. Sodium hydroxide is evaporated to dryness and used for various purposes such as manufacture of soap, paper and rayon. Note: The production of sodium hydroxide using a mercury cathode is an effective method, but it has environmental drawbacks. Mercury is a toxic element, and its use can lead to contamination. For this reason, this method is being replaced by more environmentally friendly alternatives like the diaphragm cell or membrane cell methods, which use a different type of cathode and avoid the use of mercury. It's also worth noting that the Down’s process, which involves the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, is another method for chlorine production (To be covered in the next chapter, under extraction of sodium). Side effects of the process of production and mitigation. Air pollution by waste gases: Acidic gases produced can cause acid rain which leads to crumbling of buildings, lowering soil pH and corrosion of roofs made of iron. Mitigation can be done by neutralising the acidic gases before releasing waste gases into the atmosphere, and by fitting catalytic converters in exhaust pipes of machines to convert oxides of nitrogen into nitrogen and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. Social benefits: i) Employment opportunity; thus improved income; thus better standards of living. ii) Development of infrastructure e.g., electricity lines, roads, hospitals, schools, etc. Electrolysis of concentrated hydrochloric acid using graphite electrodes. Both the chloride and the hydroxyl ions migrate to the anode. The chloride ions are discharged. Therefore, a green-yellow gas that bleaches damp litmus paper is observed, indicating that the gas is chlorine gas. 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻. However, depending on the specific concentration and other factors, a secondary reaction involving water oxidation might also occur: 2H₂O(l) → O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻. At very high concentrations, the competition between chloride ion discharge and water oxidation might shift slightly, with a higher chance of some water oxidation occurring. Prolonged electrolysis can also influence the extent of water oxidation. Hydrogen ions migrate to the cathode where they are discharged forming bubbles of a colourless gas that burns with a pop sound (hydrogen gas). 2H⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → H₂(g). Electrolysis of concentrated copper (II) chloride solution (Using copper cathode and graphite anode). Ions present: From copper (II) chloride (CuCl₂) are Cu²⁺ and Cl⁻. From water (H₂O) are H⁺ and OH⁻. Reaction at the electrodes: Reaction at the anode: Observation: Effervescence occurs and a greenish-yellow gas is evolved. 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cl₂(g) + 2e⁻. Reaction at the cathode: Observation: A brown solid is deposited. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). Overall equation: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Cl⁻(aq) → Cu(s) + Cl₂(g). Electrolysis of copper (II) sulphate solution using graphite electrodes. Figure140.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_011.jpg. Ions present: From copper (II) sulphate (CuSO₄) are Cu²⁺ and SO₄²⁻. From water (H₂O) are H⁺ and OH⁻. Reaction at the electrodes: Reaction at the cathode: Cu²⁺ is preferentially discharged since it is lower than H⁺ in the electrochemical series. Observation: A brown solid of copper is deposited at the cathode and the weight of the cathode increases. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). The blue colour of the copper (II) sulphate fades away with time as the copper ions which are responsible for the blue colour are being discharged and deposited at the cathode as brown copper metal. Reaction at the anode: Observation: Effervescence occurs and a colourless gas that relights a glowing splint is evolved. While OH⁻ ions may be present, the oxidation of water molecules (2H₂O(l) → O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻) is more likely at the anode. Note that the presence of Cu²⁺ ions creates a more favourable competition for the cathode reaction; Water oxidation, though less energetically favourable, becomes the preferred anode reaction. While some OH⁻ ions might be generated indirectly, their low concentration and the ease of Cu²⁺ reduction make water oxidation the dominant anode reaction. However, note that the volumes of gas collected are very small, making it difficult to carry out their tests. In some cases, these H⁺ from water oxidation may react with SO₄²⁻ to form sulphuric acid, causing a slight increase in acidity near the anode. 2H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → H₂SO₄(aq). Though H₂SO₄ formation is usually minimal in dilute copper (II) sulphate solutions, this localised increase in acidity can be observed in more concentrated solutions or with prolonged electrolysis. Overall equation: Dividig equation (i) by 2 and adding it to equation (ii) gives: Cu²⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) → Cu(s) + ½O₂(g) + 2H⁺(aq). Electrolysis of copper (II) sulphate solution using copper anode and graphite cathode. Figure141.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_012.jpg. Ions present: From copper (II) sulphate (CuSO₄) are Cu²⁺ and SO₄²⁻. From water (H₂O) are H⁺ and OH⁻. Reaction at the electrodes: Both sulphate and hydroxide ions migrate to the anode but none is discharged. Instead, the copper anode goes into solution i.e., it dissolves to form Cu²⁺. Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻. This process is called electrode ionization. Such a process is favoured in this case as it requires less energy than the discharge of ions. The Cu²⁺ produced migrate to the cathode where they are deposited as as a brown solid (copper metal), maintaining the overall concentration of copper ions in the solution. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). Impurities either dissolve in the electrolyte or are deposited as sludge around the anode. Note that the anode decreases in mass/size whereas the cathode increases in mass/size. Electrolysis of copper (II) sulphate solution using copper electrodes. Figure142.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_013.jpg. This reaction is used in the purification of copper. Impure copper is used as the anode while pure copper acts as the cathode. The electrodes are immersed in an acidified copper (II) sulphate solution. Observations: At the anode, OH⁻ ions are not discharged since the electrode is not inert but they might play a minor role in the reaction, depending on the electrolyte concentration. Instead, the dominant reaction is the oxidation of copper atoms from the impure anode: Cu(s) → Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻. The impure copper anode gradually dissolves as the atoms are oxidised. The weight of the anode decreases because the copper atoms dissolve from it and enter the solution as copper (II) ions. Impurities present in the copper anode are left behind and may dissolve in the electrolyte or sink as sludge. At the cathode, Cu²⁺ ions in the electrolyte are discharged and deposited as brown solid copper. The pure copper cathode gains mass as a layer of pure copper is deposited: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). The colour of the solution relatively remains blue throughout the electrolysis process, because the copper (II) ions consumed at the cathode for copper deposition are replenished by the copper atoms dissolving from the impure anode. However, there might be some slight variations in colour intensity depending on factors like the initial concentration and the duration of electrolysis. Note that: i) During these last two experiments (Electrolysis of copper (II) sulphate solution using copper electrodes & Electrolysis of copper (II) sulphate solution using copper anode and graphite cathode), the anode loses mass and the cathode gains mass. The loss in mass at the anode equals to the gain in mass at the cathode. The change in mass at either electrode is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte. ii) The intensity of the blue colour of copper (II) sulphate remains relatively constant as the process is a mere transfer of the copper (II) ions from the anode to cathode. i.e., the copper from the anode goes into solution as ions to replace the lost copper ions at the cathode. iii) The overall concentration of the electrolyte remains constant. Uses of copper. Copper's impressive properties make it a highly versatile metal. Due to its excellent electrical conductivity, it's the go-to material for electrical wiring in homes, industries, and power grids. Its good heat conductivity makes it perfect for kettles, boilers, and cookware, while its beautiful luster adds value to decorative items and ornaments. Copper is also a key component in alloys like brass and bronze, which inherit desirable traits like strength and workability for various applications. The resistance of copper to corrosion makes it suitable for minting coins and constructing water pipes that can withstand high pressure. Copper's heat transfer properties are also beneficial in heat exchangers for boilers. Applications of electrolysis. Electrolysis is widely used in a number of processes that include: Extraction of metals e.g., aluminium, sodium etc.; Purification of metals e.g., copper (already covered); Manufacture of sodium hydroxide and chlorine (already covered); Electroplating; And, anodisation and dyeing of aluminium. 1) Purification of metals such copper and zinc. Metals such as copper and zinc may be purified by electrolysis. The electrolyte is usually an acidified solution of a salt containing the metal to be purified. In copper refining, the impure copper is made the anode while a pure strip of copper is made the Cathode (check the notes above for the procedure). 2) Electroplating. This the process of coating one metal with another metal by means of electrolysis. In electroplating, the metal to be plated is made the cathode and the plating metal is made the anode. The electrolyte is normally a soluble salt of the metal used for coating. For an effective electroplating: A clean cathode must be used; a steady current must flow; a steady temperature must be maintained and the concentration of the electrolytes must also be steady. Electroplating is used to improve the beauty of an article (silver), prevent material from corrosion (silver and chromium), give a material a hard surface (chromium), give thickness to worn parts of machinery (nickel). The plating of an object with copper metal is shown below. Figure144.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_015.jpg. Copper metal acts as the anode as it is used to plate the object. The electrolyte used is a salt solution of its salt (copper (II) sulphate solution) and the object to be plated acts as the cathode. At the anode, the copper atoms are oxidised into Cu²⁺ ions, which enter the electrolyte. At the cathode, Cu²⁺ ions are discharged and deposited on the object, plating it with copper metal. Below is a setup used to electroplate iron nail with zinc. Figure145.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_016.jpg. 3) Extraction of metals. More reactive metals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium are extracted by electrolysis of their molten compounds (To be covered in detail in the next chapter). In groups, collect and interpret data on the existence of various ores in Uganda and produce a chart to explain the contribution of metal extraction to the Ugandan economy, explain the relevance of reduction/oxidation to metal extraction. 4) Anodisation and dyeing of aluminium. Aluminium objects may be coated with a thin layer of aluminium oxide using electricity, a process known as anodisation. During the process, the aluminium object is made the anode and the electrolyte is dilute sulphuric acid. The aluminium oxide coating is important in preventing corrosion. The thickness and properties of the oxide layer can be controlled by factors like voltage, electrolyte concentration, and processing time. The porous nature of the anodised oxide layer allows for dyeing the aluminium. Dyes are absorbed into the pores, creating a coloured anodised aluminium surface. Overall, this is a versatile technique that enhances the functionality and aesthetics of aluminium for various applications. In groups, discuss electrolysis and produce illustrations to explain: The meaning of an electrolyte; moving ions and electrical conductivity. In groups, use carbon electrodes in the electrolysis of copper (II) sulphate solution and dilute sulphuric acid and: Identify cations and anions in the aqueous solutions, describe the electrolysis of the aqueous solutions and write half equations for the discharge of ions at the anode and the cathode. [Assignment 4] {Explain the applications of the processes of oxidation and reduction in electrochemical cells}. Electrochemical cells. Electrochemical cells fall into two main categories based on their reaction type and rechargeability: 1) Primary/galvanic cells that rely on spontaneous chemical reactions to generate electricity. These are disposable, like dry cells in your remote, and cannot be recharged after the reactants are used up. 2) Secondary/electrolytic cells that require an external electrical source to drive non-spontaneous chemical reactions. These are rechargeable, like lithium-ion batteries in laptops, and can be used repeatedly by reversing the reactions with an external charge. Note that electrochemical cells utilize redox reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. 1) Primary cells, non-rechargeable cells. These cells basically consist of two half-cells of different elements. Each element is dipped in a solution of its own ions and is called an electrode. The cell uses two different metals as electrodes and the voltage produced varies depending on the metals used. In such a cell, the more reactive metal acts as the anode while the less reactive metal acts as the cathode. The tendency of a metal to dissolve when in solution of its own ions can be measured by joining two half cells to from a galvanic or voltaic cell. A good example of a voltaic cell is the Daniell cell. Overall, primary cells offer a simple way to convert chemical energy to electricity but cannot be recharged once the reactants are consumed. Daniell cell. The Daniell cell consists of a zinc rod dipped in zinc sulphate solution (zinc half-cell) and a copper rod dipped in copper (II) sulphate solution (copper half-cell), the two solutions being separated by a porous partition or salt bridge. Note that the Daniell cell traditionally uses a salt bridge because the two half-cells (zinc sulphate and copper sulphate) have different electrolytes. A salt bridge is an inverted U-tube made of glass and contains potassium chloride or potassium nitrate solution or pieces of filter paper wetted with these salts. It has the following functions: It keeps the ionic charges balanced from both sides of the cell. It provides electrical contact between the two electrodes by allowing ions migrate from one electrolyte to another. Overall, both salt bridges and porous partitions serve the same purpose of not allowing the bulk solutions to mix, but the choice depends on the specific design and electrolyte composition of the electrochemical cell. In the Daniell cell, current flows from the positive electrode to the negative electrode and electrons flow from the negative electrode to the positive electrode. The metal rods are connected by use of a metal wire, forming the external circuit along which the liberated electrons flow from zinc to copper. These electrons are accepted by the copper (II) ions of copper (II) sulphate solution to form copper metal. Figure146.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_017.jpg. Figure147.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_018.jpg. Reaction at the zinc half-cell (anode). Zinc rod dissolves forming zinc ions in solution. In the process, electrons are released and they flow out of the anode through the wire. Zn(s) → Zn²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ (oxidation). Excess electrons are deposited on the zinc electrode making it the negative terminal. However, the zinc rod is the anode since this is where oxidation takes place. The zinc half-cell can be represented as: Zn(s) / Zn²⁺(aq). Reaction at the copper half-cell (cathode). Copper (II) ions are discharged at the copper electrode. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s) (reduction). The copper electrode is the cathode since reduction takes place at this electrode. The copper half-cell can be represented as: Cu²⁺(aq) / Cu(s). Overall cell reaction. The overall cell reaction is derived by adding the two half equations. The electrons on either side of the two equations cancel out. Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s). The cell convention for the overall reaction is: Zn(s) / Zn²⁺(aq) // Cu²⁺(aq) / Cu(s). Cell notation (cell diagram). The cell representation shows the sequence in which the reactions proceed. Zn(s) | Zn²⁺(aq) || Cu²⁺(aq) | Cu(s). The two vertical lines (||) represent a salt bridge that links the two cell electrolytes. The vertical line between Zn(s) and Zn²⁺(aq) represents a phase boundary between the zinc electrode and its aqueous ions. The vertical line between Cu(s) and Cu²⁺(aq) represents the phase boundary between the copper electrode and the copper ions in the electrolyte. In the cell representation, the cathode is always on the left–hand side and anode on the right–hand side. A greater voltage is produced when the two metals used are far apart in the reactivity series; A magnesium-copper cell generates a higher voltage than a zinc-copper cell, since the difference in reactivity is greater in the magnesium-copper cell. The force with which the electrons flow between the two half cells creates a potential difference between them. This force is called the electromotive force (E.m.f). E.m.f(cell) = E(right)- E(left). E(right) = electrode potential at right hand side. E(left) = electrode potential at left hand side. The Daniell cell works at a constant voltage measured by a voltmeter; The voltage produced by the Daniell cell is approximately 1.1 volts. However, the cell cannot produce energy continuously because the chemicals get used up and hence the e.m.f of the cell becomes zero. Note that the Daniell cell offers a stable and long-lasting source of electricity compared to some other primary cells due to minimal mixing of solutions. A dry cell is another common example of a primary cell. In a dry cell, the electrolyte is in the form of a paste, typically consisting of ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) and other components like zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) and moisture-absorbing materials. This paste form makes the cell "dry" compared to wet cells with liquid electrolytes. The zinc electrode, usually in the form of a cylindrical pot is the anode, the negative terminal. The carbon electrode, usually in the form of a central rod is the cathode, the positive terminal. MnO₂, packed around the carbon rod, acts as an oxidizing agent in the electrolyte. Qn) The cell diagram for an electrochemical cell is shown below: Ag(s) | Ag⁺(aq) || Cu²⁺(aq) | Cu(s). (i) Name two substances that could be used as electrodes. Silver nitrate solution and copper (II) sulphate solution. (ii) State which electrode is the anode. Copper electrode. (iii) Write equation for the reaction at: i) Anode: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). ii) Cathode: Ag(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + e⁻. (iv) Write the overall equation. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2Ag(s) → Cu(s) + 2Ag⁺(aq). 2) Secondary cells, rechargeables cells. The lead-acid battery used in vehicles to power the starter motor, is a classic example of a secondary cell. It consists of six 2V cells connected in series. Each cell consists of two lead plates dipping into a 30% solution of sulphuric acid. One of the plates is coated with lead (IV) oxide, PbO₂. The lead plate and the lead (IV) oxide - coated plate have different electrode potentials, so when they are connected, current flows between them. The electrode processes are: Positive plate: 2PbO₂(s) + 2H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + 2e⁻ → PbSO₄(s) + 2H₂O(l). Negative electrode: Pb(s) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → PbSO₄(s) + 2e⁻. When PbO₂ and Pb have been converted into PbSO₄, there is no difference between the plates, and the cell can no longer give a current. The battery must be charged. The battery is charged by passing a direct electric current through it. This reverses the electrode processes in the cells to produce lead and lead (IV) oxide. The battery can again give a current. When the vehicle is in motion, it drives a generator which charges the battery. If there is too much stopping and starting, the battery loses its charge and becomes flat until it is recharged. During discharge, sulphuric acid is formed. During charge, it is used up. Since sulphuric acid is much denser than water, the state of the battery can be assessed by measuring the density of the battery acid with a hydrometer. Part of a lead-acid battery. Figure148.4.1.oxidation_and_reduction_reactions_image_019.jpg. Practical uses of electrochemical cells. From the tiny button cell powering your watch, to the large and powerful battery bank in a Tesla, electrochemical cells silently weave themselves into the fabric of our daily lives. These versatile devices come in both disposable (like dry cells in your remote) and rechargeable forms (like the lead-acid battery starting your car), keeping our world buzzing. They're the silent partners in our portable electronics (laptops, phones, and cameras, thanks to long-lasting lithium-ion batteries), and they even play a crucial role in the future of clean energy by enabling large-scale grid storage of renewable sources like solar and wind. But their impact goes beyond just simple power. Electrochemical cells stand guard against the ever-present threat of rust. A special type, called a sacrificial anode, protects metal structures by essentially acting as a decoy, corroding preferentially to save the desired infrastructure. Fuel cells, another emerging technology, utilize these same principles to convert chemical energy from fuels like hydrogen directly into electricity, offering a clean and efficient alternative for powering vehicles and generating electricity. In short, electrochemical cells are the workhorses of our modern world, and as technology advances, we can expect even more innovative applications of these remarkable devices. Video70.How_batteries_work.mp4. Laws of electrolysis. The laws of electrolysis express the quantitative results of electrolysis and were first stated by Faraday. According to his laws, the amount of the substance produced during electrolysis depends on: (i) The time for which a steady current is passed through the electrolyte solution. (ii) Magnitude of the steady current. (iii) Charge on the ion of the element. Faraday’s first law. It states that the mass of a substance produced at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through it. Quantity of electricity = Current x time. Q = It. A Faraday is the quantity of electricity required to deposit one mole of a substance from an ion with a single charge / It is the quantity of electricity carried by one mole of electrons. For monovalent elements like sodium, silver and potassium. 1 mole of electrons is needed to liberate 1 mole of the element. One mole of sodium ions requires one Faraday (1 mole of electrons) to discharge at the cathode. Na⁺(aq) + e⁻ → Na(s). For divalent elements such as copper, iron (II), calcium and zinc. 2 moles of electrons are needed to deposit 1 mole of the substance. One mole of lead (II) ions requires 2 Faradays (2 moles of electrons) to discharge at the cathode. Pb²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Pb(s). For trivalent elements such as iron (III) and aluminium. 3 moles of electrons are needed to deposit 1 mole of the element. One mole of aluminium ions requires 3 Faradays (3 moles of electrons) to discharge at cathode. Al³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻ → Al(s). One mole of electrons is equivalent to one Faraday. One Faraday = 96500 Coulombs. A Coulomb (C) is the quantity of electricity passed when a current of one ampere flows in one second. 1e⁻ = 1F = 96500C. Faraday’s second law. It states that the mass of a substance deposited at the electrodes is inversely proportional to the charge on its ion. i.e., when the same quantity of electricity is passed through solutions of different electrolytes, the relative number of moles of the elements deposited are inversely proportional to the charges on the ions of each of the elements respectively. General applications of Faraday’s laws of electrolysis. Faraday’s laws of electrolysis can be used to determine: i) Quantity of electricity passed through an electrolyte for a specific time. ii) The mass (moles) or volume of substances liberated / deposited during electrolysis. iii) The relative atomic mass of substances. iv) The charge on the ions discharged. Example 1: Calculating quantity of electricity used. Qn) A current of 3A was passed through a solution of zinc sulphate for 10 minutes. Calculate the quantity of electricity used. Q=It. Q=3x10x60 = 1800C. Qn) A current of 12A is passed through a solution of aluminium chloride for 3 minutes. Calculate the quantity of electricity required to deposit one mole of aluminium. Al³⁺(aq) + 3e⁻ → Al(s). 3 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of aluminium. But 1 Faraday = 1 mole of electrons. Therefore, according to the equation. 1 mole of Al is deposited by 3F i.e., (3x96500) C = 289500C. Qn) A current of 0.5A flows for 1 hour, 40 minutes and 20 seconds through copper (II) sulphate solution. Determine: i) The quantity of electricity passed. ii) The mass of copper deposited. iii) The volume of oxygen liberated. (1 mole of gas occupies 24000cm³ at RTP, Cu=64, O=16, 1F=96500C). i) Q = It. I=0.5A, t = (1x60x60+4x60+20)s = 6020s. Q = (0.5 X 6920)C = 3010C. ii) 2 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, 2 Faradays deposit 1 mole of copper. (2x96500)C deposits 64g of copper. 3010C deposits (3010x64/193000) = 0.998g of copper. iii) 4 moles of electrons liberate 1 mole of oxygen. Therefore, 4 Faradays liberate 1mole of oxygen. (4x96500)C liberates 24000cm³ of oxygen. 3010C liberates (3010x24000/386000) = 187.2cm³ of oxygen. Qn) A current of 2A was passed through copper (II) sulphate solution for 20 minutes. Find the quantity of electricity used (Answer is 3600C). Qn) A current of 4A was passed through lead (II) bromide solution for one and half hours. Find the quantity electricity passed through the solution (21600C). Example 2: Calculating the charge on the metal. For the charge on the ion of an element to be determined, the amount (moles) of the element discharged and number of moles of electrons must be known. Amount of element discharged / moles = Number of moles of electrons / Charge number on one ion of the element. 1) During electrolysis, it was calculated that 0.2 Faradays were needed to deposit 0.1 moles of an element X at the cathode. What is the charge on the ion of X. Given that: Faraday is equivalent to moles of electrons = 0.2. Moles of X deposited = 0.1. 0.1 = 0.2/Charge on X. Charge on X = 0.2/0.1 = 2. 2) When a metal of relative atomic mass 207 is deposited by electrolysis, a current of 0.0600A flowing for 66 minutes increases the mass of the cathode by 0.254g. a) Find; i) The number of moles deposited. ii) The number of moles of electrons that have passed. b) Deduce the number of units of charge on the cation of the metal. Given that: RAM = 207, I = 0.060A, t = (66x60) s = 3960s, mass of metal deposited = 0.254g. i) Moles = Mass deposited / relative atomic mass = 0.253/207 = 0.00123 moles. ii) Quantity of electricity = It = (0.0060x3960) C = 237.6C. 96500C liberates 1 mole of electrons. 1C liberates (1/96500) moles of electrons. 237.6C liberates (237.6x1/96500) = 0.00246 moles. Therefore, moles of electrons that have passed is 0.00246 moles. iii) 0.00123 = 0.00246/Charge. Charge = 0.00246/0.00123 = 2. Qn) When a current was passed through a solution of silver nitrate and a solution of metal Y, 4.32g of silver and 2.24g of Y were formed respectively. Calculate the charge on Y (Ag = 108, Y = 112). 108g of silver contains 1 mole. 4.32g of silver contains (1x4.32)/108 = 0.04moles. 112g of Y contains 1 mole. 2.24g of Y contain (1x2.24)/112 = 0.02moles. Mole ratio: Ag 		Y. 0.04 		0.02) 0.04/0.02	0.02/0.02. 2		1. The charge on Y is 2+. This is because the number of moles deposited is inversely proportional to the number of charges on ion. Example 3: Calculating the relative atomic mass. The RAM of a substance discharged during electrolysis can be estimated if a steady current passed through its solution, time taken and mass deposited are all known. When a current of 0.45A was passed through a solution of copper (II) sulphate for 25 minutes, 0.222g of copper were deposited. Calculate the relative atomic mass of copper. Q = It = 0.45x25x60 = 675C. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). 2 moles of electrons are required to produce 1 mole of Cu. 2x96500 = 193000C. 675C deposit 0.222g of copper. 193000C deposit (193000x0.222)/675 = 63.5g of copper. Qn) A current of 0.25A flowing for 13 minutes through a nickel (II) Chloride solution deposits 0.059g of nickel. Determine the RAM of nickel. Q = It. Given that I = 0.25A. t = (13x60) s = 780s. Q = (0.25x780) = 195C. 195C deposits 0.059g of nickel. But from the equation. Ni²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Ni(s). 2 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of nickel. (2 x 96500)C deposits (0.059x193000/195) = 58.4g of nickel. Therefore, the RAM of nickel is 58.4. Example 4: Calculating mass of substance deposited at cathode. A concentrated solution of copper (II) chloride was electrolysed using copper cathode and graphite anode.

(iv) Calculate the mass of the product at the cathode when 3240C of electricity is passed through the electrolyte (Cu=64, 1 Faraday=96500C). Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). 2moles of electrons are required to produce 1 mole of copper. 2x96500=193000C. 193000C produce 64g of Cu. 3240C produce (3240x64)/193000 = 1.07g of Cu. Qn) What is the amount of copper deposited when 96500C of electricity is passed through a solution of copper (II) sulphate. Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). 2 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of copper. Therefore, 2F deposits 1 mole of copper. (2x96500)C deposits 1 mole of copper. 96500C deposits (96500x1x1/193000) moles of copper = 0.5moles of copper. Example 5: Calculating volume of gas liberated at electrodes. 1) A current of 6.0A was passed for 3 minutes during electrolysis of acidified water. Calculate the volume of oxygen gas evolved at STP during the process of electrolysis. (1 mole of gas occupies 22.4dm³ at STP, 1 Faraday = 96500C). Q = It. Q = 6x3x60 = 1080C. 4OH⁻(aq) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g) + 4e⁻. 4 moles of electrons are lost to produce 1 mole of oxygen. 4x96500=386000C. 386000C liberate 22.4dm³ of O₂. 1080C liberate (1080 x 22.4)/386000 = 0.063dm³ of oxygen. 2) A current of 0.5A flows through nickel (II) sulphate solution for 6 minutes and 30 seconds. Determine: i) The mass of nickel deposited. ii) The volume of gas produced at the anode. (Ni=59, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4dm³ at STP, 1F =96500C). i) Q = It. Given that I = 0.5A. t = (60x60+30)s = 390s. Q = 0.5x390 = 195C. Ni²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Ni(s). 2 moles of electrons deposit 1 mole of nickel. Therefore, 2 Faraday deposits 1mole of nickel. (2x96500)C deposits 59g of nickel. 195C deposits (195x1x59/193000) = 0.06g of nickel. ii) 4OH⁻ (aq) – 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g). From the equation, 4 moles of electrons liberate 1 mole of oxygen. Therefore, 4 Faradays liberate 1 mole of oxygen. (4x96500)C liberates 22.4dm³ of oxygen. 195C liberates (195x1x195/386000) = 0.0113dm³ of oxygen was evolved.
