Item 5 [UNEB Sample]: Natural resources have been destroyed as a result of increasing population and human activities. This has attracted the attention of the officials from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). The officials are planning to create awareness to the people of the country through sensitization workshops organized in different district communities. Task: As a chemistry student, prepare a short presentation you will deliver during the workshop upon invitation.#Resources are classified as: Renewable and Non-renewable. Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replenished e.g., Air, water vapour, dust etc.#Non-renewable resources cannot be replenished (get used up) e.g., fossil fuels, rocks/minerals (03 scores).#Composition of natural resources.#Air contains Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon dioxide, rare gases.#Water contains Hydrogen and oxygen.#Fossil fuels contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen.#Rocks contain Iron, copper, calcium carbonate, and other minerals like Gold, Cobalt, etc (02 scores).#Impact of natural resources on the environment and how it occurs / chemicals and physical reactions and mitigation.#Air#- Some components of Air pollute the environment and cause global warming, carbondioxide being a greenhouse gas, traps heat in the atmosphere.#C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g).#- Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas and causes suffocation, carbon monoxide can also be converted to carbon dioxide.#2CO(g) + O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g).#Mitigation:#Increased Afforestation to replace the cut trees which absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere to reduce global warming.#Carbon monoxide effects and production can be reduced by using catalytic converters on exhaust pipes of cars and other fuel engines to reduce the poison in the environment.#Water Impact and how it occurs.#Water contains dissolved gases like O₂ and CO₂. The CO₂ in it forms carbonic acid.#H₂O(l) + CO₂(g) → H₂CO₃(aq).#The carbonic acid makes water acidic. The acid rains dissolve or deplete rocks.#H₂CO₃(aq) + CaCO₃(s) → Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq).#Water has dissolved oxygen which facilitates rusting of iron containing materials according to the following equation:#4Fe(s) + 3O₂(g) + 2xH₂O(l) → 2Fe₂O₃.xH₂O(s).#Hot water as an effluent from industries when introduced into the water bodies, increases the temperature of the water bodies affecting the life of aquatic organisms.#Water pollution caused by farming and Agriculture. So, the use of fertilizers results in Eutrophication of nearby water bodies and Algae blooms/algal bloom.#Re-afforestation to reduce the impact of acid rains.#Use of Alloys, painting, galvanising to reduce the effect of rusting.#Hot water reservoirs and effluent deposit points from factories to cool the exhaust water before introduction into the water bodies.#Use of organic fertilizers e.g., manure from both animal and plant waste which are Biodegradable and reduce on use of synthetic fertilisers.#Vehicles and machines burn fossil fuels, introducing gaseous pollutants into the atmosphere.#2C(s) + O₂(g) → 2CO(g).#CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l).#S(s) + O₂(g) → SO₂(g).#2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2SO₃(g).#Mitigation:#Use of alternative fuel and energy sources like solar and Hydroelectric Power (HEP) from the sun and water respectively reduce on depletion of Fossils and also the decrease in gaseous pollutants (03 scores).#Benefits:#Air facilitates respiration, during respiration, carbohydrates combine with oxygen in order to release energy and carbon dioxide used for proper body functioning. Air facilitates photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from air combines with water in presence of sunlight trapped by chlorophyll to form glucose, carbohydrates and oxygen.#Fossil fuels are used as fuels; fossil fuels when burnt produce heat energy used to run engines and machines and for cooking.#Water is a habitat for many aquatic organisms; water bodies like lakes, rivers, swamps, dams and pools contain necessary conditions for survival of animals like fish, snails, snakes, worms, bacteria and plants e.g., blue green algae planktons which are fish foods etc.#Water bodies like; lakes, rivers, pools, as well as water vapour from plants play a crucial role in rain formation.#Water from the water bodies evaporates and eventually cools and condenses on the clouds, this results into precipitation.#Water bodies like rivers can be used to generate electricity, fast moving waters to the rivers drive turbines at waterfalls which produce kinetic energy that is converted into electrical energy (02 scores).

Item 6 [UNEB Sample]: Osukuru village in Tororo district is at the foot of Tororo rock. People of this village for a long time have practiced charcoal burning, animal husbandry, crop husbandry and stone quarrying, recently the animals have started dying and wells are drying up yet the little water available is not fresh. The locals are now wondering why all these are happening. A sensitization workshop is to be organized to explain the existing situation in the village. The theme of the work shop is MY ENVIRONMENT MY RESPONSIBILITY. Task: As a chemistry student, write a message you will deliver upon invitation.#Theme ‘MY ENVIRONMENT MY RESPONSIBILITY’#Resources in our environment which we use to satisfy our needs; water, air, trees, grass, rocks.#They are classified as renewable and non-renewable.#Renewable resources can be sustained e.g., air, water, grass.#Non-renewable resources can be exhausted and not replaceable e.g., fossil fuels, rocks etc. (03 scores).#Composition of natural resources.#Air: is composed of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon dioxide, rare gases, water vapour and dust in different proportions.#Water: is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen. It has dissolved minerals, micro-organisms and living things.#Rocks: are of different types for example igneous, sedimentary metamorphic.#They contain minerals for example limestone, iron, gold, copper, quartz, etc.#Trees and natural vegetation are made up of important elements like carbon, hydrogen, magnesium etc. (depending on the soil composition) (02 scores).#Impact of natural resources on the environment and how it occurs / chemicals and physical reactions and mitigation.#Impact to the Environment:#Several activities impact negatively on natural resources for example:#Charcoal burning that involves cutting down of trees which leads to deforestation and loss of habitat for wild animals. It leads to increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which contributes to climate change and global warming.#Mitigation:#Ensure sustainable fuel production using soft wood which is renewable. (Afforestation).#Use charcoal briquettes made from waste organic materials.#Stone quarrying:#Involves breaking of rocks into small stones and gravel for construction purposes. This disrupts the underground water cycle and sources hence reduced water quality, air pollution from dust, destruction of vegetation cover.#Mitigation:#Strict government policies and laws against stone quarrying. Filling up holes made during the process of quarrying, encourage population to use alternative construction materials like tiles and clay bricks.#Farming:#Involves the use of fertilisers and manure which pollutes water bodies and makes the water unsafe for use.#Mitigation:#Sensitise farmers to use controlled doses of fertilisers and manure in gardens.#Animal Husbandry:#Causes water pollution through their excreta.#Mitigation:#People should ensure proper disposal of animal excreta and also convert it into other useful products for example biogas, organic fertilisers and briquettes (03 scores).#Benefit / importance of natural resources.#Air is used for respiration; During respiration, carbohydrates combine with oxygen in air to release energy and carbon dioxide used for proper body functioning.#Air facilitates photosynthesis; during photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from air combines with water in presence of sunlight trapped by chlorophyll to form glucose and oxygen.#Fossil fuels are used as fuels: Fossil fuels when burnt, produce heat energy used to run engines and machines, even for cooking (02 scores).#[Tr. Kajubi Charles]#MY ENVIRONMENT MY RESPONSIBILITY.#Greetings to every member of the village, our village, Osukuru has a various natural resource which can be categorized as renewable resources and non-renewable resources.#Renewable resources are resources that we use and are easily replenished easily, they do not get used up. Examples of renewable resources include, water, air, forests among others. Non renewable resources are resources that are not replenished easily once they are used up; they take millions of years to be formed. Examples of non-renewable resources include fossil fuels and rocks.#All renewable and non-renewable resources have different compositions for example; air is a mixture of gasses found in the atmosphere, it’s made up of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide dust, rare gases like argon and pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide among others. Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. Forests consist different plant species and, in their structure, they are also made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen like their cellulose cell walls.#The fossil fuels are formed from decomposition of animal and plant remains like coal and petroleum, they are also made up of hydrogen, and carbon.#The rocks are aggregates of minerals like iron, calcium, magnesium among others.#Recently, your animals have started dying, wells are drying and the available water is not safe for use.#All that must have resulted from the activities you do carry out irresponsibly in this village which include, charcoal burning, animal husbandry, crop husbandry and stone quarrying.#These activities impact negatively on natural resources for example charcoal burning involves cutting down of trees which is deforestation leading to shortage of grazing grounds for all animals and loss of habitat for wild animals. It also leads to increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which contributes to climate change and global warming hence the wells dry up due to increased temperatures.#Stone quarrying involves breaking of rocks into small stones and gravel for construction purposes. This disrupts the underground water cycle and sources hence reduced water quality make the water in the village unsafe for use, air pollution from dust, destruction of vegetation cover reducing the grazing grounds for the animals causing their death.#Farming, crop and animal husbandry, involves the use of fertilizers and manure which pollutes water bodies and makes the water unsafe for use. Fertilizers also cause eutrophication in water bodies leading to growth of algae on water bodies, this contaminates the water and also kills aquatic animals.#All the above impacts caused by our activities have mitigations to help us conserve our resources because they are so important to us. The mitigations to avoid the above impacts include the following;#Ensure sustainable fuel production using soft wood which is renewable through planting more trees. The trees also help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere thus preventing global warming that leads to climatic changes.#The planted trees also help in rain formation thereby filling the dried-up water sources.#The planted trees also restore the grazing grounds and habitats for animals, this reduces on their death.#Use charcoal briquettes made from waste organic materials like banana peelings and cassava flour instead of using charcoal that requires cutting down of trees that are important in keeping a fresh environment.#Strict government policies and laws to minimize stone quarrying. This reduces on destruction of rock beds that are important in water purification hence having clean and safe water in wells.#Filling up holes made during the process of quarrying, encourage population to use alternative construction materials like tiles and clay bricks. This enables growth of vegetation cover favouring rain formation and restoring grazing grounds for animals.#Sensitise farmers to use controlled doses of fertilisers and manure in gardens, this helps to reduce the effects of water pollution in the village.#People should ensure proper disposal of animal excreta and also convert it into other useful products for example biogas, organic fertilisers and briquettes. This also reduces effects of water pollution, hence clean water sources.#Farmers should be encouraged to use organic fertilizers in the gardens such as compost manure#The natural resources in the village are very useful, that’s why we should conserve them Air is used for respiration, during respiration carbohydrate combine with oxygen in air to release energy and carbon dioxide used for proper body functioning.#Air facilitates photosynthesis, during photosynthesis carbon dioxide from air combines with water in presence of sunlight trapped by chlorophyll to form glucose and oxygen.#Fossil fuels are used as fuels, fossil fuels when burnt produce heat energy used to run engines and machines, even for cooking.

Item 5: For the past 20 years, district A started developing at a fast pace, with many trading centres being established in different villages. The development has seen many swamps being reclaimed and forests cleared to make space for new buildings. Stone quarrying has become popular to meet the demand for the on-going construction in the area. The senior citizens are wondering why the wells and springs are slowly drying up and the water not being fresh as it used to be. They have also noticed changes in seasons and poor harvests which have led to famine. The issues were communicated to the District Environment Officer who in turn raised them in one of the district council meetings. Task: Using your knowledge of chemistry, prepare a presentation you would share when asked by the council members (09 scores).
