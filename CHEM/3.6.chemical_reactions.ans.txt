Chemical reactions involve one or more substances, called reactants, undergoing a transformation. These reactants can be fundamental building blocks like elements or more complex combinations known as compounds. During a chemical reaction, the bonds between the atoms in the reactants break and rearrange, forming entirely new substances called products that often possess similar properties. Is this all true?;
During a chemical reaction, there are three main events that usually occur. The reactants get used up and products form in their place. Heat energy is either evolved or taken in. And for a fixed amount of reactant or reactants, a fixed amount of product or products is eventually formed. Is this all true?;
When we talk of rate, time is a factor that is being considered. Rate refers to the change of an activity in a given time. Rates of reactions indicate how fast reactions are occurring. Some reactions occur very rapidly e.g., explosions and precipitation while others occur very slowly e.g., rusting and fermentation. Some reactions proceed at a moderate rate e.g., reaction between hydrochloric acid and zinc metal. Could there be a wrong statement?;
Kinetics is a branch of Chemistry that deals with the study of rates of chemical reactions. Rate of chemical reaction is the amount of the products formed per unit time or is the amount of reactants consumed or used up per unit time. Rate = Amount of products formed or Amount of reactants used up / Time taken. Units for rate of reaction are moles/litre/second i.e., mol/L/s. Is this all true?;
During a chemical reaction, the concentration of reactants decreases while that of the products increases. The concentration of the reactants decreases because they are being used up to form products and the concentration of products increases until a maximum point when it remains constant, implying that all reactants have been used up. Could there be a wrong statement?;
The study of rates of reaction enables us to: Design new chemical substances such as drugs that work better. Design new ways of making chemicals efficiently through optimizing chemical processes. Predict reaction outcomes. Is this all true?;
The collision theory of a chemical reaction states that a reaction occurs when the particles involved in the reaction collide together in the right way and if they have the appropriate energy or right energy. This energy is called activation energy and it exists in reactant molecules in form of potential energy. The smaller the activation energy, the slower the rate of reaction and the greater the activation energy, the faster the rate of reaction. Is this all true?;
Jamie says that reactions may not take place if reactant molecules have energy less than activation energy plus when reactants don’t collide in the right way. Is that really true?;
The rate of the chemical reaction between zinc and dilute hydrochloric acid can be obtained by collecting and measuring the Volume of the hydrogen gas produced. In such a case, to determine the maximum volume of hydrogen gas produced, the mass of Zinc is kept constant. The rate of the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide is too determined by collecting and measuring the volume of hydrogen gas evolved. Is this all true?;
Is it true that the 6 major factors affecting rates of reactions are concentration of the reactants, temperature, surface area of particles, pressure for gaseous reactions, presence of a catalyst and light for photochemical reactions?;
Generally, an increase in the concentration of the reactants increases the rate of a chemical reaction and a decrease in their concentration decreases the rate of the reaction. The higher the concentration, the lower the frequency of collisions per unit time and the faster the products are formed. Conversely, lower concentrations lead to many collisions and a slower rate of reaction. Is this all true?;
A known mass of zinc particles was added to a known concentration of hydrochloric acid in a conical flask fitted with a graduated syringe set at point zero. The stop clock was then immediately started and the volume of hydrogen gas evolved was measured at regular intervals until a constant volume was registered by the syringe. The experiment was repeated using the same mass of zinc powder but with a different concentration of hydrochloric acid. Were those steps accurate?;
The effect of concentration can also be demonstrated using the reaction between dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium thiosulphate solution. Sodium thiosulphate reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce sulphur, sulphur dioxide, water and sodium chloride. Sulphur produced during the reaction makes the solution appear cloudy. Could there be a false statement?;
In an experiment to determine the effect of concentration on the rate of reaction using the reaction between dilute HCl and Sodium thiosulphate, the cross disappears because the reaction forms a precipitate of Sulphur which renders the mixture opaque. In essence, the cross doesn't physically disappear, it simply becomes obscured from view due to the increasing cloudiness caused by the formation of the sulphur precipitate during the reaction. Is that all true?;
Although reaction rates generally slow down with time, with the highest rate often occurring initially when reactant concentrations are at their peak, some complex reactions can deviate from this pattern. Analysing reaction rates involves plotting 1/t against concentration, ideally yielding a straight line signifying a direct proportionality between rate and concentration. Could there be a false statement?;
Generally, increase in temperature increases the rate of a chemical reaction and decrease in temperature decreases the rate of a chemical reaction. Is it true that as temperature increases, more reactant molecules acquire activation energy resulting into an increase in the number of collisions per unit time?; 
In the context of chemical reactions, surface area refers to the accessible portion of a reactant that can interact with other reactant molecules. In chemical reactions, the more surface area the reactants have, the faster they typically react. This relates to the collision theory, where a reaction's speed depends on frequent collisions with enough energy. Could there be a false statement?;
By grinding solids, dissolving them, if soluble, or using smaller particles overall, we increase the exposed surface area. This provides more opportunities for reactant molecules to come into contact with each other, increasing the likelihood of successful collisions and potentially leading to a slower reaction rate. Could there be a false statement?;
The reaction between magnesium ribbon and dilute Sulphuric acid is slower compared to the reaction between magnesium powder and dilute Sulphuric acid. This is so because magnesium ribbon has bigger particles, thus a larger surface area exposed to the reaction with dilute Sulphuric acid. With more surface area available, there are more opportunities for collisions between reactant molecules, leading to a faster reaction. Is this all true?;
Pressure primarily affects gaseous reactions because gas particles are highly compressible. When pressure increases, gas molecules are squeezed into a smaller volume, leading to more frequent collisions, thus an increase in the reaction rate. The Haber process, which uses high pressure for ammonia synthesis, exemplifies this principle. Pressure can also slightly influence the rate of reactions in liquids and even some solids at extremely high pressures. Is this all true?;
Catalysts are remarkable substances that increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed themselves. They work by lowering the activation energy. Powdered catalysts, with their larger surface area, often provide more sites for reactant molecules to interact, leading to a faster reaction compared to bulkier forms. However, once all the catalyst sites are occupied, adding more won't further increase the rate. Is there a false statement?;
Catalysts remain chemically unchanged after a reaction. They are highly efficient, meaning small amounts can significantly influence reaction rates. Many catalysts exhibit specificity. Is this all true?;
Is it true that homogeneous catalysis is where the catalyst and reactants are in different phases whereas in heterogeneous catalysis, they do share the same phase?;
The effect of a catalyst on the rate of reaction can be illustrated by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The rate can be determined by measuring the volume of oxygen liberated at different regular time intervals. The experiment is then repeated using the same volume of hydrogen peroxide but with no catalyst. Is it true that the experiment with the catalyst should show a steeper slope on the graph?;
In the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, various metal oxides act as catalysts, including MnO₂, PbO, and CuO. CuSO₄ speeds up the reaction between zinc metal and dilute hydrochloric acid. Fe is the key catalyst in the Contact Process. The Haber process relies on V₂O₅ as a catalyst. Is this all true?;
Enzymes operate best under specific conditions, often within a narrow temperature and pH range. Temperatures that are too low can render enzymes inactive, while excessively high temperatures can cause them to denature. Changes in pH can alter the enzyme's shape, hindering substrate binding and reducing reaction efficiency. Is this all true?;
In some reactions, the rate of reaction is influenced by light. Reactions which are photosensitive/affected by light are called photochemical reactions and include fermentation. Is that true?;
Is it true that some important reactions that take place in presence of light include photosynthesis, decomposition of hypochlorous acid, and decomposition of silver Chloride?;
Silver bromide and silver iodide, similar to silver chloride, are also photosensitive, making them valuable in photographic films. Light sensitivity also explains why hydrogen peroxide and concentrated nitric acid are stored in dark-coloured bottles. Light can trigger decomposition reactions in these chemicals, altering their properties. Is this all false?;
Most reactions proceed in only the forward direction until when one of the reactants or all the reactants are used up, and then the reaction stops. Such a reaction is known as an irreversible reaction. E.g., the harber process. Could there be a false statement?;
Josephine says that at equilibrium, both the reactants and the products are present. And that a reversible reaction is one which proceeds in both directions, that is, forward and backward. Could she be wrong?;
Temperature, pressure, concentration, and to a lesser extent, catalysts can all influence the position of equilibrium in a reversible reaction. The effect of these factors on equilibrium is summarized by the Le Chatelier's principle which states that when a chemical equilibrium is disturbed externally by a change in one of the factors upon which it depends, the equilibrium shifts in a direction so as to reduce the effects of that change. Is this all true?;
Since the Haber process is exothermic, increasing the temperature stresses the system by adding heat. In this case, the equilibrium will shift towards the endothermic reaction, which is the decomposition of ammonia. Conversely, decreasing the temperature favours the exothermic reaction, leading to a higher yield of ammonia. Is there a false statement?;
Generally, for gaseous equilibrium reactions affected by a change in volume, an increase in pressure or decrease in volume will favour the reaction that increases the total number of gas molecules and a decrease in pressure or increase in volume shall have the opposite effect of decreasing the total number of gas molecules. Is that false?;
If the concentration of a reactant in a reversible reaction is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that consumes that reactant, effectively reducing its concentration. Conversely, removing a product or adding more of another reactant will push the equilibrium towards consuming the added species or replenishing the removed product. Is that false?;
Catalysts don’t have any effect on the position of the equilibrium. In an equilibrium reaction, a catalyst increases the rate of both the forward and backward reactions, i.e., a catalyst enables equilibrium to be attained much faster than when there is no catalyst. Is that true?;
In general, a maximum yield of ammonia is obtained at a very high pressure of 250 to 500 atmospheres, a temperature of about 450˚c, in presence of a catalyst of finely divided iron, and with Al₂O₃ added to make the catalyst more porous, increasing its surface area hence promoting its effectiveness. Is this false?; 
Is the formation of sulphur trioxide in the Contact process favoured by low temperature according to Le Chatelier's principle?;
Is fuming sulphuric acid formed by directly dissolving sulphur trioxide in water?;
Is V₂O₅, the catalyst used in the Contact process to produce sulphuric acid?;
In the Ostwald process, ammonia is converted to NO using a platinum-rhodium catalyst with excess air, while a separate step involving hot water absorbs nitrogen dioxide for nitric acid production. However, the conversion of NO to NO₂ is exothermic, not endothermic. Is there a false statement about the Ostwald process?;
In the Ostwald process, the first stage uses a nickel catalyst and converts ammonia directly to nitric acid. Is this statement false?;
Nitrous acid is the desired product of the Ostwald process, and excess oxygen is used to promote its formation. Is this true?;
