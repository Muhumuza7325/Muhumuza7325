TOPIC 9 ***Organic Chemistry II*** "63 PERIODS". Competency; The learner analyses reaction mechanisms, evaluates reaction pathways and conditions, and designs multi-step syntheses to achieve target compounds (considering alcohols, phenols, carbonyl compounds). SUB-TOPIC 9.1 ***Alcohols and Phenols*** "24 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the structure, nomenclature, physical and chemical properties of alcohols and phenols (u, s); b) evaluate the applications of alcohols and phenols in real life (u, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the structure, nomenclature, preparation and physical properties of alcohols and phenols, discuss your findings in groups and make reports (preparation of phenols not required). b) Individually, search for information about the chemical properties of alcohols and phenols and their mechanisms, discuss your findings in groups and make reports. c) In pairs, use problem-based learning to carry out exercises on chemical reactions of alcohols and phenols and their mechanisms. d) In groups, perform test tube experiments on the identification and reactions of alcohols (include distinction between classes) and phenols and write reports. a) In groups, analyse case studies to evaluate the applications of alcohols and phenols in real life and make presentations. b) In groups, carry out projects to make useful products from alcohols and phenols. SUB-TOPIC 9.2 ***Carbonyl Compounds (Aldehydes and Ketones)*** "24 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the structure, preparation and reactivity of aldehydes and ketones, identifying how functional groups affect chemical behaviour in different environments (u, s); b) evaluate the different applications of carbonyl compounds in real life (u, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the structure, nomenclature, preparation (by oxidation of alcohols) and physical properties of carbonyl compounds, discuss your findings in groups and make presentations. b) Individually, search for information about chemical properties of carbonyl compounds and their mechanisms, discuss your findings in groups and write reports. c) In pairs, use problem-based learning to carry out exercises on chemical reactions of carbonyl compounds and their mechanisms: i) Addition reactions ii) Condensation reactions (hydroxylamine and Bradyâ€™s reagent) iii) Redox reactions iv) Reaction with iodine. d) In groups, perform test tube experiments on the identification and reactions of carbonyl compounds and write reports. a) work in groups to analyse case studies involving applications of carbonyl compounds in real life and present your findings. b) In groups, identify and carry out projects to produce products from carbonyl compounds and write reports. SUB-TOPIC 9.3 ***Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives*** "15 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the structure, nomenclature, preparation and properties of carboxylic acids and their derivatives (esters, acyl chlorides); b) evaluate the different applications of carboxylic acids and their derivatives in real life (u, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the structure, nomenclature, preparation (by hydrolysis of esters and oxidation) and properties of carboxylic acids and their derivatives, discuss your findings in groups and make reports. b) In groups, use the problem-solving approach to perform exercises on reactions of carboxylic acids and their derivatives and make reports. c) In pairs, carry out laboratory tests on the reactions of carboxylic acids and identification of the functional group in acids. a) In groups, analyse case studies involving applications of carboxylic acids and their derivatives in real life and write reports. b) work in groups to identify and carry out projects to make products from carboxylic acids and their derivatives and make reports;
