TOPIC 8 ***Equilibria II*** "45 PERIODS". Competency; The learner applies principles of physical equilibria and colligative properties to analyse and predict changes in physical systems, including phase transitions and effects of solute concentration on solution behaviour, in scientific and real-world contexts. SUB-TOPIC 8.1 ***Physical Equilibria*** "27 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) evaluate the principles of Raoult’s law in ideal and non-ideal solutions, distinguishing their behaviours under varying conditions (u, s, v/a); b) evaluate properties of two component systems involving immiscible liquid mixtures and their applications in real-life (u, s, v/a); c) analyse the behaviour of solid-liquid mixtures and their applications in industry (u, s, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about two component systems involving miscible liquids, Raoult’s law, and non-ideal solutions, discuss your findings in groups, and prepare reports. b) In pairs, apply problem-based learning to solve problems using Raoult’s law and its deviations and write reports. c) analyse data by drawing vapour pressure/boiling point versus mole fraction and interpreting the phase diagrams for ideal and non-ideal solutions. d) In groups, use digital simulations (e.g., PhET interactive simulations) to visualise molecular interactions in ideal and non-ideal solutions. e) In groups, discuss how the principle of separation of miscible liquids is applied in the distillation and separation of azeotropic mixtures. a) Individually, search for information about the properties of immiscible liquids, steam distillation and solvent extraction, discuss your findings in groups and make reports. b) In pairs, use problem-based learning to solve mathematical problems on steam distillation (molecular mass determination and composition of distillate). c) In groups, carry out experiments to determine partition coefficients between immiscible liquid mixtures. d) In pairs, use problem-based learning to solve mathematical problems on partition coefficient and its application in solvent extraction. a) Individually, search for information about solid-liquid mixtures, phase diagrams for simple eutectic mixtures, and their applications, discuss your findings, and write reports. b) work in pairs to construct phase diagrams for solid-liquid systems with simple eutectics and explain their features. SUB-TOPIC 8.2 ***Colligative Properties*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to analyse colligative properties such as boiling point elevation and freezing point depression, and relate them to solute concentration in different solutions (u, s). a) Individually, search for information about the effect of adding non-volatile solutes to solvents on boiling point, freezing point, osmotic pressure, and vapour pressure, discuss your findings and make reports. b) In groups, carry out experiments to demonstrate the effect of adding non-volatile solute to a solvent on freezing point (using naphthalene or stearic acid), boiling point, and vapour pressure. c) In pairs, carry out exercises to calculate molecular mass and changes in boiling/freezing points with varied solute concentrations.
