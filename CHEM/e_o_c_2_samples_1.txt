Item 1 [UNEB Sample]: Onyera, living in an area where they use bore hole water, slid, fell and his white shirt became dirty. He decided to use a detergent to clean his shirt. The shirt remained with some brown spots yet he had rinsed it several times. Task: As a chemistry learner;#(a) Point out the problem Onyera made when choosing a product.#Onyera used a soapy detergent (or soap) instead of a soapless detergent (02 scores).#(b) Help Onyera understand how the product works.#The dirt is held on the cloth by a layer of oil.#Detergents (soaps) facilitate the emulsification and removal of grease (02 scores).#Alternatively;#Detergents facilitate breakdown of fats into small parts. A soap molecule contains two parts; namely; the water-soluble/polar carboxylate head / hydrophilic end or lipophobic head and non-polar tail/fat-soluble part / hydrophobic part/lipophilic part.#During washing, soap acts by lowering the surface tension between water and oil/grease/other water insoluble materials and also emulsifies them.#The hydro-carbon tail becomes attached to dirt /oil /fat while the polar head dissolves in water. With constant agitation, the dirt is pulled off the cloth and gets dispersed in water as tiny droplets which are then poured away. The cloth is then rinsed several times and dried (02 scores).#(c) Advise Onyera on the challenges associated with the long-term use of the product.#a) Soap contains chemicals that can cause:#Skin burns / blisters / irritation and hence pain or cancer.#Eye redness and pain; hence loss of vision - Mitigation can be done by thoroughly washing the affected areas (or irrigation of the affected areas) like skin or eyes.#b) Soapless detergents contain phosphates which cause algae bloom/alagal bloom and hence water pollution. N.B. Algae/algal bloom already means accumulation (03 scores).#a) Similarities:#Both soapy detergents and soapless detergents are salts of Organic acids of long carbon chain.#Both soapy detergents and soapless detergents are effective cleansing agents in soft water / rain water.#b) (i) Differences; Soapy detergents:#Forms scum with hard water.#Gentle on skin during cleansing.#Sodium salts of carboxylic acid of long chains and cannot be used in strongly acidic solutions.#Biodegradable#b) (ii) Soapless detergents:#Does not form scum with any form of water.#Not gentle on skin during washing.#Sodium salts of long chain benzene sulphonic acids and can be used in strongly acidic solutions.#Non-biodegradable (02 scores).#[Tr. Kajubi Charles]: a) Onyera used soap to wash or used a soapy detergent.#b) The product works by lowering the surface tension of water enabling it to spread and wet the material to clean more effectively. This facilitates breaking and dispersing of the grease (dirt) particles.#Soap molecule has two parts, the hydrophilic head (water loving) that is soluble (dissolves) in water and the hydrophobic tail (dirt loving) that is insoluble in water (it dissolves the oil/fat/grease).#Dirt on a cloth is held by an oil film. During washing, the soap molecules spread in water lowering the surface tension of water, the water penetrates the cloth (wetting) allowing soap molecules to reach the dirt particles in the cloth.#The hydrophobic tail (dirt loving part) surrounds the dirt particles forming micelles isolating the dirt particles from the cloth while the hydrophilic head (water loving) remains suspended in water, making the micelles soluble in water(emulsification). This disperses the dirt particles in water, creating an emulsion.#Due to repeated agitation, the micelles disperse into water leaving the cloth free from dirt. Agitation also breaks down larger dirt particles into smaller ones which are then surrounded by new soap molecules.#The cloth is then rinsed with clean water several times to remove the micelles from the cloth surface making it clean.#Bore hole water he is using is permanent hard water containing Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ dissolved in it since it passes through rocks underground. So, when soap a sodium stearate salt is added to water containing such ions during washing, the soap reacts with Mg²+ and Ca²+ forming the brown substance that remain in your cloth called scum.#Mg²⁺(aq) + St⁻(aq) → MgSt₂(s).#This makes soap ineffective during washing hence leaving your cloth with brown spots on it even with several rinsing in clean water. So Onyera should use a soap less detergent or a chemical like washing soda to remove the hardness in water. This shall enable him wash his clothes and they remain with no brown spots.#c) Soap contains chemicals that can cause skin burns and irritation and hence pain or cancer.#Eye redness and pain; hence loss of vision.#All the above effects can be prevented by thoroughly washing the affected areas like skin or eyes with fresh clean water.#Some soapless detergents contain phosphates which cause algae bloom/algal bloom and hence water pollution

Item 1: An old man living on the outskirts of a village has become troubled by his well water. Whenever he uses it to wash clothes or dishes, he needs a large amount of a soapy detergent to create lather, and stubborn brown marks remain on the items. The man also noticed a rough, scale-like layer forming at the bottom of his kettle around the heating element after repeatedly boiling his well water. Interestingly, these issues don’t arise when he uses rainwater.#Confused and increasingly anxious, he worries that something beyond his understanding, possibly supernatural, may be affecting the water. Task: As a chemistry student; #(a) Help the man to;#i) Understand the two different types of water (02 scores)#ii) Understand how the water from the well is formed (03 scores)#iii) Understand how the boiler’s scale forms, its effects on the kettle's performance, and how it can be removed or prevented. Use chemical equations to illustrate your work (04 scores)#iv) Understand why rainwater does not cause the same issues as the well water (02 scores)#(b) What should the man expect if he uses a soapless detergent for washing instead? (02 scores)#(c) Advise the man on the possible ways of removing those ions and improve the quality of that water from the well. Use chemical equations to illustrate your work (04 scores)
