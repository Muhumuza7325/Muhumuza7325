Qn. During the chemistry tour which took place around lake Katwe, learners took a sample of water from the lake with an interest of identifying which elements are present in the water sample they have got. They took the sample of the water for laboratory test and the result from the test showed that, the water sample contained an element X with atomic number 12 and mass number 24 and it also contained an element Y with atomic number 17 and mass number 35.
(a) What do you understand by the following terms?
(i) Atomic number    (ii) Atomic mass
(b) Write the electronic configurations of the atoms X and Y.
(c) State the group, period and valency of the atoms X and Y and give a reason of each.
(d) Draw the electronic structures of the ions of X and Y.
(e) Write the electronic configuration of the ions X and Y and the formula formed by each.
(f) State three physical properties that differentiate elements X and Y.;

Qn. A group of scientists is tasked with designing materials for use in various industries. They are considering a selection of elements from the first 20 elements of the periodic table to determine which ones are best suited for specific applications.
a) Explain with a reason, how the scientists would categorise these elements.  Where in the Periodic Table could each category be located, and why are these categories positioned in specific regions?

b) The scientists need to select elements for particular industrial purposes. Based on the physical properties of the elements, which ones would be most suitable for: Electrical wiring, building construction, making bells, making jewellery, and production of insulating materials. For each selection, explain the properties of the elements that make them ideal for these applications.

c) The electron arrangement in each element is crucial for its selection. For one element from each category, provide the electronic structure and configuration. Based on this information, deduce its period, group, and valency in the Periodic Table. Additionally, write a chemical formula of any compound formed by the selected element.








d) The scientists are also exploring the formation of ions. Using the electronic structure of a selected element, demonstrate how both a cation and an anion can form. Include the electronic configurations of the ions and explain the changes that occur during ion formation.

Qn. We are surrounded by matter and the variety of the matter in the world and the universe is surprising; thus, the need to classify substances. Basing on their characteristics, substances can be classified as elements, compounds and mixtures. The elements in the periodic table can be further classified into metals, nonmetals, metalloids, lanthanides and actinides.
a) With a reason, give an example (name & symbol) of an element that is a metal and one that is a nonmetal (02 scores)
(b) An atom of element of X has atomic number, 20 and mass number, 40. 
(i) Draw the electronic structure of the element (02 scores)
(ii) Write the electronic configuration of the element (01 score)
(iii) State the group and period of the element (02 scores)
(iv) Write the formula of the oxide and nitrate of X (02 scores)
(v) How many neutrons does the element have? (01 score);
