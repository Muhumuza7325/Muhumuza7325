Theme ***Air and environment*** "@OMD". TOPIC 3.1 ***AIR*** "10 PERIODS". Competency; The learner appreciates that air is a mixture of gases in which oxygen is the active constituent, and he/she can describe processes that may affect air quality. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Understand that air is a mixture of different gases that can be separated and used (k, u); b) Understand how air pollution can affect the atmosphere (u); c) Understand and appreciate that processes such as burning and rusting/corrosion use oxygen from the air to form oxides (k, u). [Assignment 1] {With reasons, identify air as a mixture and explain in detail, how the different gases in air can be separated and used}. The atmosphere is a layer of air surrounding the earth. Air is a mixture of gases. Its composition varies at different times and in different places. Air is a mixture and not a compound because: (i) Air can be made by mixing nitrogen and oxygen and its formation is not accompanied by heat or light changes (energy changes). (ii) The nitrogen and oxygen (and other gases) in air can be separated from each other by physical means. (iii) The properties of air are just the average of the properties of nitrogen and oxygen. (iv) The proportions of nitrogen and oxygen (and other gases) in air are not definite, they vary from place to place and from time to time. Composition of Air. The approximate composition of air by volume is as follows: Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Carbon dioxide (0.03%), Inert/rare/noble gases (1.0%) and Water vapour – variable (0.5%-4.0%). Air also consists of minute quantities of other gases (such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, traces of methane and ozone), solid particles (such as pollen grains, soot, smoke, dust particles etc.,) and microorganisms such as bacteria. Oxygen is the reactive gas on which combustion, rusting and respiration depend. Nitrogen dilutes the oxygen and slows down the three processes. Noble gases such as helium, argon and neon are very inert. Detecting the presence of atmospheric gases and water vapour. 1) Carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide is passed through lime water, the lime water turns milky. 2) Water vapour. The presence of water vapour in the atmosphere can be detected using anhydrous copper (II) sulphate or cobalt (II) chloride paper. When water vapour gets into contact with anhydrous copper (II) sulphate, it turns it from white to blue or when water gets into contact with blue cobalt (II) chloride paper, it turns it to pink. 3) Oxygen. Since oxygen supports burning, its presence in the atmosphere can be detected using a glowing splint. When a glowing splint is lowered into a gas jar containing oxygen, the glowing splint relights (chemical test). As well, burning e.g., of a candle takes place in the open, due to the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere. 4) Nitrogen. Nitrogen is inert and very difficult to detect. However, when oxygen and carbon dioxide have been removed from the atmosphere, the remaining gases constitute mainly nitrogen. Uses of the atmosphere. The atmosphere supports life in many ways: 1) The atmosphere filters off the harmful ultra violet radiations from the sun, thus protecting life. 2) It provides oxygen needed for respiration and combustion (burning). 3) Nitrogen is inert and therefore slows down various chemical reactions such as burning and rusting. Nitrogen, is also needed by plants. 4) Carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis by green plants. 5) Water vapour is necessary for rain formation. It also provides moisture to sooth our bodies and make plants cool. 6) Noble gases provide inert conditions for various chemical reactions. Other uses of noble gases include: i) Helium is used to fill balloons because its light. ii) Neon is used in electric sign boards for advertisement. iii) Argon is used in electric bulbs. Video17.Components_of_Air_and_their_uses.mp4. • In pairs or individually, research on: • the composition of air, • the percentage of each chemical from a pie chart of the composition of air; • and what else might be in the air. [Assignment 2] {Explain processes such as burning and rusting/corrosion that use oxygen from the air to form oxides}. Combustion. This is a chemical reaction in which a substance combines with air to liberate energy. When substances burn in air, they combine with oxygen of the air to form oxides, sometimes peroxides, and liberate energy. The elements can be heated on an asbestos paper or porous pot or ceramic wool or crucible or metal bottle top. Combustion can be slow (with no flame) or rapid (rapid combustion produces flame). Examples of rapid combustion are: burning bush and burning charcoal while examples of slow combustion include: respiration, digestion of food, rusting of iron, and fermentation/decay. Experiment to determine the percentage by volume of oxygen in air using copper. Figure228.1.7.air_image_001.jpg. Put some copper turnings into a combustion tube fitted to two syringes. Suck air into one of the gas syringes up to 100cm³ and plug its mouth with cotton wool. Heat the combustion tube containing copper turnings strongly and pass the air over copper turnings, by pushing the plunger of the syringe containing air to an empty syringe, until there is no further change in the volume of air in the syringes. Allow the combustion tube to cool and record the volume of air in the syringes. The decrease in volume of air is approximately 21cm³, which is 21% of oxygen in air. Note: The cotton wool allows air to easily be blown from one syringe to another without the copper turnings entering the syringes. At the end of the experiment, the brown copper turnings turned black, copper (II) oxide was produced. (Refer to your previous notes and use this data to calculate the percentage of air used up in the combustion of copper: Y = 100cm³, X = 80cm³). Experiment to determine the percentage of air used in combustion using phosphorus. Procedure. Place a small piece of phosphorus in a crucible, float the crucible in a water trough and place a bell jar over it. Measure and record the height of air (Xcm) in the bell jar. Ignite the phosphorus by touching it with the end of a hot wire and quickly replace the stopper of the jar. Observation. The phosphorus burns with a bright yellow flame producing dense white fumes. The water level drops for a while, due to the increased pressure as a result of expansion of air; It then rises as the white fumes dissolve in the water. When phosphorus stops burning and the water level comes to rest, measure the height of the air left in the bell jar (Ycm). Results. Height of air in the bell jar before burning phosphorus = Xcm. Height of air in the bell jar after burning phosphorus = Ycm. Air used in the burning of phosphorus = (X-Y)cm. Percentage of air used in the burning of phosphorus = ((X-Y)cm/X)*100%. (Use this data and calculate the percentage of air used up in the combustion of phosphorus: Y= 55.8cm, X= 70.5cm). Conclusion. The percentage volume of air used in the burning of phosphorus was 20.8%, indicating that the gas used was oxygen. The remaining gas in the gas jar was mainly nitrogen. Determining the percentage of oxygen in air using a burning candle. Fix a candle on a gas jar and stand. Place the stand and candle in a trough and add water until the water level is about 2cm³ up the candle. Lower a dry gas jar quickly over the burning candle. Lift the gas and push a burning splint in the gas. Observation. The candle is extinguished after a short time and the water level rises in the trough. Conclusion. Some part of air was used up by the burning candle. The water rose to occupy the space of the used air. The part used up is about 20% by volume. This part of air is oxygen. Experiment to determine products formed when hydrocarbons burn in air. A hydrocarbon is a compound containing hydrogen and carbon only. Examples of hydrocarbons include: a candle, natural gas, petrol and paraffin. To find out what substance is formed when a candle burns. Figure229.1.7.air_image_002.jpg. When a candle is lit, the suction pump is switched on. This pulls the gaseous products of the burning candle and keeps it burning. The products are passed through a cooled U-tube and lime water. Observation. A colourless liquid condenses in the U-tube and turns white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate to blue. The lime water turns milky. Conclusion. When a candle burns, water and carbon dioxide are produced as the only products showing that the gas used up in the combustion is oxygen. Candle + Air → Water + Carbon dioxide. To find out if there is a change in mass when a metal burns in Air. Figure230.1.7.air_image_003.jpg. Clean the magnesium ribbon with sand paper. Weigh 0.5g of magnesium ribbon; put it in a crucible and close the lid. Weigh the mass of the crucible, lid and magnesium. Heat the crucible gently, then strongly. Raise the lid from time to time to allow in air to enter and combine with magnesium. Allow to cool and weigh the crucible, lid and magnesium oxide. Observation. There is increase in mass when a substance burns in air. The increase in mass is because the metal combines with oxygen of the air to form an oxide. Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide. Corrosion. Corrosion is the gradual degradation of materials, usually metals, due to chemical reactions with their environment. The reaction between metals and the atmosphere causes the metals to lose their structural properties like shape, colour, strength, etc. Examples of corrosion include: rusting of iron, reaction of copper metal with the atmosphere (oxygen and carbondioxide) to form a green solid of copper (II) carbonate; reaction of aluminium with atmospheric oxygen to form aluminium oxide. Self-protection from corrosion: Some metals are self-protecting from corrosion e.g., magnesium and aluminium react with the air to form oxides which form a thin layer on the surface of the metal. These oxide coatings prevent air from reaching the metal beneath it hence the metal is protected from further corrosion. Unfortunately, iron cannot protect its self in this way because the rust formed is porous and can allow air and water to reach the metal below it causing further corrosion. Rusting of iron. When iron or steel wool is left in damp air for some time, the iron becomes covered with a reddish–brown substance termed as rust. The rust forms only on the outside of the metal. Rust is soft and readily drops off and then the metal below starts to rust. Rust is hydrated Iron (III) Oxide, Fe₂O₃.xH₂O. Rusting is a chemical change in which iron combines with water in the presence of air to form a reddish-brown substance. Iron + Oxygen + Water → Iron rust; 4Fe(s) + 3O₂(g) + 2xH₂O(l) → 2Fe₂O₃.xH₂O(s). Rusting corrodes and wears off iron and reduces its strength. Rusting is a slow process. To find conditions needed for Iron to rust. (a) To show that iron does not rust in dry Air. Figure231.1.7.air_image_004.jpg. Place some clean iron nails at the bottom of a glass test tube. Push in some cotton wool half way down the test tube. Add anhydrous calcium chloride above the cotton wool to keep the air in the tube dry. Close the mouth of the test tube with cotton wool and leave for several days. Observation. The iron nails do not rust. (b) To show that iron does not rust in air–free water. Figure232.1.7.air_image_005.jpg. Boil water in a test tube, to remove any dissolved air from it. Put some clean nails in the water in a glass test tube. Add oil or Vaseline to the water to form a layer on the surface. This keeps air out of the water. Leave the set up to stand for some days. Observation. The iron nails do not rust. (c) To show that iron rusts in both Air and Water. Figure233.1.7.air_image_006.jpg. Put some iron nails in a glass test tube. Pour some water in the test tube and leave to stand for some days. Observation. The iron nails rusted after a few days. Conclusion. Oxygen and water are necessary for rusting. NB: In an experiment to investigate the conditions necessary for rusting, the 3 setups are often carried out at once. Effects of dissolved substances on rusting. Presence of dissolved salts or acids in water tend to accelerate rusting while alkaline solutions tend to slow down rusting, therefore iron will rust faster in a salty or acidic solution than in tap water. Advantages of rusting. It decomposes disposed iron and increases the iron content in the soil necessary for plants. It creates and increases market for the iron manufacturing industry. Rust is used for making paints. Disadvantages of rusting. It weakens and wears the metal. It causes the metal to lose shape. It makes metals to appear dark. It increases friction in machines. It increases the maintenance costs of materials made of iron. It contaminates tinned food. Methods of preventing rusting. Rusting is prevented by keeping away water and air from iron. This can be achieved by: 1) Oiling or greasing the iron: A layer of oil or grease is put on a metal. This cuts off air and stops metal tools and parts of machines from rusting. The oil or grease does not stay on the iron for long, and a fresh layer must be put on the metal after some time. 2) Painting or tarring: Just like oil or grease, paint or tar cuts off air and stops materials made of iron from rusting. Paint is usually put on the iron parts of windows, doors, bicycles, cars etc. Tar is used instead of paint in parts that we do not see, e.g., bottom parts of bridges, ships. Tar is cheaper and lasts longer than paint. 3) Coating with other metals: A layer of another metal that does not rust is put on the iron. The coating of iron with other metals is referred to as metal plating. The iron can be coated with zinc, tin, chromium, silver and nickel to prevent rusting from occurring. Iron coated with tin is called tin plate. Tin plate is used for making the ‘tins’ that contain food, paint, and petrol. Tin plate rusts quickly if the coat of tin is broken at any point because iron is more reactive than tin and therefore will react with the air and moisture forming rust. Iron coated with zinc is called galvanized iron. It is used for making roofs, bath tabs, buckets, etc. It is better than tin-plate because it does not rust easily even if the zinc coat is scratched because, zinc being more reactive than iron will react with air forming solids that seal off the scratch. Iron coated with chromium is chromium–plated. It is used on motor cars, bicycles and other things where a nice appearance is needed because it shines like silver. Iron coated with nickel also prevents rusting from occurring. 4) Enameling. Enamel is very hard and does not let air or water pass through into the iron. It is used in cookers and refrigerators. It has no action on food and therefore quite safe to use on cooking vessels. Iron rusts easily if enamel is broken. 5) Alloying. In stainless steel, iron is mixed with carbon, chromium and nickel to prevent it from rusting. Knives, scissors and other tools are made from stainless steel. 6) Sacrificial protection. The iron being protected from rusting is connected via a wire to a block of a more reactive metal (magnesium and zinc are commonly used). The magnesium or zinc being more reactive than the iron will react in preference to iron thus sacrificing to protect the iron. This method sometimes is referred to as cathodic protection i.e., the iron being protected acts as the cathode and the more reactive metal acts as the anode, (This shall be expanded in form four). Video20.Corrosion.mp4. • In groups, discuss what is necessary for wood to burn and understand that oxygen is the active ingredient in air that allows burning to take place and causes iron to rust. • In groups, plan an investigation of the factors that affect the rate of rusting of iron, using the scientific method. Steps include: • selecting apparatus and materials; • making predictions based on prior knowledge and proposing a hypothesis; • recording observations and measurements; • interpreting observations and reporting results; • comparing observations and results with other groups; • discussing and developing explanations, conditions to include a clean nail placed: • in air where water is removed with anhydrous Calcium Chloride; • in normal air containing water vapour; • in tap water; • in boiled water (where air has been removed by boiling). Oxygen. Oxygen is a gas that occupies 21% by volume of air. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere can be increased by processes such as photosynthesis and can be reduced by processes like combustion, respiration, rusting, germination etc. Laboratory Preparation of oxygen. Oxygen can be prepared in the laboratory from oxygen rich compounds such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), potassium chlorate (KClO₃), potassium manganate (VII) (KMnO₄), and sodium peroxide (Na₂O₂). On a large-scale, oxygen is prepared by electrolysis of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and fractional distillation of liquid air. (a) From hydrogen peroxide, H₂O₂ (Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide). Figure234.1.7.air_image_007.jpg. The gas jar is filled with water and inverted over a gas jar stand. Manganese (IV) oxide is added in the flask. The apparatus is then arranged as shown above. Hydrogen peroxide is added drop by drop to the manganese (IV) oxide through the dropping funnel. Rapid effervescence occurs at room temperature, giving off a colourless gas. Manganese (IV) oxide acts as a catalyst. Without it, the decomposition would take place but at a very slow rate. The rate of decomposition can also be increased by exposing the hydrogen peroxide to sunlight. A catalyst is a substance which changes the speed of a chemical reaction but remains chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction. The colorless gas, when not required dry, is collected over water because it is slightly soluble in water. The gas can also be collected by upward delivery as it’s less dense than air. Hydrogen peroxide + heat → oxygen(g) + water(l). 2H₂O₂(aq/l) → H₂O(l) + O₂(g). NB: If the gas is required dry, it’s passed through concentrated sulphuric acid in a wash bottle or Solid anhydrous calcium chloride in a u-tube to dry it and then collected using a syringe. Figure235.1.7.air_image_008.jpg. Using the same setup as above, hydrogen peroxide can be added drop by drop from the funnel into potassium permanganate in the presence of dilute sulphuric acid. Oxygen is liberated until when all the potassium permanganate is decomposed and the solution turns colorless. 5H₂O₂(aq/l) + 2KMnO₄(aq) + 3H₂SO₄(aq) → K₂SO₄(aq) + 2MnSO₄(aq) + 8H₂O(l) + 5O₂(g). (b) From sodium peroxide. When sodium peroxide is used for the preparation of oxygen, the sodium peroxide is placed in the flat-bottomed flask and water in the dropping funnel; The water is then run into the sodium peroxide and effervescence occurs as oxygen gas is given off. 2Na₂O₂(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 4NaOH(aq) + O₂(g). (c) From potassium chlorate. Figure236.1.7.air_image_009.jpg. A mixture of potassium chlorate and manganese (IV) oxide is heated in a hard glass tube. The potassium chlorate decomposes giving off colorless oxygen gas and white residue of potassium chloride. The gas is collected by upward delivery as it’s less dense than air. Industrial manufacture of oxygen. Oxygen is manufactured on an industrial scale by fractional distillation of liquid air (check notes on classification of substances). • In groups, examine a fractionating column and draw on research to discuss how different liquids have different boiling points, and how this is used to separate them into fractions (check previous notes). • Individually or in pairs, research on and explain how oxygen and nitrogen can be separated from liquid air using a fractionating column, and then discuss in groups (check previous notes). Properties of oxygen. Physical Properties. 1) It’s a colourless, odorless and tasteless gas. 2) It’s neutral to litmus. 3) It’s slightly soluble in cold water. 4) It’s slightly less dense than air. Chemical properties of oxygen. Oxygen supports the burning of most metals and non-metals forming majorly basic and acidic oxides respectively. Metal + oxygen → metallic oxide (most of which are basic). Non-metals + oxygen → non-metallic oxides (most of which are acidic). (a) Metals: Metals burn in oxygen forming majorly basic oxides which when dissolved in water form basic or alkaline solutions i.e., solutions that turn red litmus paper blue and have no effect on blue litmus paper. 1) Potassium. Potassium burns in oxygen with a lilac flame (purple flame) forming white ash of potassium oxide. 2K(s) + ½O₂(g) → K₂O(s). The potassium oxide dissolves in water to form an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide. K₂O(s) + H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq). 2) Sodium. Sodium melts and then burns in excess oxygen with a brilliant yellow flame to form a yellow solid (powder) of sodium peroxide. 2Na(s) + O₂(g) → Na₂O₂(s). The sodium peroxide dissolves in water forming an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide with evolution of a colorless gas that relights a glowing splint (oxygen). 2Na₂O₂(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 4NaOH(aq) + O₂(g). However, in limited oxygen supply, sodium burns with a bright yellow flame to form a white solid of sodium oxide. 4Na(s) + O₂(g) → 2Na₂O(s). The sodium oxide dissolves in water forming an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide only. Na₂O(s) + H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq). Note: Sodium and potassium are kept under oil/paraffin since they are very reactive and react violently with both air and water. 3) Calcium. Calcium burns in oxygen with a bright red flame to form white calcium oxide. 2Ca(s) + O₂(g) → 2CaO(s). The oxide slightly dissolves in water to form calcium hydroxide, which turns litmus blue. CaO(s) + H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq). 4) Magnesium. It burns in oxygen with a very bright white flame forming a white ash (powder) of magnesium oxide. 2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s). The oxide dissolves slightly in water to form an alkaline solution of magnesium hydroxide solution that turns litmus blue. MgO(s) + H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂(aq). 5) Iron. Iron burns in oxygen with bright sparks to form blue-black beads of tri-iron tetra oxide. 3Fe(s) + 2O₂(g) → Fe₃O₄(s). The oxide does not dissolve in water and has no effect on litmus. 6) Lead. Lead melts into shinny beads and finally forms a yellow powder of lead (II) oxide. 2Pb(s) + O₂(g) → 2PbO(s). 7) Copper. Copper metal burns with a blue flame, turning red hot. On cooling, black powder of copper (II) oxide forms. 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s). The copper (II) oxide is insoluble in water and therefore has no effect on litmus paper. (b) Non-metals: Non-metals such as carbon, sulphur and phosphorus burn in oxygen to form acidic oxides (acid anhydrides). These oxides dissolve in water to form acidic solutions that turn blue litmus paper red and have no effect on red litmus paper. An acid anhydride is an oxide of a non-metal that dissolves in water to form an acid. 1) Carbon. Carbon burns in oxygen with an orange flame and becomes red hot (makes bright sparks, but doesn’t melt) forming carbon dioxide, a colourless gas. Carbon dioxide turns calcium hydroxide milky. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form carbonic acid which turns blue litmus pale red. C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g). CO₂(g) + H₂O(l) ↔ H₂CO₃(aq). 2) Sulphur. Sulphur melts and then burns with a bright blue flame, forming cloudy white fumes with a pungent; chocking smell. The gas formed is a mixture of sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide. S(s) + O₂(g) → SO₂(g). 2S(s) + 3O₂(g) → 2SO₃(g). The sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide dissolve in water forming Sulphurous and Sulphuric acids respectively. SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₃(aq) (Sulphurous acid). SO₃(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₄(aq) (sulphuric acid). 3) Phosphorus. White phosphorus burns with a very bright yellow flame forming dense white fumes. Red phosphorus burns less readily with a yellow flame. The white fumes are a mixture of phosphorus (V) oxide and phosphorus (III) oxide. The oxides dissolve in water to form phosphoric and phosphorous acids respectively which turn blue litmus red. P₄(s) + 5O₂(g) → P₄O₁₀(s). P₄(s) + 3O₂(g) → P₄O₆(s). P₂O₅(s) + 3H₂O(l) → 2H₃PO₄(aq) (Phosphoric acid). P₂O₃(s) + 3H₂O(l) → 2H₃PO₃(aq) (Phosphorus acid). Note: Phosphorus is kept in water because if it is in contact with air, it smoulders (burns slowly without a flame giving off white smoke). Video21.Burning_metals_in_oxygen.mp4. Uses of oxygen. 1) Oxygen is used by living things in the process of respiration. 2) Oxygen is essential for combustion/burning therefore providing a heat source for various activities like cooking, burning wastes etc. 3) Oxygen when mixed with ethyne, produces a very hot flame, an oxy-acetylene flame, for welding and cutting heavy metals. 4) In the manufacture of steel (In the conversion of pig iron to steel). It’s used to remove impurities in iron. 5) Liquid oxygen is used in space rockets. A mixture of liquid oxygen and hydrogen is a powerful rocket fuel. 6) Liquid oxygen can be used as explosives in mines when mixed with charcoal and petrol. 7) It is used to aid breathing where the natural supply of oxygen is insufficient e.g., in high altitude flying or climbing, in sea diving and also in hospitals for patients. Classification of oxides. An oxide is a compound of oxygen with another element. The following are major classes of oxides (types of oxides). 1) Acidic oxides: Acidic oxides are oxides of non-metals which dissolve in water to form acids. They are called acid anhydrides. Examples. Sulphur dioxide, (SO₂). Sulphur trioxide, (SO₃). Nitrogen dioxide, (NO₂). Carbondioxide, (CO₂). SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₃(aq). SO₃(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₄(aq). These oxides react with alkalis to form salt and water. E.g., carbondioxide reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate(salt) and water. CO₂(g) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na₂CO₃(aq) + H₂O(l). 2) Basic Oxides. Basic oxides are oxides of metals which react with acids to form a salt and water only. Examples: Magnesium oxide, (MgO). Copper (II) oxide, (CuO). Calcium oxide, (CaO). Magnesium oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce magnesium chloride (salt) and water. MgO(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl₂(aq) + H₂O(l). Copper (II) oxide reacts with sulphuric acid to form copper (II) sulphate (salt) and water. CuO(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → CuSO₄(aq) + H₂O(l). Basic oxides dissolve in water forming alkaline solutions. CuO(s) + H₂O(l) → Cu(OH)₂(aq). 3) Amphoteric oxides. Amphoteric oxides are oxides which have both acidic and basic properties when they react with acids and alkalis. Examples: Aluminium oxide, (Al₂O₃). Zinc oxide, (ZnO). Lead (II) oxide (PbO). Zinc oxide reacts with sulphuric acid to form zinc sulphate (salt) and water. ZnO(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + H₂O(l). Aluminium oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid forming aluminium chloride (salt) and water. Al₂O₃(s) + 6HCl(aq) → 2AlCl₃(aq) + 3H₂O(l). Reaction of amphoteric oxides with alkalis. Zinc oxide reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium zincate (salt). ZnO(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + H₂O(l) → Na₂Zn(OH)₄(aq). Aluminium oxide reacts with sodium hydroxide forming a salt called sodium aluminate. Al₂O₃(s) + 2NaOH(aq)+ 3H₂O(l) → 2NaAl(OH)₄(aq). 4) Neutral oxides. These are oxides which have neither acidic nor basic properties. They don’t react with water to form acids and neither do they react with acids. Examples. Water, (H₂O). Carbon monoxide, (CO). Nitrogen monoxide, (NO). Dinitrogen oxide, (N₂O). Neutral oxides are usually lower oxides of non-metals. 5) Mixed oxides: These are oxides which react like a mixture of two simpler oxides. Examples: Tri-lead tetra oxide reacts like a mixture of lead (II) oxide and lead (IV) oxide. Pb₃O₄(s) → 2PbO(s) + PbO₂(s). Tri iron tetra oxide reacts like a mixture of iron (II) oxide and iron (III) oxide. Fe₃O₄(s) → Fe₂O₃(s) + FeO(s). Dinitrogen tetra oxide reacts like a mixture of dinitrogen trioxide and dinitrogen pentoxide. 2N₂O₄(g) → N₂O₃(g) + N₂O₅(g). 6) Peroxides. These are oxides that contain twice as much oxygen as they would contain in their normal oxides. Examples: Sodium peroxide, Na₂O₂. Hydrogen Peroxide, H₂O₂. Barium peroxide, BaO₂. Potassium peroxide, K₂O₂. Peroxides, except H₂O₂, react with dilute acids to form hydrogen peroxide. Electrochemical series (Reactivity series). This is the arrangement of elements in the order of their readiness to react with other substances. The most reactive elements are placed at the top of the series and the least reactive elements are placed at the bottom. Metal competition for oxygen. Metals which are higher in the reactivity series (more reactive metals) tend to remove oxygen from the oxides of metals that are lower in the reactivity series (less reactive metals). Consider the reaction below; Mg(s) + CuO(s) → Cu(s) + MgO(s). Magnesium is more reactive than copper and therefore removes oxygen from it. Comparing reactivity of metals. 1) Potassium and sodium. When potassium and sodium are freshly cut, they are silvery shiny but their surfaces rapidly tarnish in air because they react quickly with oxygen in the atmosphere to form oxides. Potassium tarnishes more rapidly than sodium, indicating that it is more reactive than sodium. 2) Magnesium. When a piece of magnesium is polished, the shiny silvery surface is exposed. The surface remains shiny for some time before turning grey due to the slow reaction of the magnesium with air forming magnesium oxide (the grey coating). Magnesium is less reactive than sodium and potassium. 3) Aluminium and Zinc. Aluminium and zinc are shiny metals, although their surfaces get coated with thin layers of their respective oxides on exposure to oxygen. Aluminium and zinc react more slowly with oxygen than magnesium forming their oxides. Hence, aluminium and zinc are less reactive than magnesium. 4) Copper. Copper is a brown solid and does not react with oxygen from the atmosphere but reacts with carbondioxide and water from the atmosphere to form a green solid of copper (II) carbonate. Copper is therefore less reactive than aluminium and zinc. From the above reactions, we can establish the reactivity series of metals. Selected reactions of metal oxides. 1) Magnesium and copper (II) oxide. When a mixture of magnesium and copper (II) oxide is heated, a red glow spreads through the mixture leaving a white ash and a brown solid. Magnesium removes oxygen from copper to form magnesium oxide. The white ash is magnesium oxide and the brown solid is copper metal. This shows that magnesium is more reactive than copper. 2) Carbon and copper (II) Oxide. When a mixture of carbon and copper (II) Oxide is heated in a test tube, a brown solid is formed and a colourless gas that turns lime water milky is liberated. Carbon removes Oxygen from copper (II) Oxide to form carbon dioxide. Carbon is therefore, more reactive than copper. 3) Magnesium and Carbon dioxide. Magnesium burns in carbon dioxide to form a mixture of white ash and black solid particles. Magnesium removes oxygen from carbon dioxide to form magnesium oxide. The white ash is magnesium oxide and the black particles are carbon. Magnesium is therefore, more reactive than Carbon. From the above reactions, we can establish the reactivity series that includes carbon. {K [Possiano], Na [Son], C [Come], Mg [Making], Al [A], C [Carbonic], Zn [Z], Fe [In], Sn [The], Pb [Left], H [Hand], Cu [Continue], Hg [My], Ag [Silly], Au [Gold], Pt [Please]}. (This will be covered in detail in Form Two). • In groups, write word equations for the reaction between elements (metals and non-metals) and oxygen when they burn or corrode to form oxides. [Assignment 3] {What is air pollution and how can it affect the atmosphere}. Air pollution. Air pollution is the introduction of substances in the atmosphere that directly or indirectly endanger the lives of living organisms. Air pollutants (substances introduced in the atmosphere that endanger life of living organisms) include: i) Carbondioxide, a contributor to the green-house effect. ii) Carbonmonoxide which is very poisonous reacting with blood and forming a stable compound (carboxyhaemoglobin), thus stopping haemoglobin from carrying oxygen. iii) Oxides of sulphur e.g., Sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide which are toxic. iv) Oxides of nitrogen e.g., nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen oxide, which are contributors to the green-house effect. v) Compounds of heavy metals like lead, mercury and cadmium, which are toxic and poisonous. vi) Radioactive particles which cause abnormalities to plant and animals as a result of mutation. Sources of air pollutants. i) Burning of fossils (coal, coke, oil fuel) produce oxides of carbon and sulphur, hydrogen sulphide and unburnt oil vapour. ii) Industrial and domestic depositions. These produce oxides of carbon, sulphur. They may produce methane and other heavy metals like mercury. iii) The exhaust fumes of locomotives e.g., cars contain carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, unburnt fuel and some heavy metals like lead. iv) Nuclear explosions produce radioactive particles. v) Tobacco smoking that emits harmful chemicals like carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds, degrading air quality indoors and outdoors, leading to respiratory issues and health problems. vi) Natural processes like volcanic eruption that release various pollutants into the atmosphere, including sulphur dioxide, ash, and other gases. vii) Gases released from manure in farm land. Effects of atmospheric pollution. 1) Causes respiratory diseases e.g., cough, lung cancer, etc. 2) Formation of fog which distracts vision and may also be poisonous. 3) Formation of acid rain due to the presence of acidic gases such as sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 4) Darkens buildings especially those painted using lead paints. 5) Causes global warming, particularly carbon dioxide and other green-house gases like methane.
