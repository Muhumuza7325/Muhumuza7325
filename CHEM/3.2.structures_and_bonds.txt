[Assignment 6] {Relate the difference in the physical properties of ionic and covalent compounds to their bonding}. Bonding refers to the formation of chemical connections between atoms, resulting in the creation of compounds or unique metallic structures. These compounds and metallic structures are typically more stable than the individual atoms. Chemical bonds are the attractive forces that hold atoms together. While bonding commonly occurs during chemical reactions, it can also exist in stable molecules without involving a reaction. Electron arrangements in noble gases are very stable. This stability arises from their complete outer electron shells, known as an octet (eight electrons) for most noble gases and a duplet (two electrons) for helium. Due to this stable configuration, noble gases are often referred to as inert gases. Atoms of other elements tend to participate in chemical reactions in order to acquire an electron configuration similar to the noble gases. This drive for stability is known as the octet rule. Elements can achieve this by transferring electrons to form ions or by sharing electrons to form covalent bonds. By losing electrons (becoming cations), gaining electrons (becoming anions), or sharing electrons, atoms can fill their outer shells and reach a more stable state, resembling the electron configuration of a noble gas. Chemical bonding occurs mainly in four forms: 1) Ionic/electrovalent bonding that involves transfer of electrons from a metal atom to a nonmetal atom. 2) Covalent bonding that involves sharing of electrons between two or more nonmetal atoms/elements. 3) Dative/co-ordinate bonding that involves sharing of the bonding electrons which are donated by one molecule or atom involved. 4) Metallic bonding that occurs between atoms of metal elements. 1) The ionic bond (electrovalent bond). An ionic bond is formed between a metal and a nonmetal by the transfer of electrons from the metal atom to the nonmetal atom. This electron transfer stabilizes both atoms by allowing them to achieve an outer electron configuration similar to a full shell. The metal atom loses electrons, gaining a positive charge. The nonmetal atom gains the electrons lost by the metal atom, acquiring a negative charge. This electron transfer process, creating oppositely charged particles, is also known as electrovalent bonding. It is these oppositely charged particles that form the ionic bond. There are two types of ions. (a) Positive ions (cations). A cation is formed when a metal atom loses electrons. (b) Negative ion (anions). An anion is formed as a result of gain electrons by a nonmetal atom. The number of electrons a metal atom transfers to a nonmetal atom in an ionic compound is called its electrovalency. This value reflects the positive charge of the resulting cation. For example, sodium (Na) has an electrovalency of 1 (Na⁺), calcium (Ca) has an electrovalency of 2 (Ca²⁺), and aluminium (Al) has an electrovalency of 3 (Al³⁺). (a) Formation of calcium chloride (Ca = 20, Cl = 17). Figure250.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_001.jpg. (b) Formation of magnesium chloride. Figure251.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_002.jpg. (c) Formation of sodium chloride (Na = 12, Cl = 17). Figure252.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_003.jpg. (d) Formation of calcium oxide (Ca = 20, O = 8). (e) Formation of magnesium oxide. Figure253.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_004.jpg. (f) Formation of lithium oxide? Characteristic properties of ionic compounds. Crystalline and Non-volatile: Ionic compounds exist as crystalline solids at room temperature due to the strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions (cations and anions) arranged in a highly ordered lattice structure. This strong ionic bonding also makes them non-volatile, meaning they resist vaporization at room temperature. High Melting and Boiling Points: The significant energy required to overcome the powerful electrostatic forces between ions translates to high melting and boiling points for ionic compounds. Conductive in Solutions/Melts, Not in Solid State: In molten or dissolved states, the ions become mobile and can carry a charge, enabling the solution or melt to conduct electricity. However, in their solid state, the ions are fixed within the crystal lattice and lack mobility, preventing electrical conductivity. Giant Ionic Structures and High Density: Unlike molecules in covalent compounds, ionic compounds form giant three-dimensional structures where cations and anions alternate in a continuous lattice. This tight packing of ions contributes to their high density. Solubility: Ionic compounds exhibit varying degrees of solubility depending on the solvent. Polar solvents, like water, have a positive and negative end due to uneven charge distribution. These charged ends can interact favourably with the oppositely charged ions in the ionic compound, causing them to separate from the crystal lattice and dissolve. Non-polar organic solvents, such as benzene or carbon tetrachloride, lack the ability to effectively interact with ionic charges. This often results into insolubility of ionic compounds in these solvents. The strength of the ionic bond, also known as lattice energy, can influence solubility. Compounds with a very strong lattice (i.e., requiring a high amount of energy to break) might be less soluble because the solvent needs to overcome this strong attraction between ions. While non-polar covalent bonds involve symmetrical sharing of electrons, polar covalent compounds arise from unequal sharing due to differences in electronegativity, the tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond. This unequal sharing is influenced by both electronegativity and, to a lesser extent, Electropositivity (the tendency of an atom to lose or share electrons readily). The more electronegative atom, like oxygen in water, attracts the shared electrons more strongly, resulting in a partial negative charge on itself and partial positive charges on the bonded atoms (like the hydrogens in water). Figure254.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_005.jpg. This uneven distribution of electrons due to electronegativity differences, makes the molecule polar. It's important to note that elements with high electropositivity often form ionic compounds with complete electron transfer, not the unequal sharing seen in polar covalent bonds. 2) The covalent bond. Covalent bonds form when nonmetal atoms (or hydrogen) share electron pairs to achieve a stable outer shell configuration, often resembling an octet for many elements. This mutual sharing creates a molecule, the basic unit of a covalent compound. Covalent substances can exist as simple molecules or as large and complex polymers. A single covalent bond is represented by a dash (-), like Cl-Cl for the chlorine molecule (Cl₂). Covalency refers to the number of electron pairs an atom can share in bonds. Covalent bonds can be single, double, triple, or even quadruple, depending on the number of electron pairs shared. Figure255.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_006.jpg. While not the strongest type of bond, covalent bonds can be quite stable. a) Single covalent bond: This is formed when a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms, typically nonmetal atoms (or hydrogen), to achieve a stable outer shell configuration. Each atom involved contributes one electron to the shared pair. (i) Formation of Hydrogen molecule (H = 1). Figure256.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_007.jpg. (iii) Water molecule (H₂O). Figure257.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_008.jpg. (iv) Ammonia molecule (NH₃). Figure258.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_009.jpg. Note: An atom can have more electrons in its valence shell than those involved in covalent bonding; These non-bonding electron pairs, also known as lone/non-bonded pairs, can influence the shape and reactivity of the molecule. Lone pairs are not limited to covalent bonding and can influence molecular properties in Lewis acid-base interactions and electron-deficient molecules. (iv) Methane molecule (CH₄). Figure259.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_010.jpg. (b) Double covalent bond. This is formed when two pairs of electrons are shared between two bonded atoms, allowing them to achieve a more stable outer shell configuration. A double covalent bond is typically represented by a double dash (=) between the atoms. Example (i) Oxygen (O₂). Figure260.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_011.jpg. (ii) Formation of carbon dioxide. Figure261.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_012.jpg. Exercise. Formation of chlorine molecule (Cl = 17). c) Triple covalent bond. This is formed when three pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms, allowing them to achieve a stronger and more stable outer shell configuration compared to single or double bonds. A triple covalent bond is typically represented by a triple dash (≡) between the atoms. (i) Nitrogen molecule (N₂). Figure262.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_013.jpg. (ii) Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN). Figure263.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_014.jpg. d) Quadruple covalent bond. This is a rare type of covalent bond formed when four pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. This sharing allows them to achieve a very stable outer shell configuration. Quadruple bonds are most commonly found between transition metals, but can theoretically occur between other elements under specific circumstances. Note that this is still an ongoing area of research. Characteristic properties of covalent compounds. Electrical Conductivity: Covalent compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity in both solid and liquid states. This is because they lack free-moving ions or delocalized electrons, which are essential for electrical current to flow. Solubility: Covalent compounds typically have low solubility in water. Water, a polar molecule, interacts poorly with the relatively nonpolar covalent molecules. However, some small polar covalent molecules, like methanol, can form hydrogen bonds with water and achieve some degree of solubility. Conversely, covalent compounds often dissolve well in organic solvents like benzene or chloroform, which have similar polarities and can interact through weak intermolecular forces. Melting and Boiling Points: Covalent compounds generally have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds. This is due to the weaker nature of covalent bonds compared to ionic bonds. Less energy is needed to overcome the attractive forces between molecules in a covalent compound, allowing them to transition to liquid or gas phases at lower temperatures. Giant covalent structures like diamond are an exception due to their extensive network of covalent bonds, requiring significantly more energy to break. Physical States: Due to the weak intermolecular forces between covalent molecules, these compounds can exist in various physical states at room temperature. Many are gases (e.g., oxygen, O₂) or volatile liquids (e.g., ethanol, C₂H₅OH) that evaporate readily. Some can form soft solids (e.g., wax) due to the weak packing of their molecules. Molecular Structure and Forces: Covalent compounds consist of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces like Van der Waals forces. These forces arise from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution within each molecule and influence the physical states and some properties of covalent substances. 3) The metallic bond. Metallic bonding occurs between metal atoms, which can be of the same kind (pure metals) or different types (alloys). These atoms are arranged in a highly ordered crystal lattice structure. Metal atoms readily lose some of their valence electrons, transforming into positively charged metal cations. These cations remain fixed within the lattice, attracted to a delocalized "sea" of electrons that move freely throughout the metal. The mutual attraction between the positively charged cations and the surrounding electron sea gives rise to the metallic bond. Generally, metals that lose more electrons tend to form stronger metallic bonds (e.g., aluminium with 3 versus sodium with 1 electron lost). This difference in bond strength is reflected in the physical properties of metals. Stronger metallic bonds result in harder metals with high resistance to shattering (like iron and aluminium), while weaker bonds lead to softer, more easily cut metals (like potassium and sodium). Additionally, the delocalized electron sea is responsible for the excellent electrical and thermal conductivity that is a hallmark of metals. Figure265.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_016.jpg. Properties of metals. Metals are typically strong, lustrous solids at room temperature (except mercury), thanks to the robust metallic bond. This bond's strength also leads to high melting and boiling points. The delocalized electrons responsible for the bond allow metals to excel in conducting electricity and heat. Additionally, the ability of metal atoms to slide past each other under stress (e.g., when compressed) grants them the unique properties of ductility (being drawn into wires) and malleability (being hammered into sheets). These remarkable properties make metals invaluable for various applications. 4) The coordinate or dative bond. A coordinate/dative bond is a special type of covalent bond where the shared electron pair comes entirely from one atom or molecule (donor). The donor typically has a lone pair (unshared electron pair) in its outer shell, while the acceptor atom or molecule has an empty orbital to accommodate the shared electrons. The bond is often represented by an arrow pointing from the donor to the acceptor, indicating the direction of electron donation. Molecules like ammonia (NH₃) and water (H₂O) possess lone pairs and can act as electron donors in coordinate bonds. (i) Formation of Ammonium ion. During the formation of an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), ammonia (NH₃) reacts with an acid. The nitrogen atom in ammonia has a lone pair of electrons, which it donates to a proton (H⁺) from the acid. This donation allows the nitrogen atom to achieve a stable octet configuration. The positive charge from the donated proton remains primarily localized on the more electronegative nitrogen atom, resulting in the positively charged ammonium ion. Figure266.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_017.jpg. A water molecule combines with a hydrogen ion in a similar way to form the oxonium ion, H₃O⁺ (Put the illustration in your book and hand it in for marking). Note that while POCl₃ formation might involve some aspects of electron donation (potentially a coordinate character), it's not a straightforward coordinate covalent bond. The P-O bond is better described as a double bond with some ionic character. Exercise. 1) Draw diagrams to show the arrangement of electrons in the following compounds. a) KCl. b) Na₂O. c) MgCl₂. d) CS₂. 2) Draw diagrams to show the arrangement of electrons in the energy levels of atoms in the following molecules. Use only the outer most electrons to illustrate. a) Ethane (C₂H₄). b) Ethyne (C₂H₂). Structures of compounds/substances. The different types of chemical bonds influence how atoms and ions arrange themselves, leading to various structures in solid substances. These structures are typically three-dimensional with well-defined shapes. The building blocks for these structures can be atoms, ions, or molecules. Crystalline solids exhibit a highly ordered, repeating arrangement of these building blocks, whereas amorphous solids lack a regular structure. It's important to note that some liquids and even gases can exhibit ordered structures at the molecular level. Crystalline solids too can have some minor imperfections in their structure, but they generally maintain a high degree of order. The crystalline solids have two broad structures. 1) Simple molecular structures. Simple molecular structures are a type of crystalline solid formed mainly by covalent compounds. These structures consist of independent molecules containing a few atoms held together by strong covalent bonds. The individual molecules are then attracted to each other by weak intermolecular forces like Van der Waals forces. These forces are relatively weak and can be easily overcome, resulting in relatively low melting and boiling points for these solids. Generally, as the size and surface area of the molecules increase, the strength of Van der Waals forces can also increase. Examples of substances that can form simple molecular crystals include iodine, solid carbon dioxide/dry ice, and water. Figure268.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_019.jpg. Figure269.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_020.jpg. Properties of simple molecules. They have low melting and boiling points. They do not conduct electricity in either molten or solution forms. They're generally insoluble in water (polar) but soluble in organic solvents (often nonpolar) due to similar intermolecular interactions. Most of them are typically gases or liquids at room temperature. Very few are solids. They have low densities as the molecules are not closely packed. 2) Giant structures. (i) Giant ionic structures. Giant ionic structures are solids consisting of cations and anions arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. Strong ionic bonds, formed due to the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, hold these structures together. Examples include NaCl, MgCl₂, and Al₂O₃. In sodium chloride, each sodium ion is surrounded by six chloride ions, and vice versa, in an octahedral arrangement. This arrangement defines the coordination number, which is the number of ions surrounding an ion of opposite charge. The co-ordination number of NaCl is therefore, 6:6. Figure270.3.2.structures_and_bonds_image_021.jpg. Properties of ionic crystals. Ionic crystals are characterized by their impressive strength and distinct electrical properties. The strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions leads to a rigid structure, making them hard, but also brittle due to their limited ability to shift under stress. This strong ionic bonding also translates to high melting and boiling points. While most ionic crystals are insoluble in organic solvents due to a mismatch in polarity, they readily dissolve in water. The polar water molecules surround and solvate the dissociated ions (separate them into charged particles), making them soluble. In their molten state or in aqueous solutions, these mobile ions conduct electricity efficiently. (ii) Giant covalent/molecular/atomic structures. Giant covalent structures boast impressive hardness and distinct properties due to their extensive networks of covalent bonds. Take diamond, for instance, where each carbon atom forms strong covalent bonds with four neighbours in a tetrahedral arrangement, creating a rigid three-dimensional framework. This structure makes diamond incredibly hard but brittle. In contrast, graphite, another form of carbon, features layers of six-membered carbon rings. These layers are connected by weaker forces, allowing the layers to slide, giving graphite its lubricating properties. While most giant covalent structures are electrical insulators, graphite's delocalized electrons grant it some conductivity. Silicon dioxide (SiO₂), commonly known as quartz, forms a network of silicon and oxygen atoms with a tetrahedral arrangement around each silicon. This structure contributes to its high melting point and makes it a common component of glass and sand. Therefore, giant covalent structures' extensive covalent bonding network grants them exceptional strength, high melting points, and general insolubility, with graphite being a unique conductor due to delocalized electrons. (iii) Giant metallic structures. Giant metallic structures are formed by metal atoms. These metals have delocalized electrons that hold the positively charged metal ions together through electrostatic attraction. The metal atoms are arranged in a close-packed structure, with the specific packing depending on the metal. Most giant metallic structures are hard solids at room temperature, with mercury being a liquid exception. They have high melting and boiling points due to the strong metallic bonds. The delocalized electrons allow the metal ions to slide past each other, making them malleable (can be hammered into shapes) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). The interaction of these electrons with light gives freshly cut metals a shiny appearance. Finally, their delocalized electrons allow them to be good conductors of electricity.
