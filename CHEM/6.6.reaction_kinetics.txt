TOPIC 13 ***Reaction Kinetics*** "36 PERIODS". Competency; The learner evaluates factors influencing reaction rates, and applies the principles of reaction, mechanisms and rate laws to predict the speed of chemical reactions under various conditions. SUB-TOPIC 13.1 ***Rate Equations and Orders of Reaction*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) deduce rate equations from experimental data, determine the order of reactions, and explain the significance of rate constants (u, s, v/a). b) Individually, search for information about key concepts in reaction kinetics such as rate of reaction, rate law, molecularity of reaction, and mechanisms of reaction, discuss in your groups and make reports. c) engage in a teacher-guided discussion and use the kinetic data provided to determine the order of reaction, rate constant and half-life. d) engage in guided discussions to analyse and interpret graphical data and use it to determine the order of reaction (first- and zero-order reactions), rate constant and half-life (Derivations of integrated forms of orders of reaction are not required). e) In pairs, design experiments to determine orders of reaction (iodination of propanone and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide) and make reports. SUB-TOPIC 13.2 ***Factors Affecting Rates of Reactions*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) evaluate how temperature, concentration, surface area, and catalysts affect reaction rates by applying collision theory to support conclusions (u, s, v/a); b) evaluate the influence of factors affecting reaction rates in industrial contexts, critically analysing how optimising reaction rates benefits production processes (u, s, v/a). a) In groups, use prior knowledge to discuss the effect of different factors on reaction rates, linking them to the collision theory, and then write reports. b) In pairs, experimentally determine the activation energy of a redox reaction between ethanedioate ions and manganate (VII) ions in the acidic medium, and make reports. a) In groups, analyse industrial case studies where reaction rate optimisation is crucial and role-play as industry chemists, presenting solutions;
