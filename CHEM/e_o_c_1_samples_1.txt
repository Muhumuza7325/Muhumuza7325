Item 4 [UNEB Sample]: Air which is a mixture of different components contains 21% oxygen. Due to a wide spread of respiratory illnesses caused by COVID-19, there was an increased demand for oxygen by patients in hospitals. The government supply of oxygen is not enough and is planning to set up an oxygen production plant with minimal environmental impact. However, the science club members in your school would like to know how the process of production will be carried out. Task: As chemistry student, make a write up you will use during the presentation.#Raw material (Liquid air / Air) (02 scores).#Production process.#Air is passed through air filters to remove dust and smoke particles. Air is passed through concentrated sodium hydroxide solution to absorb / remove carbon dioxide, which is acidic.#2NaOH(aq) + CO₂(g) → Na₂CO₃(aq) + H₂O(l).#Air free from Carbon dioxide is now passed through Silicon (IV) oxide / silica gel to absorb water vapour. Carbon dioxide and water vapour are removed from air before it is liquefied because they solidify and block the apparatus.#The air is now compressed at 200 atmospheres and allowed to cool by making it escape into a large space through a jet.#The process of cooling is repeated several times to obtain liquid air at about -200⁰C.#The liquid air is fractionally distilled using a fractionating column / tower.#Nitrogen boils off first because it has a lower boiling point (–196⁰C) leaving behind oxygen with a higher boiling point (-183⁰C).#Both nitrogen and oxygen obtained contain traces of noble gases. Pure oxygen is then stored under pressure in steel cylinders. (03 scores).#Side effects of the process of production and mitigation.#a) Explosion of oxygen cylinders due to high pressure. This can cause other materials to ignite spontaneously/catch fire. The resulting fire can cause damage to equipment and injury to people.#Mitigation can be done by:#- Regular maintenance and monitoring of cylinders.#- Keeping cylinders in cool areas / avoid exposure to heat.#b) Exposure to liquid oxygen can cause severe skin and eye irritations and burns.#This may cause loss of vision and cancer.#Mitigation can be done by:#- Posting hazard and warning information in the working area.#- Communicating all information on the health and safety hazards of oxygen to potentially exposed workers; for example; submerging the affected body parts in warm water.#c) Air pollution by waste gases. Acidic gases can cause acid rain which leads to crumbling of buildings, lowering of soil pH and corrosion of roofs made of iron.#Mitigation can be done by:#- Fitting catalytic converters in exhaust pipes of machines to convert oxides of nitrogen into nitrogen and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.#- Neutralise the acidic gases before releasing waste gases into the atmosphere. (03 scores).#Social benefits.#- Employment opportunity; improved income thus better standards of living.#- Development of infrastructure e.g. electricity lines, roads, hospitals, schools etc., improved road network will facilitate trade hence improved income and better standards of living.
