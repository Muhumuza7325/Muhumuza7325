TOPIC 12 ***Organic Chemistry III*** "36 PERIODS". Competency; The learner analyses the chemical properties, industrial applications, and environmental impacts of amines and polymers, evaluates their social and ecological implications, and proposes innovations and sustainable solutions for addressing challenges in their use and disposal. SUB-TOPIC 12.1 ***Amines*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) analyse the structure, nomenclature, preparation and properties of amines in relation to their functional group (k, u, s); b) evaluate the industrial and biological significance of amines, and assess their roles in real life (u, s, v/a). a) Individually, search for information about the structure, nomenclature, physical properties and reactions of amines, discuss your findings in groups and make reports. b) work in groups to construct molecular models to demonstrate primary, secondary, and tertiary amine structures. c) In pairs, apply problem-based learning to perform exercises and fill worksheets on the nomenclature and properties of amines. d) work in pairs to carry out test tube experiments involving the reactions of amines. a) In groups, examine case studies involving examples of amines in pharmaceuticals and dyes and discuss their functions. b) In groups, carry out projects involving the use of amines in daily life. SUB-TOPIC 12.2 ***Polymers and Polymerisation*** "18 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) synthesise information on the types of polymerisation (addition and condensation), including the mechanisms involved in forming polymers from monomers, and distinguish between natural and synthetic polymers based on their structures and properties (u, s); b) evaluate the environmental impact of polymers with emphasis on artificial polymers, proposing sustainable alternatives and analysing recycling techniques (u, s, v/a). a) As a class, watch a video about the process of addition and condensation, as well as polymerisation, and use the information to hold group discussions and perform related tasks. b) In groups, use the inquiry-based approach to compare the properties of different polymers created through each type of polymerisation. c) In pairs, perform exercises involving the formation, classification and properties of polymers. a) As a class, engage in a debate on the pros and cons of synthetic polymers. b) In groups, carry out projects on polymers and sustainable alternatives to synthetic polymers;
