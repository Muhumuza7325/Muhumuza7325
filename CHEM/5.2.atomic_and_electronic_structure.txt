TOPIC 2 ***Atomic and Electronic Structure*** "27 PERIODS". Competency; The learner deduces electronic configurations, evaluates their implications for chemical properties and bonding, and synthesises models to predict atomic behaviour in various contexts. SUB-TOPIC 2.1 ***Electron Configurations of Atoms and Ions*** "12 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to apply the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hundâ€™s rule to write electronic configurations of atoms and ions and use them to predict reactivity (u, s). a) Individually, use the Internet, demonstration videos, or suitable textbooks to search for information on principles of writing electronic configurations, discuss your findings in groups, and write electronic configurations of atoms and ions. b) In groups, use visual aids such as energy level diagrams to illustrate principles of writing electronic configurations. c) In pairs, use a problem-based approach to carry out exercises involving writing configurations of selected atoms and ions and predicting reactivity. SUB-TOPIC 2.2 ***Radioactivity and Its Applications*** "15 PERIODS". Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) examine the nature and types of radioactive decay and apply this knowledge to predict decay rates and half-lives in specific elements (k, u, s); b) evaluate the principles of radioactivity in real-life applications, such as in medicine, industry, and environmental science and the associated health, environmental, and ethical implications of radioactive materials (u, v/a). a) In groups, search for information about radioactive decay, nuclear stability, decay rates, and half-life, discuss your findings, and carry out related calculations. b) In groups, use a problem-based approach to solve mathematical problems on radioactive decay and half-life. a) Individually, search for information about applications and effects of radioactivity, discuss your findings in groups and make presentations. b) In groups, analyse case studies on applications of radioactivity in real life. c) engage in a class debate to evaluate the ethical and related safety implications of radioactivity;
