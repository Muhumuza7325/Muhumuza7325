Competency; The learner appreciates the diversity of properties of elements and how these properties change across the periods and groups of the Periodic table. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Know the trends in physical properties of the elements across the periods in the Periodic table (k); b) Know the trends in typical, physical, and chemical properties of simple compounds of the elements of the third period (u, s); c) Predict physical and chemical properties of different elements in Group I (u, s). To start, please note that in this very chapter, we shall be building on what we learnt from most of our previous chapters. To accomplish some of the suggested learning activities, you will need prior knowledge of the chapters of air (chapter 3.1), water (chapter 3.2), acids and alkalis (chapter 5.1), the periodic table (chapter 6), the reactivity series (chapter 8) and structures and bonds (chapter 10). [Assignment 1] {Detail the trends in physical properties of the elements across the periods in the Periodic table}. Trends in physical properties across periods. Physical properties are observable or measurable characteristics used to identify and describe matter without causing a chemical change. They can be categorised as intensive (independent of amount) like density, colour, melting point, and boiling point, or extensive (dependent on amount) like mass, volume, and length. They also encompass sensory properties detectable by our senses like colour, odour, and texture, and behaviour-related properties describing how matter interacts under certain conditions, such as melting point, boiling point, density, solubility, electrical conductivity, and polarity. Trends in density. The density of an element is primarly influenced by its atomic mass and atomic radius. Atoms of elements in the same period usually have the same number of energy levels. However, the number of neutrons, protons and electrons increases among atoms across a given period, from left to right. Thus, atomic mass increases across a period, from left to right. Note that the electrons are being added to the already existing energy levels, and the increasing nuclear charge pulls them closer, leading to a decrease in atomic radius. Thus, atomic radius (size) decreases across a period, from left to right. This interplay often results in increasing density from left to right in the period due to tighter packing of atoms. However, the trend may level off or even decrease towards the end. This can be caused by: Inter-electron repulsion: Repulsion between electrons in the outer shells can counteract the shrinking effect, especially for later elements. Crystal structure: Some elements adopt crystal structures that pack less efficiently, affecting overall density. Therefore, while the general trend is for density to increase across a period, variations in electron repulsion and crystal structure can influence the specific behaviour for some elements. Trends in melting and boiling points. Across a period in the periodic table, melting and boiling points generally increase from Group I to Group IV due to strengthening metallic bonds. More electrons contribute to the delocalised "sea of electrons" that attracts metal cations, requiring more energy to overcome. However, this trend reverses after Group IV as elements shift towards covalent bonding or weaker metallic interactions. For nonmetals, van der Waals forces become dominant. While weaker than metallic bonds, these forces increase in strength as atoms get larger and have more electrons, especially for heavier elements within a group. This explains the overall rise in melting and boiling points across a period for nonmetals, with heavier elements having a stronger tendency to form temporary attractions and requiring more energy to transition phases. It's important to remember that this trend might not be perfectly linear due to variations in atomic structure and electron configurations. Trends in electrical conductivity. Across a period in the periodic table, electrical conductivity generally increases from Group I to Group IV due to the presence of readily available delocalised electrons in metals. These electrons can move freely throughout the metallic lattice, readily carrying current. However, this trend reverses after Group IV. Elements shift towards covalent bonding or weaker metallic interactions with fewer delocalised electrons. For nonmetals, electrical conductivity becomes very low as electrons are tightly bound within molecules or atoms. While some nonmetals can exhibit weak conductivity under specific conditions, they generally lack the mobile electrons necessary for efficient current flow. It's important to remember that this trend might not be perfectly linear due to variations in atomic structure and electron configurations. Some nonmetals can exhibit surprising conductivity due to factors like mobile ions or band gaps. Trends in physical properties of elements across period 3. Electronegativity and Ionization Energy: Across Period 3, both electronegativity and ionization energy generally increase from sodium to argon. This reflects a tightening grip on electrons as you move across the period. The increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer, making them harder to share (increasing electronegativity) and requiring more energy to remove (increasing ionization energy). There might be a small dip in ionization energy between magnesium and aluminium due to differences in electron subshells, but the overall trend is one of increasing difficulty in removing electrons. Density: Across Period 3, density generally increases from sodium to aluminium due to rising atomic mass and decreasing atomic radius in metals, leading to tighter packing. This trend changes from silicon onwards. Silicon's giant covalent structure, while massive, doesn't pack as densely as metals. Nonmetals like phosphorus and sulphur have lower densities due to weaker bonding and larger molecules. Finally, argon, a monatomic gas, has the lowest density due to weak interatomic forces. Melting and boiling points. Metals (Na, Mg, Al) have high melting and boiling points due to strong metallic bonding. Aluminium, with its stronger metallic bonds, has a higher melting point than sodium and magnesium. Silicon, a metalloid, has a very high melting point due to its giant covalent structure with strong covalent bonds that require high energy to break for boiling or melting to take place. Nonmetals (P, S, Cl, Ar) exhibit lower melting and boiling points. Phosphorus and sulphur form simple molecular structures with weak van der Waals forces of attraction between the molecules, resulting in relatively low melting and boiling points because their bonds require little energy to break for boiling or melting to take place, though sulphur has higher melting and boiling points than phosphorus due to larger molecular size (S₈ versus P₄). Chlorine is a diatomic gas (Cl₂) with low melting and boiling points, and argon is a noble gas with extremely low melting and boiling points. The weak van der Waals forces in chlorine and argon require less energy to overcome compared to the stronger covalent bonds within the phosphorus and sulphur molecules, leading to their lower melting and boiling points. Electrical conductivity. Metals (Na, Mg, Al) are good conductors of electricity due to the presence of free-moving electrons. Silicon, a metalloid, has moderate electrical conductivity, which can be enhanced by doping. Nonmetals (P, S, Cl, Ar) are poor conductors of electricity. Video73.Trends_in_the_Periodic_Table.mp4. • In groups, revisit prior learning about the Periodic table and identify patterns in the arrangement of elements in groups and across periods in terms of: • proton number, • electron arrangement and • properties. [Assignment 2] {Predict physical and chemical properties of different elements in Group I}. The elements in the periodic table are classified as Metals, Metalloids, Nonmetals and Noble gases/Rare gases/Inert gases (For more details, refer to chapter 6, the periodic table). Chemical families. Chemical families are groups of elements with similar chemical properties due to the close resemblance in their valence electron configurations i.e., elements in the same group of the periodic table with the same number of electrons in the outer most energy level or shell. This similarity leads to predictable behaviour in terms of gaining or losing electrons during chemical reactions. However, the influence of inner electrons can also play a role in some cases. Down the group of metals, reactivity increases. This is because of increase in atomic size (atomic radius). As the size of atoms increase, the outer most electrons become loosely held because they are no longer strongly attracted by the nucleus, hence, such electrons are easily lost. Because metals react by loss of electrons, the more easily a metal loses electrons, the more reactive that metal is. Unlike metals, the reactivity of nonmetals down a group isn't a simple story of increasing atomic size. While larger atoms may experience a weaker pull on electrons due to shielding, this isn't the dominant factor. Instead, the interplay of effective nuclear charge (accounting for shielding), electron configuration, and available orbitals, determines how readily nonmetals gain electrons to form anions. This complex interplay can lead to a slight decrease, little change, or variations in reactivity down a group for nonmetals. Reactivity across a period reflects a balance between the increasing attraction of the nucleus for electrons and the ease of losing or gaining electrons for the elements. This leads to the observed trend of decreasing reactivity for metals (Group I to IV), then a rise for nonmetals (Group V to VII) wanting to fill their outer shell, and finally a sharp drop for the stable noble gases. The common chemical families are: Alkali/alkaline metals; alkaline earth metals; halogens and noble gases. The alkali metals (Group I). Group I contains six elements placed in a vertical column on the far left of the periodic table. Keeping focus on the first 20 elements in the periodic table, only lithium, sodium and potassium will be explored. Atoms of group I elements have one electron in the outer most shell which is easily lost during chemical reactions leaving a single positively charged ion. Li (2:1), Na (2:8:1), K (2:8:8:1). They are therefore monovalent (they tend to form compounds with a +1 charge). These metals are very reactive and are kept under oil in the laboratory where they have no contact with water and air. They are called alkali metals because they react with water to form alkaline solutions. Physical properties of Alkali metals. Alkali metals boast low melting and boiling points due to their weak metallic bonding. With just one electron per atom contributing to the "sea of electrons," the attraction between nuclei and delocalised electrons is weak. This, combined with the increasing size of ions down the group (requiring less energy to overcome the weak bond), leads to a decrease in both melting and boiling points. The trend goes hand-in-hand with hardness, where lithium, the smallest with the strongest bond, is also the hardest, while larger alkali metals become progressively softer due to the weaker metallic bonding. Alkali metals are shiny due to their weak metallic bonding. However, their reactivity with oxygen leads to tarnishing as they quickly form a layer of oxide, diminishing the initial shine. The presence of a "sea of mobile electrons" arising from their weak metallic bonding, allows alkali metals to conduct electricity and heat effectively. Alkali metals (Li, Na, K) boast an unexpected property: Their low density allows them to float on water. This arises from a balancing act between two trends. As you move down the group, atomic radius increases, creating larger volumes and a tendency for lower density. However, atomic mass also rises due to more protons and neutrons, which counteracts the volume increase. For Li, Na, and K, the bigger atomic radius wins, resulting in a net decrease in density and their buoyancy in water. Precise density calculations consider all these factors (mass, radius, crystal structure) and require mathematical tools. Alkali metals are also the most reactive metals and the most willing to lose electrons (most electropositive). This stems from their weak metallic bonding due to a single valence electron per atom. This weak bond translates to low tensile strength, making them easily pulled apart, and high reactivity as they readily lose that electron to form ionic bonds. Reactions of alkali metals with air, water and chlorine. Alkali metals (Li, Na, K) are all very reactive, primarily due to their single valence electron, which they readily lose to form positive ions. This electron's ease of removal makes them highly reactive and prone to forming ionic bonds. Reactivity increases down the group from lithium to potassium. This trend is due to the increasing atomic radius and decreasing ionization energy as you move down the group. The outer electron is farther from the nucleus and more shielded by inner electron shells, making it easier to remove. While lithium, sodium, and potassium are all very reactive due to their similar electron configurations, the increasing reactivity down the group is a significant trend observed in their chemical behaviour. Differences in reactions might also be influenced by factors such as atomic size, lattice energies, and solvation effects. 1) Reaction with air. When alkali metals are heated in oxygen, they burn readily forming their respective metal oxides. Potassium burns with a bright purple flame producing white solids of potassium oxide. 4K(s) + O₂(g) → 2K₂O(s). Sodium burns in plenty of air with a bright yellow flame, forming yellow solids of sodium peroxide. In limited in air, sodium burns with a yellow flame to form a white solid, sodium oxide. 4Na(s) + 2O₂(g) → 2Na₂O₂(s) (In excess air). 4Na(s) + O₂(g) → 2Na₂O(s) (In limited air). Lithium burns in oxygen with a crimson flame (intensive white) to form a white solid, lithium oxide. 4Li(s) + O₂(g) → 2Li₂O(s). 2) Reaction with water. All the alkali metals react with cold water to produce hydrogen gas and their respective metal hydroxides (alkaline solutions). Potassium reacts very vigorously, darts on water and burns with a bright purple (lilac) flame, producing fumes of hydrogen gas and an alkaline solution of potassium hydroxide. 2K(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H₂(g). Sodium melts into a silvery ball, darts on water, reacting vigorously with water, producing fumes of hydrogen gas with a hissing sound and an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide. The sodium reduces in size as the reaction proceeds until when it finally disappears. 2Na(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g). Lithium floats on the water surface, gradually dissolving, producing hydrogen gas. An alkaline solution is formed. 2Li(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2LiOH(aq) + H₂(g). It's important to note that these reactions can be quite dangerous due to the flammable hydrogen gas that is evolved. 3) Reaction with chlorine. The alkaline metals react with chlorine to form metal chloride salts. E.g., Potassium burns in chlorine with a bright violet flame, forming white potassium chloride fumes. 2K(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2KCl(s). Sodium continues to burn in chlorine with a bright yellow flame to form white fumes of sodium chloride. 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s). Lithium burns in chlorine with a crimson or reddish-orange flame, forming white lithium chloride fumes. 2Li(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2LiCl(s). 4) Reaction with acids. Alkaline metals react explosively with acids to liberate hydrogen gas and forming a corresponding salt. E.g., sodium reacts with hydrochloric acid to form sodium chloride and hydrogen gas. 2Na(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H₂(g). Potassium reacts with sulphuric acid to form potassium sulphate and hydrogen gas. 2K(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → K₂SO₄(aq) + H₂(g). These reactions too, can be quite dangerous due to the flammable hydrogen gas that is evolved. Uses of alkali metals. Alkali metals find extensive applications across diverse fields owing to their unique properties. Sodium compounds, notably sodium chloride, serve as essential components in food preservation and seasoning due to their ability to enhance flavour and inhibit microbial growth. Additionally, sodium hydroxide plays a pivotal role in industrial processes, including soap and detergent manufacturing, due to its strong alkaline nature, which facilitates saponification reactions. Potassium, in the form of potassium nitrate and potassium chloride, is vital for enhancing crop yield through fertilisers, as potassium is a crucial nutrient for plant growth and development. Potassium hydroxide finds utility in soap production and certain glass formulations due to its strong alkalinity and ability to react with fatty acids and silicates, respectively. Potassium permanganate serves as a potent oxidising agent crucial for water treatment and medical applications, where its ability to disinfect and oxidise organic compounds is invaluable. Lithium, prized for its use in lithium-ion batteries, powers portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems, revolutionising modern technology with its high energy density, light weight, and long lifespan. Additionally, lithium compounds contribute to ceramics, glass manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals, where their unique properties enhance material properties or serve as active ingredients in medications. Lithium grease serves as a durable lubricant in automotive and industrial settings due to its ability to withstand high temperatures and extreme conditions. Rubidium and caesium, although less common, play crucial roles in precision timekeeping, serving as the cornerstone of atomic clocks and synchronisation systems due to their remarkable stability and accuracy, which stem from the predictable behaviour of their electronic transitions. These applications underscore the indispensable role of alkali metals in driving innovation and progress across various industries and technologies.

The alkaline earth metals (Group II elements). The alkaline earth metals, comprising Group II elements in the periodic table, share a common feature of having two electrons in their outermost shell, rendering them divalent (they tend to form compounds with a +2 charge). Beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca), for instance, exhibit electron configurations of 2:2, 2:8:2, and 2:8:8:2, respectively. The term "alkaline earth metals" originates from the fact that their oxides, commonly found in Earth's minerals, dissolve in water to form alkaline (basic) solutions. Descending down the group, the size of the atoms increases due to the addition of more energy levels. Physically, Group II metals possess higher melting and boiling points compared to Group I metals, attributed to their stronger metallic bonds resulting from the release of more electrons into the electron cloud. This phenomenon also contributes to their hardness, relative to Group I metals. Furthermore, their high densities stem from the compact arrangement of atoms, facilitated by their relatively small size. These metals are excellent conductors of heat and electricity owing to the presence of mobile electrons. When pure and clean, they typically exhibit a silver-gray colouration. Chemical reactions of alkaline earth metals. Alkaline earth metals are generally less reactive than alkali metals due to the stronger hold of their valence electrons, resulting from increased effective nuclear charge. This makes them less prone to release electrons easily. However, reactivity increases down the group as atomic size increases. Calcium is the most reactive among the alkaline earth metals, followed by magnesium and beryllium. 1) Reaction with air. These metals burn in air with their characteristic flames forming their respective metal oxides. Magnesium burns in air with a brilliant white flame, forming white ash of magnesium oxide. 2Mg(s) + O₂(g) → 2MgO(s). Calcium burns in air with a bright orange/red flame, forming white ash of calcium oxide. Ca(s) + O₂(g) → 2CaO(s). Both metals also form some nitrides especially if the supply of oxygen is limited. In limited oxygen, magnesium reacts with nitrogen of air to form a white powder of magnesium nitride. 3Mg(s) + N₂(g) → Mg₃N₂(s) (Magnesium nitride). 3Ca(s) + N₂(g) → Ca₃N₂(s) (Calcium nitride). Interestingly, when the nitrides are dissolved in water and the solution warmed, ammonia gas is liberated and an alkaline solution is formed. Mg₃N₂(s) + 6H₂O(l) → 3Mg(OH)₂(aq) + 2NH₃(g). Ca₃N₂(s) + 6H₂O(l) → 3Ca(OH)₂(aq) + 2NH₃(g). 2) Reaction with water. Beryllium does not react with water. Magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water, producing very few bubbles of hydrogen gas on the surface of the metal and an alkaline solution of magnesium hydroxide. Mg(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g). However, hot magnesium reacts rapidly with steam, burning with a bright white flame, producing hydrogen gas and white ash of magnesium oxide. 2Mg(s) + 2H₂O(g) → 2MgO(s) + 2H₂(g). Calcium sinks to the bottom as it’s denser than water. Effervescence occurs and hydrogen gas is given off. A cloudy solution of calcium hydroxide is formed. Ca(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Ca(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g). 3) Reaction with chlorine. These metals burn readily in chlorine to form white anhydrous chloride salts. E.g., magnesium burns brightly in chlorine to form a white solid of magnesium chloride. Mg(s) + Cl₂(g) → MgCl₂(s). Calcium reacts with chlorine to form calcium chloride. Ca(s) + Cl₂(g) → CaCl₂(s). 4) Reaction with acids. Calcium reacts vigorously with acids producing a salt and hydrogen gas. Magnesium reacts steadily with acids forming a salt and hydrogen gas. E.g., magnesium reacts with dilute sulphuric acid forming magnesium sulphate and hydrogen gas. Mg(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → MgSO₄(aq) + H₂(g). Magnesium reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid giving off hydrogen gas. Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl₂(s) + H₂(g). Uses of alkaline earth metals. Alkaline earth metals boast diverse applications. Beryllium, prized for its light weight and strength, conquers the skies in high-speed aircraft and missiles, braves radiation in nuclear reactors, and even communicates with us through satellites. Magnesium's flash illuminates photography and pyrotechnics, while its calming presence soothes stomachaches (through magnesium hydroxide in antacids). Calcium, the bone builder, strengthens our bodies and our infrastructure through construction materials (as lime in plaster and mortar) and crucially stabilises roads with calcium chloride, all while finding its way into fortified foods, paints, and even water purification. Strontium contributes vibrant reds to fireworks and holds promise for bone growth, while barium finds applications in crafting specialised glasses and x-ray imaging. Transition metals. Occupying the d-block of the periodic table, between Group II and Group III, transition metals like zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni), showcase remarkable properties. Their high densities and melting/boiling points reflect strong metallic bonding. Unlike most metals with fixed valences, transition metals exhibit variable oxidation states due to the partially filled d-orbitals, allowing them to form a wider range of colourful compounds. Additionally, many transition metals or their compounds act as excellent catalysts, accelerating chemical reactions without being consumed themselves. These unique attributes make them irreplaceable in diverse fields like construction, transportation, electronics, and medicine. Halogens (Group VII). Occupying Group VII, halogens aptly earn their name "salt formers" due to their high reactivity with metals, producing ionic salts. These elements share a distinctive characteristic: Seven electrons in their outermost shell, leaving them one shy of the noble gas electron configuration. This electron deficiency translates to the highest electronegativity within their period, signifying a strong attraction for electrons. Halogens exist as diatomic molecules (F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, I₂) across the gas, liquid and solid states of matter due to the need to share electrons and achieve a complete outer shell, mirroring the electron sharing observed in their ionic salt formation. Notably, unlike many nonmetals, halogens exhibit a range of colours (refer to the colour chart). Down Group VII, the halogens exhibit a clear pattern dictated by increasing atomic size due to additional electron shells. This leads to a larger atomic radius and weaker nuclear attraction for outer electrons. Consequently, the physical states of halogens transition from gases (fluorine and chlorine) to a liquid (bromine) and then to solids (iodine and astatine) at room temperature. This shift is due to slightly stronger London dispersion forces between larger, heavier atoms. Despite this, halogens maintain relatively low melting and boiling points compared to other elements, reflecting the overall weakness of these forces. Water solubility decreases down the group, with iodine being the least soluble, due to less favourable interactions between larger halogen molecules and water. Halogens also exhibit poor electrical and thermal conductivity, consistent throughout the group due to their nonmetallic nature. Chemical reactions of halogens. Halogens are the most reactive nonmetals, with their reactivity decreasing down the group: Fluorine > Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine > Astatine. This trend follows their order in the periodic table and is due to the way these elements react by gaining electrons. As the atomic radius increases down the group, the ability of the nucleus to attract an incoming electron diminishes. Therefore, smaller halogen atoms, with a stronger nuclear attraction for electrons, are more reactive. Fluorine, being the smallest halogen, is the most reactive, as its nucleus can most effectively attract and gain an electron, while astatine, the largest, is the least reactive. (a) Reaction with metals. Most heated metals continue to burn in halogens to form salts (metal halides). Metal(s) + halogen(g) → metal halide(s). This process, often accompanied by the release of heat, can be exemplified by the dramatic reaction between sodium and chlorine gas. Sodium continues to burn in a gas jar of chlorine to form dense white fumes which settle as white solids of sodium chloride (table salt). 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s). Similar reactions occur with other metals like zinc (forming zinc chloride) and iron (producing ferric chloride). Zn(s) + Cl₂(g) → ZnCl₂(s). 2Fe(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → 2FeCl₃(s). (b) Reaction with water. Halogens react with water to form a mixture of acids, with the reactivity and properties of these solutions varying down the group. For instance, chlorine dissolves in water to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), creating an acidic solution that turns blue litmus paper red. Cl₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HOCl(aq) + HCl(aq). This solution exhibits strong bleaching properties due to hypochlorous acid's ability to release oxygen readily to coloured compounds. Similarly, bromine reacts with water to form hydrobromic acid (HBr) and hypobromous acid (HOBr), resulting in a weakly acidic solution with weak bleaching capabilities. Br₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HOBr(aq) + HBr(aq). The general trend among halogens is a decrease in bleaching power as you move down the group, with each subsequent element forming progressively weaker bleaching solutions. (c) Reaction with alkalis. Halogens react with alkalis to form a mixture of salts and water. E.g., cold dilute sodium hydroxide reacts with chlorine to form a pale-yellow solution [A mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)]. Cl₂(g) + 2NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + NaOCl(aq) + H₂O(l). In a hot concentrated solution of an alkali (e.g., NaOH), sodium hypochlorite is not formed, but instead, sodium hypochlorate is formed (NaOCl₃). 3Cl₂(g) + 6NaOH(aq) → 5NaCl(aq) + NaOCl₃(aq) + 3H₂O(l). (d) Displacement reaction of halogens. A halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from its solutions. When chlorine is bubbled through a colourless solution of potassium bromide, the solution gradually changes to red-brown as bromine is displaced from its solution by chlorine. 2KBr(aq) + Cl₂(g) → 2KCl(aq) + Br₂(g). If chlorine is bubbled through a colourless solution of potassium iodide, the solution turns dark brown, as iodine is displaced from its solution. 2KI(aq) + Cl₂(g) → 2KCl(aq) + I₂(g). Uses of halogens. Chlorine is widely utilised as a household bleach and as a disinfectant for swimming pools due to its strong oxidising properties, which effectively eliminate bacteria and algae. It is a key component in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid, a fundamental chemical in various industrial processes. In the paper and textile industries, chlorine is employed for bleaching purposes, essential for achieving desired brightness and colour in paper and fabrics. Additionally, it is a crucial ingredient in the production of weed killers, where its reactivity targets and destroys unwanted plant life. Iodine's medical applications stem from its antiseptic properties, making tincture of iodine a valuable topical treatment for wounds and skin infections. Iodine is also used in the synthesis of antibacterial agents, contributing to the development of pharmaceuticals that combat microbial infections. In the photographic industry, bromine is indispensable for its role in the formation of silver bromide, a light-sensitive compound, crucial for capturing images. Furthermore, bromine serves as an additive in petrol to reduce engine knocking, enhancing fuel efficiency and performance in vehicles. Noble gases [Group VIII (O) elements]. They are the least reactive nonmetals and are sometimes referred to as the inert elements. This is because of completely filled outermost energy levels which make them stable. Helium (He) [2] [2]. Neon (Ne) [10] [2:8]. Argon (Ar) [18] [2:8:8]. The term "noble" for noble gases reflects a historical view where these elements were seen as exceptionally stable and unreactive. This stability was likened to the nobility of the time, who were perceived as having a superior social status. While the social comparison is outdated, it highlights the historical understanding of noble gases as inert and reluctant to participate in chemical reactions. Characteristics of noble gases. 1) Their outer most energy levels are completely filled with electrons, making them very stable elements and chemically non-reactive. However, in spite of their stable electronic configurations, a few compounds have been formed from xenon (e.g., Xenon (II) fluoride, XeF₂) and krypton (E.g., krypton (II) fluoride, KrF₂). 2) The noble gases exist as monatomic gases. 3) They have very low melting and boiling points due to the negligible forces of attraction between the atoms. 4) Noble gases are colourless. Uses of noble gases. Noble gases find various practical applications due to their unique properties. Helium, being a lightweight gas, is employed in inflating airships, weather balloons, and aeroplane tyres because it offers buoyancy without the risk of combustion. Neon is extensively used in neon lights for advertisement and in lasers due to its ability to emit bright and colourful light when electrified. Argon plays a crucial role in electric light bulbs by preventing oxidation of the tungsten filament, which can darken the bulb's glass. Moreover, argon provides an inert environment for gas-liquid chromatography, ensures safety in welding operations by displacing reactive gases, and facilitates certain chemical reactions requiring an oxygen-free environment. Additionally, divers use a mixture of oxygen and helium instead of air to prevent the risk of decompression sickness during deep dives. • In groups, research, discuss and report on: • the electron arrangement of elements in each group and across each period; • the positions of the metals, non-metals and semi-metals; • trends in physical properties, such as melting point, boiling point, and density, across the periods; • trends from metals to non-metals (from sodium to argon); Have a class discussion and make conclusions about the trends. [Assignment 3] {Detail the trends in typical, physical, and chemical properties of simple compounds of the elements of the third period}. The elements of the third period of the periodic table form a variety of simple compounds, including hydrides, oxides, hydroxides, and halides (refer to the chemical families above, Chapter 3.1, Air, and Chapter 3.2, Water). Note that argon, being a noble gas, it does not react. In summary: Reactions with hydrogen (H₂): 2Na(s) + H₂(g) → 2NaH(s).

Cl₂(g) + H₂O(l) → HCl(aq) + HClO(aq) (dissolves to form hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid). Reactions with Chlorine (Cl₂): 2Na(s) + Cl₂(g) → 2NaCl(s) (highly exothermic reaction, vigorous reaction). Mg(s) + Cl₂(g) → MgCl₂(s) (exothermic reaction). 2Al(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → 2AlCl₃(s) (exothermic reaction, forms white AlCl₃ that can sublime). Si(s) + 2Cl₂(g) → SiCl₄(l) (requires heat, produces colourless liquid silicon tetrachloride). Phosphorus (P): Depending on conditions, two products are possible: 2P(s) + 3Cl₂(g) → 2PCl₃(l) (phosphorus trichloride) (white fumes in moist air). PCl₃(l) + Cl₂(g) → PCl₅(s) (phosphorus pentachloride) (white solid, highly reactive). S(s) + Cl₂(g) → SCl₂(l) (yellowish liquid sulphur dichloride). Cl: No reaction (chlorine already exists as a diatomic molecule). Simple compounds of the elements of the third period exhibit a range of typical, physical, and chemical properties that change systematically across the period. Understanding these trends is essential for grasping the behaviour and reactivity of these elements in different chemical contexts. Hydrides: Elements in the third period form two main categories of hydrides. Metals readily donate an electron to hydrogen, forming ionic hydrides (NaH, MgH₂ and AlH₃). These hydrides react vigorously with water to release hydrogen gas. Silane (SiH₄) has low reactivity with water at room temperature, but it can react under specific conditions. On the other hand, nonmetals like phosphorus, sulphur, and chlorine share electrons with hydrogen to create covalent hydrides [PH₃, H₂S, HCl]. These covalent hydrides exhibit a wider range of properties. For instance, phosphine (PH₃) is a flammable gas, while H₂S is a toxic gas with a foul odour, and hydrogen chloride (HCl) readily dissolves in water to form the strong acid, hydrochloric acid. Oxides: The third period showcases a range of oxide behaviour. Metal Oxides like Na₂O and MgO are basic (react with acids to form a salt and water only), with Al₂O₃ being amphoteric (reacting with both acids and bases). Metalloid oxide, SiO₂, is a weak acid, forming silicic acid in water. It also reacts with hot concentrated alkalis. Nonmetal oxides like phosphorus oxides (P₄O₆, P₄O₁₀) and sulphur oxides (SO₂, SO₃) are acidic (react with bases to form a salt and water only). Chlorine oxides are also acidic. These metal oxides and SiO₂ have high melting and boiling points because a large amount of heat energy is needed to break the strong bonds which are ionic and covalent respectively. The oxides of P, S and Cl consist of simple molecules with low melting and boiling points. Solubility also varies: Na₂O and MgO dissolve in water (MgO only slightly) to give basic solutions. Al₂O₃ and SiO₂ are insoluble in water. P₄O₁₀ and SO₂ dissolve in water to give acidic solutions. Hydroxides: The hydroxide behaviour of the third-period elements demonstrates a fascinating progression. Moving from left to right across the period, hydroxides transition from basic to amphoteric compounds. For example, NaOH and Mg(OH)₂ are classic examples of basic hydroxides. However, Al(OH)₃ showcases amphoteric behaviour, capable of reacting with both acids and bases. Silicic acid too, exhibits amphoteric behaviour. In contrast, elements like phosphorus and sulphur yield acidic solutions upon interaction with water, forming H₃PO₄ and H₂SO₄, respectively. Similarly, chlorine forms HOCl upon interaction with water under certain conditions. These trends are intricately linked to the electronegativity of the elements; as electronegativity increases, hydroxides tend to exhibit more acidic properties. This is also reflected in their solubility patterns, with basic hydroxides like NaOH being highly soluble, amphoteric hydroxides like Al(OH)₃ being insoluble, and acidic compounds like H₂SO₄ being readily soluble. Halides: Halides can be broadly categorised into metal halides and nonmetal halides. Metal halides are primarily ionic compounds. However, AlCl₃ exhibits some covalent character and forms dimers (Al₂Cl₆) in the gas phase. On the other hand, SiCl₄ and nonmetal halides, like PCl₃, PCl₅, SCl₂, and Cl₂, are generally covalent compounds. The solid metal halides, NaCl, MgCl₂, and AlCl₃ have high boiling and melting points due to the large amount of heat required to break the strong ionic bonds. In contrast, the remaining chlorides of period 3 elements are volatile liquids because of the weak van der Waals forces of attraction that hold their molecules together. In summary, period 3 metals exhibit high melting points, electrical conductivity, and form basic oxides and ionic compounds. Metalloids like silicon show intermediate properties, while nonmetals exhibit lower melting points, poor conductivity, and form acidic oxides and covalent compounds. These trends reflect the underlying changes in the atomic structure and bonding as one moves across the period. • In groups, research, discuss and report on reactions of the elements of the third period with water, oxygen, and chlorine; Have a class discussion and make conclusions about the trends;
