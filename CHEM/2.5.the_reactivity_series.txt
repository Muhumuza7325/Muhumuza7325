Theme ***Order of Reactivity of Metals*** "@OMD". TOPIC 8 ***THE REACTIVITY SERIES*** "36 PERIODS". Competency; The learner evaluates data on reactivity in order to arrange metallic elements according to their reactivity. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Appreciate that metals vary in their chemical reactivity and can be arranged in a reactivity series (k, u, s); b) Understand that alloys are mixtures of a metal with other metals and/or non-metals and compare the properties of common metals with their alloys (u, s). [Assignment 1] {How do metals vary in their chemical reactivity and how can they be arranged in a reactivity series}. The chemical activity of a metal is related to its tendency to form positive ions. From quite simple experiments, metals can be arranged in order of their reactivity. Placing elements in their order of reactivity is termed as the reactivity series. The reactivity series of metals is an important concept in Chemistry and it has implications for corrosion of metals and its prevention, metal extraction and storage of reactive metals. The non-metals, carbon and hydrogen are often included in the reactivity series. This is so crucial when determining the extraction method of a specific metal from its ore. Generally, a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compounds. When subjected to different conditions, metals react differently. Revisit the chapter of air and have a look at the reactions of metals with oxygen. The reaction of metals with air can be used to produce the metal reactivity series from the most reactive to the least reactive. Revisit the chapter of water and have a look at the reactions of metals with cold or hot water. Also have a look at the reduction action of hydrogen (investigate the reaction between copper (II) oxide and hydrogen gas). To compare the reactivity of metals with water, one should ensure that: a) The physical state of water is the same; b) The amount of water or metal used should be maintained; c) The same time duration is used; d) The metals should be in the same state of sub-divisions. The reaction of metals with water can be used to produce the metal reactivity series from the most reactive to the least reactive. The procedure however is not a fair one since it works well for only a few metals, those that react with water. Please note that we shall once again explore the reactions of metals with air and water in form four (Trends in the Periodic table, Topic 17). Revisit the chapter of acids and alkalis and have a look at the reactivity of metals with acids. The rate of a reaction between an acid and a metal depends on the metal used and its position in the reactivity series. Competition for Oxygen and ions between metals. When a mixture of magnesium powder and copper (II) Oxide powder are put in a crucible and heated strongly, the mixture glows red and the black powder changes to a brown solid. However, when a mixture of magnesium oxide and copper are heated, there is no observable change. Magnesium is more reactive than copper since it displaces copper from copper (II) oxide and yet copper doesn’t displace magnesium from magnesium oxide. The more reactive metal will displace the less reactive one from its oxide. When Iron (III) oxide is mixed with Aluminium and the mixture heated strongly using a magnesium fuse, a very violent reaction occurs as the competition between the Aluminium and the Iron for the Oxygen takes place. Aluminium being the more reactive metal, removes oxygen from the less reactive Iron. This is an exothermic reaction that leaves a solid lump of Iron along with a lot of white Aluminium oxide powder. Since large amounts of heat are given out and Iron is formed in a molten state, this reaction is used in making explosive bombs and in welding together damaged railway lines. Aluminium reacts rapidly with oxygen forming a thin coat of Aluminium oxide that can’t be seen which sticks tight to the metal, acting as a barrier preventing further corrosion. Therefore, Aluminium metal protects itself and behaves as if it were nonreactive. It's for this reason that Aluminium though more reactive than Iron is preferred for things like TV aerials, satellite dishes, cooking foil and ladders, without adding any protection to it. Revisit the chapter of the periodic table and have a look at the relationship between electron structure and reactivity of elements. For metal elements in the same period, the less the number of electrons required to be lost to form a stable ion, the more reactive the element is. The size of the metal atom also determines the ease with which the atom loses an electron. The bigger the metal atom, the more reactive the element will be. In a big metal atom, the electrons are farther away from the attraction of the nucleus and they therefore require less energy to be removed. In addition, there are more electron shells between the nucleus and outermost electrons. These shells shield the outermost shell electrons from the attraction of the nucleus. Generally, the metal atom which readily loses electrons, displaces those which don’t easily lose electrons. The more reactive metal ends up in the compound. A displacement reaction is a reaction involving an element replacing another element from its compound in an aqueous solution or its oxide. For example, in the reaction between iron and copper (II) sulphate solution, iron that is more reactive, displaces copper (II) ions (the blue solution turns green and a reddish-brown solid is formed on the surface of the iron). Generally, elements displace other elements below them in the reactivity series. Metals lower in the reactivity series are extracted from their oxides using carbon, which readily removes oxygen from their oxides to form a metal and carbondioxide. For example, copper can be extracted from its oxide by heating copper (II) oxide with charcoal. Procedure: Create a small cavity in the charcoal block; Place about a spatula-endful of copper (II) oxide in the cavity and wet it with one drop of water; By means of the blow pipe, direct the Bunsen burner flame onto the copper (II) oxide in the cavity; Observe and record what happens to the oxide and the charcoal block. Observation: The black solid turns to a brown solid and bubbles of a colourless gas which turn lime water milky are produced. 2CuO(s) + C(s) → 2Cu(s) + CO₂(g). The carbon in the charcoal may also first react with oxygen forming carbon monoxide gas, and then finally, this gas reduces the copper (II) oxide to copper metal. 2C(s) + O₂(g) → 2CO(g). CuO(s) + CO(g) → Cu(s) + CO₂(g). This indicates that copper is less reactive than Carbon. If a metal is less reactive than carbon, it can be extracted from its oxide by heating the oxide with carbon. Carbon displaces the metal from its oxide by removing oxygen from the oxide, leaving the metal behind. Metals that are less reactive than carbon have been known and used for thousands of years because they can be easily obtained from their ores. Note: Aluminium, Group I and Group II elements are above carbon in the reactivity series and therefore can’t be extracted on a charcoal block since their oxides can’t be reduced by carbon. More reactive metals had to wait until the invention of electrolysis in 1800, for their extraction. Revisit the chapter of carbon in the environment and explore in detail the Reducing Action of Carbon. Carbon and hydrogen are included within the series for reference and more metals like tin, nickel and platinum can be included once more experiments are done. Meaning the new reactivity series could be (K [Possiano], Na [Son], Ca [come], Mg [Making], Al [A], C [Carbonic], Zn [Z], Fe [In], Sn [The], Pb [Left], H [Hand], Cu [Continue], Hg [My], Ag [Silly], Au [Gold], Pt [Please]). Metals lower in the series have low affinity for other substances and thus are found in an uncombined state. From the reactivity series, Gold is one of the least reactive metals hence it exists freely. Gold doesn’t easily react with oxygen, chlorine, water or carbon, hence can be recovered in its pure form from alluvial deposits. However, a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid (aqua regia) can dissolve Gold. The reactivity series enables one predict how metals will react with acids and water; It tells one whether a given metal will displace a metal of interest from its compound; It also enables one choose a metal to act as a sacrificial layer for Iron, one of the metals with a variety of uses. For example, Zinc is used to coat Iron since it is more reactive than Iron. [Assignment 2] {What are alloys and how do their properties compare with those of metals}. To improve the efficiency, appearance and strength of metals, two or more metals or carbon are mixed to form an alloy. For more details about alloys, revisit your work on solid-solid mixtures in the chapter “Elements, Compounds and Mixtures”. In particular, Gold is preferred for making jewellery. This is because it is rare, has an attractive lustre, doesn't tarnish, doesn't react with air the way some metals do, and is malleable and ductile. Gold is often alloyed with other metals to make it stronger. 16 or 18 karat gold alloys are usually used for jewellery. White gold, an alloy of Gold with metals like nickel and silver, is a favourite material for wedding rings. Plating white gold with rhodium, gives it more shine. Rose gold is an alloy of gold and copper. When it is alloyed with little copper, it is yellow gold. Gold is blue when alloyed with iron or indium, purple when alloyed with Aluminium, Black when alloyed with cobalt and green when alloyed with silver alone. Pieces of costume jewellery are also plated with the thinnest sheets of gold to enhance their appearance. To conclude, we discover that it is the unreactive metals for which we find the most uses. The least reactive iron and copper are found in everyday objects. Aluminium, however, is an exception (refer to your notes). The reactive metals are also used for several other reasons. Sodium can be used as a coolant in nuclear reactors. This is because sodium has a low melting point and is a good conductor of heat. • In groups design and carry out an investigation, using the scientific method, to compare the reactivity of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium and zinc placed in cold water and dilute hydrochloric acid. Discuss how you will measure and record the level of ‘reactivity’ and evaluate the limitations of the investigation. • Individually, research on how the reactivity of an element depends on its electronic structure, and draw structure diagrams of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium and zinc to explain their level of reactivity and how this determines their uses. • In small groups, use a charcoal block and blowpipe to extract copper from copper oxide, explaining your observations and writing a word equation for the process. Research and discuss with the wider group why the more reactive metals (e.g., groups I and II metals and aluminium) cannot be extracted on a charcoal block, and how gold is an uncombined metal at the bottom of the reactivity series that can be recovered in pure form from alluvial deposits. • In groups, examine a collection of objects made from or containing alloys. Research and report on the difference in chemical composition and properties, and then explain on a poster how this determines their use;
