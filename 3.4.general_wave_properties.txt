Theme ***Waves*** "@OMD". TOPIC 4 ***GENERAL WAVE PROPERTIES*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to investigate the properties of transverse and longitudinal wave forms and explain how waves transmit energy. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand that energy is transferred by waves, and these may be transverse or longitudinal (k, u); b) know and use the relationship between velocity, frequency, and wavelength (k, s); c) understand the propagation, properties, and uses of electromagnetic waves, and that white light is a mixture of frequencies but that light from a laser is a single frequency (k, u, v/a). • In pairs, research and present on: • how waves transfer energy, • the basic features of waves (e.g., amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and period); • examples of waves as • mechanical and electromagnetic • transverse and longitudinal • progressive and stationary. • In groups, use a ripple tank to investigate the nature of transverse and longitudinal waves, present your findings and use the equation: velocity = wavelength x frequency to solve simple numerical problems. • In pairs, research and explain: • the propagation and properties of electromagnetic waves and their applications • the nature of white light and light from a laser and its uses • the effects of over-exposure to ultraviolet (UV) and other forms of high frequency electromagnetic radiation • the production, applications, and effects of X-rays as a form of electromagnetic waves;
