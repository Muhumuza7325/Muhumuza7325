Item 2 [UNEB SAMPLE PAPER]: Biteke Secondary School had some classroom blocks constructed using wood.  After One year, the head teacher realised that the poles in S1 classroom block were partly destroyed with holes in them. The school had spent a lot of money on the classroom block and did not have any money to construct another one. Specimens X and Y were some of the most common organisms that S.1 students collected from their classrooms.#Task:#(a) (i) How do the features on the organisms enable the organism to enter and survive in the classroom?#Organism Y sensed the location of the classroom and possible food source using its compound eyes and antennae respectively. It used its wings to fly and entered the classroom. It survives by using its proboscis to feed on liquid food available in the classroom.#Organism X sensed the location of food/wood in the classroom block using its antennae. It used its mandibles to dig barrows to access the classroom block and feed on the wood.#(ii) Explain to the head teacher which organism was able to cause such serious damage to the classroom block.#Organism X is responsible for the damage caused. This is because it has hard and strong pair of mandibles that are capable of cutting the timber/wood in the classroom block. It can feed on solid materials such as wood#(b) Draw and label the head of specimen X.#A drawing of the head of specimen X
