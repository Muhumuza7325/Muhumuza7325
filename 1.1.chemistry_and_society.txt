Theme ***Introduction to chemistry and experimental techniques*** "@OMD". TOPIC 1.1 ***CHEMISTRY AND SOCIETY*** "6 PERIODS". Competency; The learner assesses the application of chemistry in our everyday life and its contribution to our economy. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) Know appropriate activities to explain the discrete nature of chemistry (k, u); b) Understand why chemistry is studied and how it overlaps with other subjects such as biology, physics, mathematics, and geology (k, u); c) Understand the importance of chemistry and relate knowledge of chemistry to relevant careers (u); d) Know the contribution of chemistry to the Ugandan economy (k). The 4-year Syllabus for Chemistry is one of the 20 subjects of the Lower Secondary School Curriculum of Uganda. The Syllabus builds upon concepts, skills, attitudes, and values developed at the primary school level, which provide a firm foundation for further learning of Chemistry. The key change in the new curriculum is a move from a knowledge-based curriculum to a competence and skill-based curriculum. It is no longer sufficient to accumulate large amounts of knowledge. Young people need to develop the ability to apply their learning with confidence in a range of situations. Thus, the curriculum requires an active, learner-centred rather than passive, teacher-centred approach. The role of the teacher is to build on learners’ existing knowledge and experience through posing problems to the learners. The new curriculum focuses on 4 “Key learning outcomes”: self–assured individuals, responsible and patriotic citizens, lifelong learners, and positive contributors to society. The curriculum emphasises knowledge, application, and behavioural change. At the heart of every subject, there are generic skills (Communication, Co-operation and Self-directed Learning, Critical thinking and problem-solving, Creativity and innovation, among many others) that allow development into lifelong learners. Besides, there are also cross cutting challenges that are embedded across subjects to enable learners understand the connections between the subjects and complexities of life. Chemistry is a compulsory subject from Senior 1 to Senior 4. The chemistry syllabus aims to: • Enable learners appreciate and understand natural phenomena and the ways in which materials behave; • Make learners aware of the power, impact, and influence which Chemistry has in a modern scientific world and, to emphasise that there is a responsibility that Chemistry plays using the scientific approach. Chemistry is concerned with the physical and chemical properties of substances and the interaction of energy and matter. It is a practical subject and therefore it is studied normally in a special place called the laboratory. The study of Chemistry involves an investigation into chemical reactions and processes. The discipline seeks to explain and predict events at the atomic and molecular level. Chemistry as a practical science tries to answer the following questions: What are materials made up of? How is matter formed? How does matter behave? And, why does matter behave the way it does? There are quite a number of branches of chemistry such as Organic chemistry, Physical chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical chemistry. Organic Chemistry focuses on carbon-containing compounds, studying their structure, properties, synthesis, and reactions, along with their applications in different fields. Inorganic Chemistry deals with compounds lacking carbon-hydrogen bonds, exploring their properties, synthesis, and reactions, pivotal in catalysis, materials science, and coordination chemistry. Physical Chemistry applies the principles of physics to understand chemical systems and processes, investigating topics like thermodynamics, kinetics, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry, contributing to chemical engineering and materials science. Analytical Chemistry is concerned with qualitative and quantitative analysis of substances to determine composition and properties, employing techniques such as spectroscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, vital in pharmaceuticals, environmental science, and forensic science. Chemistry as an experimental subject relies on: Careful handling of apparatus. Carrying out chemical tests or chemical analysis. Making critical observations. Critical reporting of observations. Drawing appropriate conclusions from observations. Aims of studying chemistry: It may be easy to underestimate the central role of chemistry in modern society, but chemical products are essential if the world’s population is to be clothed, housed, and fed. a) Observational Skills and Reporting: Acquire observational skills and accurately report findings to enhance scientific inquiry and communication. b) Handling instruments and Predicting outcomes: Develop proficiency in handling instruments and predicting experimental outcomes to conduct experiments effectively. c) Environmental Awareness, Care, and Protection: Foster environmental awareness, care for the surroundings, and understand the effects of chemicals on the environment to promote environmental protection. d) Appreciation and Proper Use of Chemical Products: An individual appreciates chemical products such as soap, detergents, cosmetics, textiles, drugs, plastics etc., and understands their proper usage in various applications, ensuring safety and efficacy. e) Career Opportunities and Professional Development: Enable individuals to pursue diverse careers and professional paths in fields such as medicine, education, pharmacy, and other science-related disciplines. f) Contribution to Science, Technology, and Innovation: Contribute to advancements in science and technology, driving innovation and enhancing the quality of human life through the application of chemical knowledge and discoveries.

Suggested Learning Activities; • In groups, discuss what you already know about chemistry and common chemicals in pharmaceutics and cosmetics, plastics, food and beverages, soaps and detergents, water treatment, and indigenous chemistry in local environments; Then produce a mind-map to show your conclusions. • In groups, brainstorm why we study chemistry and careers related to knowledge of chemistry, areas such as human and animal medicine, pharmacy, chemical engineering, teaching, etc; Then produce a table to present your ideas. • Research how chemistry contributes to the economy of Uganda: medicines, industries, transport, and agriculture. • In groups, make a field visit and carry out research to explore the common industrial products in our country and relate their uses to the importance of chemistry; Write a report on your research and give a presentation in class. • Individually, write reports of visits to show knowledge of the importance of chemistry to the Ugandan society;
