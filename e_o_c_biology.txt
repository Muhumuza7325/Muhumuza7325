1. Plant biology (Botany): Understand how plants obtain and use nutrients to meet their requirements during which raw materials and products are carried to and from various organs involved: • Nutrition in plants • Transport in plants • Respiration in plants • Growth & development in plants.

2. Human physiology: Appreciate how a human body coordinates various activities and adjust to ensure normal functioning of body systems. • Coordination • Homeostasis • Osmoregulation • Locomotion.

3. Inheritance characters and their variation: Appreciate how traits are inherited in organisms, passed to generations through reproduction and are manifested as organisms grow: • Genetics [inheritance & variation] • Cell division • Reproduction • Growth & development.

4. Diversity of organisms & sustainability of natural resources: Appreciate diversity of organisms & sustainability of natural resources [diversify of organisms, soil, pollution & conservation]: • Introduction to biology • Classification • Cell biology • Viruses • Insects • Flowering plants • Ecology (concept of ecology, food webs & food chains, community interactions, human & natural environment) • Soil.

5. Animal biology (zoology): Understand how mammals (animals) obtain & use nutrients to meet their energy requirements during which raw materials and products are carried to & from different organs involved: • Nutrition in animals • Transport in animals • Respiration in animals • Gaseous exchange in animals • Excretion in animals • Growth & development in animals.

6. Scientific investigation / inquiry: • Food tests • Soil experiments • Osmosis • Germination.

7. Either: Animal anatomy: • Insects/arthropods • Bones/skeletal system • Teeth: Or: Plant anatomy: • Leaves • Flowers • Fruits • Roots and stems.
