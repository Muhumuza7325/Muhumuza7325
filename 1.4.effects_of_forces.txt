Theme ***Mechanics and Properties of Matter*** "@OMD". TOPIC 4 ***THE EFFECTS OF FORCES*** "16 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to explore the nature and types of force and describe how forces move or change the shape of objects, and understand some common applications of forces. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know that a force is a push or a pull and that the unit of force is the Newton (k); b) know the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on objects (k, s); c) understand the existence of the force of gravity and distinguish between mass and weight (u); d) appreciate that the weight of a body depends on the size of the force of gravity acting upon it (k, u, v/a); e) understand the concept of friction in everyday life contexts (u); f) understand the meaning of adhesion and cohesion as forms of molecular forces (u); g) explain surface tension and capillarity in terms of adhesion and cohesion and their application (u, v/a). • In pairs, use springs, rubber bands, and force meters to research, push, and pull forces and use this to • explain the meaning of force • identify a variety of forces and give instances where they occur • categorise forces as contact and non- contact • demonstrate the effects of forces on objects • identify examples of the effects of forces (change of movement and/or shape) on objects • express forces in Newtons and use the symbol N. • In pairs: • consider a tug of war to explain forces and predict in diagrams what will happen when the pulling forces of the teams are: a) unbalanced and; b) balanced. • calculate resultant forces when linear and perpendicular forces are applied to an object. • In groups, draw on prior learning and research about gravity and explain in a presentation: • why gravity is less on the moon than on Earth • why objects are attracted to the Earth • why the Earth revolves around the sun • applications of force of gravity such as irrigation in farming and other consequences of weight • the relationship between mass and weight (W=mg). • why the weight of a body depends on the size of the force of gravity acting upon it • In groups, draw on prior learning to explain friction, and plan and carry out a practical investigation to find the effects and use of frictional forces to explain: • the factors that affect frictional force between two surfaces in contact and determine the limiting friction between them • ways of reducing or increasing friction • why heavy objects can be more easily moved on rollers • why objects slide more easily across a smooth surface than a rough surface • why car tyres become smoother and thinner with time and why tyre tread is important • why it is easier to write with a pencil on paper rather than on glossy plastic • In groups, investigate the existence of surface tension on water, observe demonstrations and explain in a presentation: • the effects of spraying a layer of oil on the water surface in ponds • capillarity, cohesion, and adhesion and explore with glass tubes of different diameters; • real life examples of adhesion and cohesion (e.g., damp course in buildings, and fluid flow in plant stems) Note: 1) Treatment of F=ma not required at this point; 2) Both scale drawing and mathematical (Pythagoras theorem) method can be used to obtain the resultant force of perpendicular forces; 3) The angle at which the resultant is inclined is not required; 4) Only the qualitative treatment of friction is required; 5) The use of the expression W=mg to be emphasized; 6) Emphasise the meaning rather than the definition of surface tension; 7) Mathematical treatment of surface tension is beyond the scope of this syllabus.
