What kind of places are they? • Explain two types of fishing areas: • the sea and coast • lakes and rivers. • Use wall map, Chalk board sketch map or atlas map to show main fishing areas in East Africa. • copy map as sketch map or create digital maps. Methods of fishing • If possible, visit an area where fishing takes place. Find out the types of fish caught, methods used to catch fish, where and how the fish are sold and problems the fishing people face. • Discuss about the types of methods used to catch fish. Volunteers then sketch these on the chalk board and explain each method. Use artefacts, where possible, and research images of traditional fishing methods. • Individually, draw annotated diagrams of the equipment used in fishing, and research the methods used (spears, nets, fishing lines, traps, baskets, bow and arrow). • Use photographs, video and other research to draw annotated diagrams of modern fishing methods and explain these (trawling, drift nets, dynamite blasting). Or you could annotate digital images. • Use Internet to find out information about fishing in East Africa • In groups, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method of fishing and whether traditional or modern methods are best for conserving fish. • Explain dangers of some modern fishing methods (drift net and blasting) and why these are banned. • Suggest dangers of using nets with small holes and catching too many young fish and why people do it. Preservation of fish • Brainstorm what you know about methods of preserving fish so they can be sent to long distance markets (smoking, salting, sun-drying, canning, refrigeration). Factors favouring fishing • In groups, discuss factors which you think will encourage fishing. • Present your views to the whole class. Explain and expand group views where necessary. Benefits of the fishing industry • In groups, discuss and list the benefits the fishing communities and the country can get from fishing. Problems of the fishing industry. Discuss the dangers to fishing in East Africa e.g.: • over-fishing • catching young fish • pollution of water by human waste and chemicals from farming (fertilizers etc.,) and industries etc. Improvement of fishing • As a class, discuss and suggest how the above problems can be solved. Which of the suggested solutions are most effective and Why? • Elicit responses and explain with examples where necessary. Fish farming • Explain that one way to increase fish production is to farm fish. • Using picture(s) of a fish farm, explore how fish are farmed and the benefits of fish farming.
