## Installation Instructions for MacOS and Linux

1.  **Create the Omd directory:**
    Open your file manager. Navigate to your home directory (usually represented by a house icon or your username). If a directory named `Omd` does not exist, create a new directory and name it `Omd`. Make sure only "O" is uppercase.

2.  **Extract and Make Executable the Scripts:**
    Open the downloaded ZIP archive and locate the files ending with `_tutorial.sh`. Extract these files into the `Omd` directory you just created in your home directory. Choose files bearing the names of the subjects you are interested in.

    Next, you need to make these files executable. Open your terminal application. Type `chmod +x ~/Omd/*.sh` and press Enter. This command gives the scripts permission to run.

3.  **Extract the Desktop Shortcuts:**
    Locate the files ending with `_tutorial.desktop` in the downloaded ZIP archive. Extract these files to your Desktop. Equally choose files bearing the names of the subjects you are interested in.

    
4.  **Extract and Rename the Logo:**
    From the downloaded ZIP archive, find the file named `logo.jpeg`. Extract this file into the `Omd` directory in your home directory. This will allow the desktop shortcut to have our logo. Once it's there, rename the file to `.logo.jpeg` (note the dot at the beginning). This often makes the file hidden in some file managers. 

5.  **Delete the downloaded Zip archive (Optional):**
    At this stage (After extracting all the necessary files). You are free to delete the downloaded ZIP archive.

6.  **Allow Launching the Shortcuts:**
    Go to your Desktop and find the desktop files ending with `_tutorial.desktop`. Right-click on each. Look for an option that allows you to trust or allow launching the application. This might be in a "Permissions" tab or a context menu option like "Allow Launching" or similar. Enable this for each.

7.  **Start Learning:**
    Double-click the shortcuts on your Desktop to begin your learning experience. Note that content of some subjects is still being developed. We wish you all the best.
