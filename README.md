## Installation Instructions for MacOS and Linux

1.  **Create the Omd directory:**
    Open your file manager. Navigate to your home directory (usually represented by a house icon or your username). If a directory named `Omd` does not exist, create a new directory and name it `Omd`. Mind about the case of the letters (Its only `O` thats upper case. m and d are lower case letters).

2.  **Extract and Make Executable the Script:**
    Open the downloaded ZIP archive and locate the file named `chemistry_tutorial.sh`. Extract this file into the `Omd` directory you just created in your home directory.

    Next, you need to make this file executable. Open your terminal application. Type `chmod +x ~/Omd/chemistry_tutorial.sh` and press Enter. This command gives the script permission to run.

3.  **Extract and Rename the Logo:**
    From the downloaded ZIP archive, find the file named `logo.jpeg`. Extract this file into the `Omd` directory in your home directory. Once it's there, rename the file to `.logo.jpeg` (note the dot at the beginning). This often makes the file hidden in some file managers.

4.  **Extract the Desktop Shortcut:**
    Locate the file named `chemistry_tutorial.desktop` in the downloaded ZIP archive. Extract this file to your Desktop.
    
5.  **Delete the downloaded Zip archive:**
    At this stage. You are free to delete the downloaded ZIP archive.

6.  **Allow Launching the Shortcut:**
    Go to your Desktop and find the `chemistry_tutorial.desktop` file. Right-click on it. Look for an option that allows you to trust or allow launching the application. This might be in a "Permissions" tab or a context menu option like "Allow Launching" or similar. Enable this.

7.  **Start Learning:**
    Double-click the "CHEM" shortcut on your Desktop to begin your learning experience. We wish you all the best.
