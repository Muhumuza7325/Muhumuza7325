## Installation Instructions for MacOS and Linux

1.  **Create the Omd directory:**
    Open your file manager. Navigate to your home directory (usually represented by a house icon or your username). If a directory named `Omd` does not exist, create a new directory and name it `Omd`. Make sure only "O" is uppercase.

2.  **Extract and Make Executable the Script(s):**
    Open the downloaded ZIP archive and locate the files ending with `_tutorial.sh`. Extract these files into the `Omd` directory you just created in your home directory. Choose files bearing the names of the subjects you are interested in.

    Next, you need to make these files executable. Type `sudo chown -R omd:omd ~/Omd` (Remember to change omd to your user name e.g., `sudo chown -R irene:irene ~/Omd`) in the terminal and press Enter (if you don't know what and where the terminal is, search for it from the Apps on your computer). Also type `sudo chomd -R 777 ~/Omd` in the terminal and press Enter. These two commands give the scripts permission to run.

3.  **Extract the Desktop Shortcuts:**
    Locate the files ending with `_tutorial.desktop` in the downloaded ZIP archive. Extract these files to your Desktop. Equally choose files bearing the names of the subjects you are interested in.
    
4.  **Extract and Rename the Logo:**
    From the downloaded ZIP archive, find the file named `logo.jpeg`. Extract this file into the `Omd` directory in your home directory. This will allow the desktop shortcut to have our logo. Once it's there, rename the file to `.logo.jpeg` (note the dot at the beginning). This often makes the file hidden in some file managers. 

5.  **Delete the downloaded Zip archive (Optional):**
    At this stage (After extracting all the necessary files). You are free to delete the downloaded ZIP archive.

6.  **Allow Launching the Shortcuts:**
    Go to your Desktop and find the desktop files ending with `_tutorial.desktop`. Right-click on each. Look for an option that allows you to trust or allow launching the application. This might be in a "Permissions" tab or a context menu option like "Allow Launching" or similar. Enable this for each.

7.  **Start Learning:**
    Thank you for installing the Educational Pipeline(s). To begin your learning journey, simply double-click on any of the shortcuts. Please note that content for some subjects is still under development. We wish you all the best in your studies and look forward to your continued cooperation. If you have any questions or run into any difficulties, please feel free to contact us. Also remember to contact us for details on how to integrate AI (Artificial intelligence) for free into the pipeline(s).

If it does, set your username using lowercase letters, keep it as short as possible... Then also set your password... I would request you use your name as your password because we may need it to trouble shoot some things one day and if you forgot it, we will have to repeat all the above steps. The password isn't shown as you type it, so don't get worried... Enter it and press enter, then confirm it by re-entering it again and pressing enter.
