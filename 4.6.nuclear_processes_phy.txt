Theme ***Modern physics*** "@OMD". TOPIC 6 ***NUCLEAR PROCESSES*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should understand how nuclear processes occur, their uses, and the dangers associated with them Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand the processes of nuclear fission and fusion and the associated energy changes (u); b) understand the spontaneous and random nature of nuclear decay and interpret decay data in terms of half-life (k, u, s); c) know the applications of radioactivity and the dangers associated with exposure to radioactive materials. (k, u); d) understand and appreciate that there are significant social, political, and environmental dimensions associated with use of nuclear power. (u, v/a). • In groups, research and use knowledge of atomic structure to explain in a presentation/on a poster: • the processes of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion and balance nuclear reactions • how energy is produced in a controlled way in a reactor • how nuclear energy is used. • In groups, research and prepare a presentation on: • the penetrating and ionizing powers of different types of radiation • the decay of radioactive isotopes using balanced nuclear reactions • the meaning of half-life and how it may be used • background radiation and its origin • why waste containing radioactive isotopes with long half-lives presents a serious environmental problem • the medical and industrial uses of nuclear material. • In pairs, research on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of nuclear materials with reference to world events; the regulations about the use and control of radioactive materials. Note: a) Calculation of half-life using decay law equation is not required at this level; However, graphical method should be emphasized; b) Details of how radiations damage the body are not required; However, occurrence of recent world nuclear accidents needs to be mentioned;
