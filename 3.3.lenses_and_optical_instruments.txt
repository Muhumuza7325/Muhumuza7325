Theme ***Light*** "@OMD". TOPIC 3 ***LENSES AND OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS*** "18 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to understand that lenses refract light to form images and these lenses can be applied in different optical instruments. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know the properties of converging and diverging lenses, and how they are used in everyday life (k, u, s); b) understand how lenses are used in optical systems such as the magnifying glass, correcting sight in the human eye and in camera lenses (k, u, v/a). • In groups: • investigate and report on how converging lenses focus light from a distant object and determine the focal length of a convex lens • draw and present ray diagrams to show the effects of converging and diverging lenses on parallel rays of light • determine focal length of convex lens, and make reports • report on how lenses are used in optical instruments such as the magnifying glass, camera, microscope, and telescope. • In pairs, research and explain in a presentation: • the optical properties of both converging and diverging lenses using the terms: principal axis, principal focus, and focal length • the structure and function of the human eye [link with Biology] • the use of lenses in correcting eye defects. Note: (i) Details on the operation of a projector, compound microscope, and telescopes should be left out; (ii) Details of how photographs are processed in lens cameras are not required; (iii) The lens formula should be left out;
