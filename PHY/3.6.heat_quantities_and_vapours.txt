Theme ***Heat*** "@OMD". TOPIC 6 ***HEAT QUANTITIES AND VAPOURS*** "20 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to explain heat capacity and latent heat, and know common applications. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand and use the concepts of heat capacity and latent heat (k, u, s); b) know and explain the implications of the high values of the specific latent heat and the specific heat capacity of water (k, u); c) carry out calculations and investigations on specific heat capacity and specific latent heat (u, s); d) understand the concept of latent heat and change of state, and use them to explain melting and boiling point (u, s); e) understand the meaning of saturated and unsaturated vapours, saturated vapour pressure, and how these terms relate to boiling and evaporation (u); f) appreciate the cooling effect of evaporation and how this contributes to maintaining constant body temperature (k, u, s, v/a). • In groups, plan, carry out and report on an investigation to find the effect of heat energy on the temperature of different materials of the same mass and explain heat capacity. • In pairs, research, discuss and explain in presentations/posters: • the applications and implications of the high specific latent heat and heat capacity of water • the role that oceans play in global temperature regulation • the loss or gain of heat when a material changes state in terms of the particle theory • the origins of the energy in a storm • why land and sea heat up and cool at different rates and the implications for the direction of sea breezes at different times of day. • In groups, plan, carry out and report on an investigation to find out how stearic acid changes with temperature and explain the findings in terms of the loss or gain of heat. • In pairs, research and report on the total heat energy required to convert ice to steam, draw the heating curve and explain: • the specific latent heat of fusion of ice, and • the application of latent heat in refrigerators • In pairs, research the difference between saturated and unsaturated vapour, review prior learning and explain in a report: • boiling and evaporation in terms of particle theory • how perspiring maintains constant body temperature in mammals • why water boils at a temperature less than 100°C at the top of a mountain • how a pressure cooker works. Note: • Determination of heat quantities should only be limited to the method of mixtures;
