Theme ***Magnetism*** "@OMD". TOPIC 6 ***MAGNETS AND MAGNETIC FIELD*** "8 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should investigate and understand the properties of magnets and explain how the Earth behaves as a magnet. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) know that a small number of materials are magnetic, but most are not (k); b) know how magnets can be made and destroyed (k, s); c) understand the behaviour of magnets and magnetic fields (u); d) know that the Earth is a magnet and how a compass is used to determine direction (k, s). • In pairs, use prior learning to discuss and classify materials in a table into magnetic or non-magnetic: [copper, nickel, iron, steel, cobalt, aluminium, steel, zinc, wood, rubber], then confirm your results with a magnet, and identify any pattern in the results. • In pairs, plan and carry out investigations using magnets and research to discover and report: • which poles attract and repel • the law of magnetism, and • which pole of a bar magnet is south and which is north • In groups, use iron filings and paper to plot magnetic fields around a bar magnet and individually draw diagrams to show the lines of force. • In pairs, do as follows, and produce a report: • investigate the strength of available magnets using a chain of small nails or pins as a measure • investigate what happens when a magnetised needle is suspended freely by a thread • research how the Earth behaves as a magnet and how a magnet can be used to navigate (Only field lines around magnets should be drawn; Magnetic field lines around current carrying conductors shall be introduced at a later time; Concept of magnetic and geographic meridians should be left out);
