Theme ***Heat*** "@OMD". TOPIC 4 ***HEAT TRANSFER*** "12 PERIODS". Competency; The learner should be able to explain the modes of heat transfer and their applications to daily life. Learning Outcomes; The learner should be able to; a) understand how heat energy is transferred and the rate at which transfer takes place (u, s); b) understand what is happening at particle level when conduction, convection, and radiation take place and their application (k, u, v/a); c) understand that greenhouse effect and global warming are aspects related to heat transfer on the earth surface (u, v/a). • In groups, design, carry out and report on investigations to show how heat is transferred in different solids, water and air to explain: • conduction in different solids in terms of particle theory • convection in liquids and air in terms of particle theory • the causes and effects of convection currents in the atmosphere and their relation to weather/climate • In groups, use prior learning to design, carry out and report on investigations to: • Compare rates of heat conduction by different materials • compare the radiation of heat from different surfaces and how heat is transferred by radiation • compare how well heat is absorbed / reflected by different surfaces. • In pairs, research and make a presentation on how heat transfer is kept to a minimum in a vacuum flask • In groups, search and make presentations on causes and effects of global warming and how the greenhouse works;
